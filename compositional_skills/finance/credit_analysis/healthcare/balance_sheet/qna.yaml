  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate PP&E in a healthcare company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the composition and valuation of PP&E, including hospitals,
      clinics, medical facilities, and specialized medical equipment. They must assess the
      age, condition, and technological relevance of these assets, and analyze CapEx trends
      for facility upgrades and regulatory compliance.
  - question: >
      How should intangible assets be assessed in the healthcare industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine intangible assets such as goodwill from acquisitions and
      intellectual property like licenses, patents, and proprietary technologies.
      Evaluating amortization policies and impairment risks is critical when acquired
      entities underperform.
  - question: >
      How can accounts receivable be analyzed on a healthcare company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should analyze the quality and aging of receivables from insurance companies,
      Medicare/Medicaid, and patients. Evaluating credit terms, billing practices, and
      calculating Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) help assess revenue cycle efficiency.
  - question: >
      How should inventory be assessed in the healthcare industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to review inventories of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.
      Evaluating inventory management practices, valuation methods (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, weighted
      average), and risks of obsolescence due to perishability and demand fluctuations is key.
  - question: >
      What liability factors are critical in analyzing a healthcare
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine short- and long-term debt obligations, pension and post-retirement
      liabilities, and reserves for malpractice claims. Evaluating interest rates, maturity
      profiles, and covenant compliance is essential to assess debt servicing capacity.
  - question: >
      How should a healthcare company's equity and capital structure be
      evaluated?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review changes in shareholders' equity, including retained earnings and
      accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as any non-controlling interests.
      Dividend policies and share repurchase programs should also be examined.
  - question: >
      How can liquidity and working capital management be assessed on a healthcare
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include current and quick ratios, along with cash and cash
      equivalents. Analysts should evaluate the management of receivables, payables, and
      inventory, considering the impact of delayed reimbursements and high operating costs.
  - question: >
      How should regulatory compliance and off-balance sheet items be
      incorporated into the analysis of a healthcare company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review compliance with healthcare regulations and assess off-balance
      sheet items such as operating leases for equipment and contingent liabilities from
      legal disputes. These factors can affect future cash flows and overall financial risk.
