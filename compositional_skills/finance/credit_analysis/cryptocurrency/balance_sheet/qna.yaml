  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate digital asset holdings on a
      cryptocurrency

      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the composition and valuation of the
      cryptocurrency portfolio,

      ensuring diversification across various coins and tokens. They must also review custody

      arrangements and security measures to mitigate theft and hacking risks.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when analyzing staking assets in a
      crypto firm?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine assets locked in staking activities, considering
      potential returns,

      lockup periods, and associated risks. Evaluating the expected rewards and liquidity of these

      assets is crucial for estimating future cash inflows.
  - question: >
      How should traditional assets be evaluated in a cryptocurrency
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Traditional assets include fiat cash and cash equivalents, as well as
      other investments,

      such as strategic stakes in blockchain companies. Analysts should review the ratio of crypto

      to fiat holdings and assess overall liquidity.
  - question: >
      What key aspects of liabilities, including customer deposits and debt,
      should be analyzed

      in a cryptocurrency firm?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate customer cryptocurrency deposits by verifying
      proper segregation,

      insurance coverage, and collection practices. In addition, both traditional debt and crypto-

      backed loans should be examined for maturity profiles and refinancing risks.
  - question: >
      How can a credit analyst assess a cryptocurrency company's equity and
      regulatory capital?
    answer: >
      The analyst should review shareholders' equity, considering the impact
      of crypto price volatility

      on asset values. Compliance with regulatory capital requirements and maintenance of adequate

      reserves for operational risks are also critical.
  - question: >
      What off-balance sheet items are unique to the cryptocurrency
      industry, and how should they

      be analyzed?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet items may include smart contract commitments and
      contingent liabilities

      arising from DeFi protocols. Analysts must assess these risks by evaluating protocol

      vulnerabilities, potential regulatory penalties, and exposure to cyber threats.
  - question: >
      How should currency and commodity exposures be managed on a
      cryptocurrency company's

      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to evaluate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on
      revenue and costs,

      particularly for companies with significant international operations. Reviewing hedging

      strategies and risk management instruments is essential.
  - question: >
      How do regulatory and cybersecurity risks affect the balance sheet of
      a cryptocurrency

      company?
    answer: >
      Regulatory changes can alter asset valuations and capital adequacy,
      while weak cybersecurity

      measures increase the risk of asset loss. Analysts should examine these factors to determine

      their overall effect on the firm's financial stability.
