  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a
      cryptocurrency

      company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should assess cash generated from core activities such as
      trading

      fees, commissions, staking rewards, and validator operations. Adjustments for

      non-cash expenses and market volatility are key, along with analyzing changes in

      digital asset inventory, customer deposit flows, and payment processor settlement

      timing.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when analyzing investing cash flow
      in the crypto

      sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review cash flows from digital asset investments,
      including the

      purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies and investments in mining or validator

      infrastructure. They should also evaluate spending on technology infrastructure,

      such as security systems and compliance tools, as well as strategic investments in

      blockchain projects.
  - question: |
      How should financing cash flows be analyzed in a cryptocurrency firm?
    answer: >
      The analysis should focus on cash inflows from equity issuance and debt
      financing,

      and outflows for debt repayments, dividends, or token distributions. Regulatory

      capital requirements and cash flows from licensing and compliance should also be

      reviewed.
  - question: >
      How do risk management activities impact the cash flow health of a
      cryptocurrency

      company?
    answer: >
      Risk management includes evaluating hedging strategies for foreign
      exchange and

      commodity risks, assessing premiums paid for crypto insurance, and reviewing spending

      on cybersecurity measures. These strategies help stabilize cash flows amid market

      volatility.
  - question: >
      What liquidity management factors are critical in evaluating a
      cryptocurrency

      company's cash flow statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate the adequacy of fiat currency reserves and
      manage the balance

      between hot and cold wallets. They must also assess access to credit facilities, liquidity

      buffers for stress scenarios, and the company's ability to meet sudden withdrawal demands.
  - question: >
      What overall insights can be drawn from a comprehensive analysis of a
      crypto firm's cash

      flow statement?
    answer: >
      By integrating the analysis of operating, investing, and financing cash
      flows with risk

      management and liquidity assessments, analysts can gauge the firm's ability to generate

      sustainable cash, mitigate market risks, and maintain strong creditworthiness.
