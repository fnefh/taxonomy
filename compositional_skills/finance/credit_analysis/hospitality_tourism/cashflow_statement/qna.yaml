  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate cash flows from operating
      activities in a hospitality company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash generated from core operations such as
      accommodations, F&B services, and event management. They must adjust for non-cash
      expenses like depreciation, amortization, impairments, and stock-based
      compensation, while also analyzing changes in working capital.
  - question: >
      What working capital components are critical in evaluating operating
      cash flow?
    answer: >
      Key components include accounts receivable from corporate clients and
      travel agencies, inventory levels of F&B supplies and amenities, and accounts
      payable to suppliers. Evaluating collection efficiency, billing practices, and
      payment terms is essential.
  - question: >
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed in the hospitality and
      tourism industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review cash outflows for CapEx on property acquisitions,
      renovations, equipment upgrades, and technology enhancements. They must also
      assess cash flows from acquisitions or divestitures of hotels, resorts, and
      strategic assets.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing financing cash flow in a
      hospitality firm?
    answer: >
      The analysis should include cash inflows from new borrowings and equity
      issuance, as well as outflows for debt repayments, share repurchases, and
      dividend payments. Debt maturity profiles and refinancing risks should be
      carefully evaluated.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated, and why is it important for
      hospitality companies?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from
      operating cash flow. It indicates the firm's ability to generate surplus cash
      for debt servicing, reinvestment, and shareholder returns, despite fluctuations
      in working capital.
  - question: >
      Which liquidity measures should be used to assess financial
      flexibility in the hospitality industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate cash and cash equivalents, current and quick
      ratios, and the availability of credit facilities. These metrics help determine
      if the company can meet short-term obligations and fund strategic initiatives
      during downturns.
  - question: >
      How does scenario analysis aid in assessing cash flow sensitivity in
      hospitality?
    answer: >
      Scenario analysis examines the impact of changes in occupancy rates,
      seasonal demand, and event bookings on cash flows. It also considers the
      effects of economic cycles and market conditions on the firm's ability to
      adjust expenditures.
  - question: >
      What risk management activities are essential for stabilizing cash
      flows in the hospitality and tourism sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review hedging strategies for interest, currency, and
      commodity risks, and evaluate insurance coverage and contingency planning
      measures to mitigate operational risks and ensure cash flow stability.
