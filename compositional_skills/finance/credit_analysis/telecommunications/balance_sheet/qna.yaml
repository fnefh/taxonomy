    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the composition and valuation of PP&E such as network
      infrastructure, transmission systems, and switching equipment. They must review
      asset age, condition, and technological relevance, along with capital expenditure
      trends and investments in network upgrades.

      indicators related to technological obsolescence.
