  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate service revenue in a telecom
      income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review revenue from voice, data, and broadband services,
      focusing on 

      ARPU trends and the mix of prepaid versus postpaid customers. They must assess the 

      impact of pricing strategies, competition, and customer churn on revenue stability.
  - question: |
      How can equipment sales revenue be assessed in a telecom income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine revenue from device and equipment sales,
      considering the 

      profitability of these sales and any subsidies offered. This analysis helps determine 

      the contribution of equipment sales to overall income.
  - question: >
      How should wholesale and interconnection revenue be analyzed in a
      telecom income 

      statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate revenue from providing network access to other
      operators, ISPs, 

      and corporate clients. They should consider the impact of regulatory changes and market 

      competition on these revenue streams.
  - question: |
      How should operating expenses be evaluated in a telecom income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review expenses related to network maintenance,
      interconnection fees, 

      and technology upgrades, along with SG&A expenses such as marketing and customer support. 

      Depreciation and amortization of capital assets should also be considered.
  - question: >
      Which profitability metrics are essential for evaluating a telecom
      income statement?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include EBITDA, operating income, and net income. Analysts
      should calculate 

      operating margins and track EPS trends over time, comparing these figures with industry peers 

      to assess operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      How should interest expense and leverage be analyzed in the
      telecommunications industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should calculate interest coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to
      Interest Expense, 

      to assess the company's ability to service its debt. High leverage relative to earnings 

      may signal increased financial risk.
  - question: >
      What role do customer churn and acquisition costs play in a telecom
      income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess customer churn rates and analyze customer
      acquisition costs (CAC) 

      to determine their impact on recurring revenue. High churn or rising CAC can erode 

      revenue stability and profitability.
  - question: >
      How should non-recurring items be treated in telecom income statement
      analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should isolate one-time charges such as restructuring costs,
      asset impairments, 

      or litigation settlements from recurring earnings. Adjusting for these items provides a 

      clearer view of the company's core operational performance.
