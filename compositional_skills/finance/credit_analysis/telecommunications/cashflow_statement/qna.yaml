  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a
      telecommunications company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash flows from core telecom operations by adjusting net
      income for non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization. They must analyze
      changes in working capital components including accounts receivable, accounts payable,
      and inventories, while considering the impact of customer payment terms and prepaid
      services on cash flow timing.
  - question: >
      What working capital factors are critical when analyzing operating cash flow for
      telecom companies?
    answer: >
      Key factors include the management of receivables from customers, the efficiency of
      billing and collection, and the timing of payments. Evaluating inventory levels and
      accounts payable terms is essential to understand cash conversion cycles.
  - question: >
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed in the telecommunications industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review cash outflows for capital expenditures on network infrastructure,
      technology upgrades, spectrum licenses, and expansion projects. They should assess
      CapEx relative to revenue and operating cash flow, and consider cash flows from asset
      sales and acquisitions.
  - question: >
      What are the key aspects to consider when evaluating financing cash flow in a telecom
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine cash inflows from debt and equity financing and outflows for
      debt repayments, share repurchases, and dividend payments. Evaluating the maturity
      profile of debt and refinancing risks is also crucial.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated, and why is it important for telecom companies?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash
      flow. It measures the company's ability to generate surplus cash for debt servicing,
      reinvestment, and shareholder returns, despite high CapEx requirements.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are essential for assessing a telecom company's cash flow
      health?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include cash and cash equivalents, the current ratio, and the
      quick ratio. Analysts should also evaluate access to credit facilities and the overall
      working capital management.
  - question: >
      How should debt service coverage be evaluated in a telecommunications company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must calculate ratios such as Operating Cash Flow to Interest Paid, and
      examine the debt maturity schedule to assess refinancing risks and the company's
      ability to service its debt.
  - question: >
      How can scenario analysis be used to assess cash flow sensitivity in the telecom
      industry?
    answer: >
      Scenario analysis should model the impact of changes in revenue, operating costs, and
      CapEx requirements on cash flow projections. Analysts must consider the company's
      ability to adjust expenditures in response to market conditions and technological
      shifts.
