  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the portfolio of investment
      properties,
      including commercial, residential, industrial, and retail assets?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the composition and valuation of investment
      properties by
      reviewing the methods used (cost model vs. fair value), frequency of revaluations,
      occupancy rates, lease terms, tenant quality, and geographic diversification.
  - question: |
      How should properties under development be analyzed on the balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review properties under construction, land holdings, and
      pre-sale or
      pre-lease agreements. They should assess development stages, expected completion
      dates, and risks such as cost overruns or market demand shifts.
  - question: >
      How should intangible assets, such as goodwill and brand equity, be
      evaluated in
      a real estate company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine goodwill from acquisitions and assess valuation
      of
      intangible assets like management contracts and trademarks. Evaluating impairment
      risks is crucial if acquired entities underperform.
  - question: >
      How can the debt structure and leverage of a real estate company be
      analyzed?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review short-term and long-term debt obligations,
      including mortgages,
      bonds, and loans. Calculating leverage ratios such as Loan-to-Value, Debt-to-
      Equity, and Debt-to-EBITDA, and assessing debt servicing ability amid market cycles
      are essential.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are critical when evaluating a real estate
      company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity metrics include the current ratio and quick ratio.
      Analysts should review
      working capital management by analyzing receivables from tenants, payables to
      suppliers, and the impact of property sales cycles on short-term liquidity.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet items be evaluated in the context of real
      estate?
    answer: >
      Analysts must identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating
      leases for
      retail spaces, warehouses, or equipment, as well as long-term purchase commitments
      and joint venture arrangements, to gauge their impact on future cash flows.
  - question: |
      How can asset valuation and impairment risks be analyzed for a real estate
      portfolio?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess sensitivity of property values to market
      conditions,
      interest rates, and economic cycles. Reviewing cap rate analysis and policies for
      recognizing impairments or write-downs is essential to understand reserve adequacy.
  - question: >
      What regulatory and compliance considerations are important in a real
      estate
      balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate compliance with zoning laws, environmental and
      safety
      regulations, and building codes. They should also review potential liabilities
      from regulatory non-compliance and assess risks from changes in industry policies.
