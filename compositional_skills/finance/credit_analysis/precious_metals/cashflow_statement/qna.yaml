  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a precious
      metals

      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash flows from core mining operations by
      adjusting net

      income for non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, depletion, amortization) and

      analyzing working capital changes. They must also gauge the sensitivity of

      cash flow to gold price fluctuations.
  - question: >
      What working capital components are critical in evaluating operating
      cash flow?
    answer: >
      Key components include accounts receivable from smelters, inventory
      levels,

      and accounts payable. Evaluating collection efficiency and credit terms is

      essential to understand cash flow dynamics.
  - question: >
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed in the precious metals industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review capital expenditures for mine development,
      equipment

      purchases, and exploration activities. They should distinguish between

      sustaining and growth CapEx and examine proceeds from asset sales or acquisitions.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing financing cash flow in this
      sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate cash inflows from debt issuance and equity
      financing,

      and outflows for debt repayments, share repurchases, and dividends, while

      considering debt maturity profiles and refinancing risks.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated and why is it important for
      this industry?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from
      operating

      cash flow. This metric indicates the company's ability to generate surplus cash

      for debt servicing, reinvestment, and shareholder returns.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures should be used to assess a company's cash reserves?
    answer: >
      Analysts should calculate liquidity ratios such as the current and quick
      ratios,

      and assess the adequacy of cash and cash equivalents, as well as access to credit

      facilities, to ensure short-term obligations are met.
  - question: >
      How should debt service coverage be evaluated in a precious metals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must calculate the ratio of operating cash flow to interest
      expense

      and review the debt maturity schedule to assess the company's ability to service

      its debt and manage refinancing risks.
  - question: >
      How can sensitivity analysis and financial flexibility be incorporated
      into 

      cash flow analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should perform scenario analysis to assess the impact of gold
      price

      fluctuations, production volume shifts, and changes in capital expenditures.

      This reveals the firm's ability to adjust spending and maintain cash flow.
