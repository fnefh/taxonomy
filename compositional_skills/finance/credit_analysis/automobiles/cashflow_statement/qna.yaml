  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in an
      automobile company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should review cash generated from core automotive operations
      by adjusting

      net income for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and by analyzing

      changes in working capital components like receivables, payables, and inventory.
  - question: >
      What is the impact of financing and leasing activities on operating
      cash flow?
    answer: >
      Analysts must consider cash flows from the financing arm, including the
      quality and

      collectability of receivables from leasing operations, as these affect overall cash

      flow timing and introduce potential credit risks.
  - question: |
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed for an automobile company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should assess cash outflows for CapEx on manufacturing
      facilities,

      equipment upgrades, and new technology development. It is important to distinguish

      between maintenance CapEx and growth CapEx aimed at expanding capacity.
  - question: >
      What financing cash flow factors are critical for evaluating an
      automobile company's

      financial health?
    answer: >
      Key factors include examining cash inflows from new debt issuance and
      outflows for debt

      repayments, as well as reviewing equity financing activities, dividend payments, and

      share repurchases to understand leverage and capital structure.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated and why is it important in the
      automobile

      industry?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from
      operating cash

      flow. This metric measures the surplus cash available for debt servicing, reinvestment,

      and shareholder returns, while FCF margins indicate operational efficiency.
  - question: |
      What liquidity metrics and working capital components should be analyzed?
    answer: >
      Analysts should calculate current and quick ratios to assess short-term
      liquidity.

      Additionally, evaluating cash reserves and the management of receivables, payables,

      and inventory levels is essential to ensure the company can meet its obligations.
  - question: >
      How can debt service coverage be evaluated in the context of the
      automobile industry?
    answer: >
      Evaluating the ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense, along
      with reviewing

      the debt maturity profile, helps determine the companyâ€™s ability to service its debt

      and manage refinancing risks.
  - question: >
      How does scenario analysis and capital allocation strategy affect cash
      flow sensitivity?
    answer: >
      Scenario analysis should assess the impact of changes in sales volumes,
      economic

      conditions, and commodity prices on cash flows. Reviewing management's capital

      allocation strategy also reveals the company's flexibility in adjusting production

      levels and cost structures in response to external shocks.
