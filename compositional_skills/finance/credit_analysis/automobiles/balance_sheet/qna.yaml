  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate capital assets and production
      facilities 

      in an automobile company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should assess the composition and valuation of manufacturing
      plants, 

      machinery, and equipment. They must consider the efficiency, modernity, and 

      technological relevance of production facilities, as these factors impact 

      production costs and competitiveness.
  - question: >
      What key factors must be considered when analyzing inventory levels on
      the 

      balance sheet of an automotive firm?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished
      goods. They 

      should calculate Day Sales Inventory and compare it to the industry benchmark of 

      60 days, noting that sustained high inventory levels may signal working capital 

      issues and potential write-downs.
  - question: |
      How should intangible assets be evaluated in the automobile industry?
    answer: >
      Intangible assets such as brand value, patents, proprietary
      technologies, and R&D 

      investments must be assessed. These assets contribute to competitive advantage and 

      can drive future revenue streams if managed effectively.
  - question: |
      What liabilities are critical when assessing the debt structure of an 
      automobile company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine both short-term and long-term debt obligations,
      including 

      interest rates, maturity profiles, and covenants. The debt-to-equity ratio is key for 

      comparing financial leverage to industry benchmarks.
  - question: >
      How do liquidity ratios and working capital management impact an
      automotive 

      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Liquidity ratios such as the current and quick ratios help determine the
      company's 

      ability to meet short-term obligations. In addition, efficient management of 

      receivables, payables, and inventory turnover is essential for maintaining smooth 

      cash flow.
  - question: >
      What role do solvency ratios, like the interest coverage ratio, play
      in evaluating 

      financial stability?
    answer: >
      Solvency ratios, including the debt-to-equity and interest coverage
      ratios, reveal 

      the companyâ€™s ability to service its debt. A robust interest coverage ratio indicates 

      that earnings sufficiently cover interest expenses, signaling lower financial risk.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet obligations, such as operating leases or
      special 

      purpose entities, be factored into the balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should identify any significant off-balance sheet financing
      arrangements 

      as these can obscure the true extent of financial commitments. Recognizing these 

      items is vital for an accurate assessment of risk and financial transparency.
