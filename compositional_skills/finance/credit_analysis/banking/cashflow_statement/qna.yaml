  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a bank's cash flow
      statement?
    answer: >
      The analyst should review cash generated from core banking operations, including net
      interest and fee income. Adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation and loan
      loss provisions must be made, and changes in operating assets and liabilities (loans,
      deposits, trading assets) should be analyzed to assess earnings quality.
  - question: >
      What key factors should be considered in the investing cash flow section of a bank's
      cash flow statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine cash flows used for investments in securities and for capital
      expenditures on technology and infrastructure. In addition, they should review cash
      inflows from asset sales, mergers, and acquisitions, as these impact long-term growth
      and liquidity.
  - question: >
      How should financing cash flows be analyzed in a bank's cash flow statement?
    answer: >
      The analysis should focus on funding activities such as cash inflows from deposits and
      debt issuance, and outflows for debt repayments. Equity transactions like share issuances,
      buybacks, and dividend payments should also be evaluated to determine their impact on
      the bank's capital structure.
  - question: >
      Which liquidity metrics are critical when assessing a bank's cash flow health?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include the level of cash and cash equivalents, as well as regulatory
      liquidity ratios like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Analysts should also review
      strategies for liquidity management, including access to credit facilities and central
      bank support.
  - question: |
      How is cash flow adequacy and stability evaluated in the banking industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should calculate ratios such as Operating Cash Flow to Total Liabilities and
      review historical trends. Stress testing under adverse economic scenarios helps assess
      the bank's ability to sustain cash flow amid market disruptions.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet activities be factored into a bank's cash flow analysis?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet exposures, such as contingent liabilities from loan commitments,
      letters of credit, and derivatives, must be identified and incorporated into risk
      assessments and liquidity planning to reveal the true financial risk.
  - question: >
      What regulatory considerations are essential when analyzing a bank's cash flow statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must verify that the bank complies with liquidity standards such as LCR and
      NSFR, and consider the impact of evolving regulatory requirements on funding sources
      and overall cash flow management.
