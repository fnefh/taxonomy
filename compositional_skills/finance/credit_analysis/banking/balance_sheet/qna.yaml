  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst assess asset quality in a bank's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      The analyst should evaluate the loan portfolio composition by type, such as commercial
      loans, consumer loans, mortgages, and credit cards. They should measure the
      proportion of non-performing loans and review loan loss reserves. Concentration risks
      by industry, geography, or borrower must also be assessed. Investment securities and
      the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) should be analyzed relative to risk.
  - question: >
      What capital adequacy metrics are essential for evaluating a bank's financial
      strength?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include the Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Total Capital Ratio, and Common Equity
      Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio. Analysts should also evaluate the leverage ratio, defined as
      Tier 1 Capital divided by Average Total Assets, and compare these to Basel III
      standards and industry benchmarks.
  - question: |
      How should funding and liquidity be analyzed in a bank's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine the stability and composition of the deposit base, including
      demand, savings, and time deposits. They should assess the cost of deposits and
      evaluate wholesale funding sources such as interbank loans or repurchase agreements.
      Liquidity ratios like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio
      (NSFR) are critical.
  - question: |
      How is asset-liability management (ALM) assessed in the banking sector?
    answer: >
      ALM analysis involves examining the mismatch between asset and liability maturities,
      evaluating the sensitivity of both to interest rate changes, and reviewing hedging
      strategies that use derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk.
  - question: >
      What off-balance sheet exposures should be considered when analyzing a bank's risk?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet items include contingent liabilities such as loan commitments,
      letters of credit, and guarantees. Analysts should also review exposures from
      derivatives and securitized assets to assess potential impacts on liquidity and risk.
  - question: >
      Which other considerations are important when evaluating a bank's balance sheet for
      credit analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should verify regulatory compliance with capital requirements and review
      the bank's risk management practices. This includes assessing internal controls for
      managing credit, market, and operational risks to ensure overall financial stability.
