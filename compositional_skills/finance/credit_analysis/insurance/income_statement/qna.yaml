  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate premium income in an insurance income
      statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review gross written, net written, and net earned premiums.
      They must assess trends in premium growth, retention rates, and the balance
      between new business and renewals, along with pricing strategies and
      underwriting standards.
  - question: |
      How should investment income be analyzed in the context of an insurance
      company's income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine income from interest, dividends, and both realized
      and unrealized gains or losses on investments. They must consider the
      volatility of investment returns and its contribution to overall profitability.
  - question: |
      How can fee and other income be assessed in an insurance company's income
      statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate revenue from asset management services, policy fees,
      and other non-premium sources. Understanding the diversification and
      sustainability of these income streams is crucial.
  - question: |
      What factors should be considered when evaluating claims and policyholder
      benefits?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review incurred claims, including reported and IBNR claims,
      and assess loss ratios by comparing claims incurred to net earned premiums.
      They should also evaluate policyholder benefit expenses and trends in policy
      surrenders.
  - question: >
      How should underwriting expenses, including acquisition costs, be analyzed?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine expenses such as commissions, broker fees, and the
      amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), along with SG&A and other
      operating costs, to measure efficiency via expense ratios.
  - question: |
      Which profitability metrics are essential for assessing an insurance
      company's performance?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, net income,
      ROE, and ROA. Analysts should track these ratios over time and compare them
      with industry benchmarks to evaluate operational efficiency.
  - question: |
      How does reinsurance affect the income statement of an insurance company?
    answer: |
      Analysts should review premiums ceded, recoveries received, and the cost
      of reinsurance arrangements. These factors affect net premiums, claims
      expenses, and overall risk exposure.
  - question: |
      How should investment performance and non-recurring items be evaluated in
      an insurance income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess investment yield and returns, considering both market
      value changes and the impact on earnings. Additionally, isolating one-time
      charges or gains—such as restructuring costs or asset sale gains—helps reveal
      core operational performance.
