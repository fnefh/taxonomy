  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate intangible assets for an internet
      portal company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess goodwill from acquisitions, brand value, and
      capitalized customer

      acquisition costs. They must review impairment testing and amortization policies for

      content, technology rights, and proprietary software.
  - question: >
      What aspects of PP&E should be analyzed in the balance sheet of an
      internet portal company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review investments in data centers, servers, and network
      infrastructure.

      They should assess asset age, condition, and scalability to support user growth.
  - question: >
      How can strategic investments and alliances be evaluated on the
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine investments in joint ventures, strategic
      partnerships, and

      equity-method investments. Evaluating the purpose and potential returns of these

      investments is key to understanding their impact on financial stability.
  - question: >
      What liability factors are critical when analyzing an internet portal
      company's balance

      sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate short- and long-term debt, including interest
      rates, maturity

      profiles, and covenants. They should also review accounts payable and deferred revenue

      from subscription services.
  - question: >
      How should shareholders' equity and the company's burn rate be
      assessed in this industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review changes in retained earnings, additional paid-in
      capital, and

      treasury stock. The burn rate, or cash consumption rate, is crucial to determine if

      cash reserves are sufficient until profitability is achieved.
  - question: >
      Which liquidity measures are most important for an internet portal company?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current and quick ratios, and the
      adequacy of cash

      and cash equivalents. Analysts must consider the company's access to capital markets

      amid high cash burn.
  - question: |
      How should off-balance sheet items be factored into the analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating
      leases and

      contingent liabilities from legal or regulatory risks, and assess their potential impact

      on future cash flows and financial flexibility.
  - question: >
      How can asset quality and impairment risks be evaluated for an
      internet portal company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess the potential impairment of intangible assets,
      including goodwill

      and technology rights, and evaluate the fair value of strategic investments to determine

      any write-down risks.
