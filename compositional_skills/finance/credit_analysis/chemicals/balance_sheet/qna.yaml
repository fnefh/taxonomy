  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate PP&E in a chemical company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the composition and valuation of PP&E, including chemical
      production facilities, manufacturing plants, equipment, and technology assets. They
      must assess asset age, condition, and technological relevance, and analyze CapEx trends
      and investments made for modernization and environmental compliance.
  - question: |
      How should intangible assets be assessed in the chemicals industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine intangible assets such as goodwill from acquisitions, and
      intellectual property including patents, licenses, and trademarks. They must review
      amortization policies, estimate the remaining useful life, and evaluate impairment risks.
  - question: >
      What factors must be considered when analyzing inventory in a chemical company?
    answer: >
      Inventory analysis should cover raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.
      Analysts must assess management practices, valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, weighted
      average), and the risks of obsolescence and commodity price fluctuations.
  - question: |
      How can accounts receivable be evaluated for a chemicals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to assess customer creditworthiness and examine the aging of receivables.
      They should review credit terms and calculate Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) to gauge
      collection efficiency, considering cyclical risks in end markets.
  - question: >
      What are the key considerations when analyzing debt structure and leverage in this
      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine both short- and long-term debt obligations, interest rates,
      maturity profiles, and covenants. Leverage ratios such as Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-
      EBITDA must be compared to industry benchmarks, and currency risks for foreign-
      denominated debt should be evaluated.
  - question: >
      How should environmental liabilities be incorporated into the balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review provisions for environmental remediation and compliance with
      environmental regulations. They should assess the adequacy of reserves for potential
      liabilities arising from pollution or hazardous waste and the overall financial impact.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are crucial for a chemical company's balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity metrics include the current and quick ratios. Analysts should evaluate
      working capital management by reviewing the management of receivables, payables, and
      inventory turnover, while considering cyclicality and commodity price volatility.
  - question: >
      Which regulatory and risk management factors should be examined in the chemicals
      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess compliance with environmental and health/safety regulations,
      including emission standards and chemical safety. They must also evaluate exposure to
      commodity and energy price fluctuations, currency risks, and the effectiveness of
      hedging strategies.
