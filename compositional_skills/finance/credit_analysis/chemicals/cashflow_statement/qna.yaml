  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a chemicals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash generated from core operations by adjusting net income
      for non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, impairments, and stock-based
      compensation. They must also analyze changes in working capital, including receivables,
      payables, and inventory, to gauge cash flow stability amid cyclical conditions.
  - question: >
      What key factors should be considered when analyzing investing cash flow in a
      chemicals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review capital expenditures for investments in manufacturing
      facilities, technology upgrades, capacity expansions, and environmental compliance.
      They must also consider cash flows from acquisitions, divestitures, and R&D
      investments that support long-term innovation.
  - question: >
      How can financing cash flow be evaluated in the context of a chemicals company?
    answer: >
      The analysis should focus on cash inflows from new debt issuance and outflows for debt
      repayments. It should also examine equity financing activities such as share issuances,
      repurchases, and dividend payments to assess the company's reliance on external
      financing and its impact on capital structure.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated, and why is it important for a chemicals firm?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash
      flow. This metric reflects the firm's ability to generate surplus cash to fund R&D,
      service debt, and return capital to shareholders despite working capital fluctuations.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are crucial in evaluating a chemicals company's cash flow
      health?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate the level of cash and cash equivalents, review available credit
      facilities and revolving credit agreements, and assess compliance with financial covenants
      to ensure the company can meet short-term obligations and unexpected expenses.
  - question: >
      How does cash flow sensitivity analysis help in understanding the risks faced by a
      chemicals company?
    answer: >
      Sensitivity analysis examines the impact of commodity price fluctuations, changes in demand,
      and foreign exchange movements on cash flows. This analysis helps determine the firm's
      ability to adjust expenditures and manage liquidity under varying market conditions.
  - question: >
      What role do hedging and derivatives play in managing cash flow risks in the
      chemicals industry?
    answer: >
      Hedging strategies and the use of derivatives are essential to mitigate risks arising from
      volatile raw material and energy prices as well as currency fluctuations. Evaluating these
      strategies provides insights into the stability of cash flows and the overall financial health.
