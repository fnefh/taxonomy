  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the aircraft fleet and capital assets in an
      airline balance sheet?
    answer: >
      The analyst should assess both owned and leased aircraft by considering fleet age,
      fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and technological advancements. Additional
      capital assets like airport facilities, equipment, and tech systems should also be
      evaluated.
  - question: >
      What key factors must be examined when analyzing intangible assets in the airline
      industry?
    answer: >
      Intangible assets include airport slots, gates, routes, and brand value. Analysts
      should evaluate how these assets contribute to competitive advantage and future
      revenue generation.
  - question: >
      How is Air Traffic Liability (ATL) considered in asset analysis for airlines?
    answer: >
      ATL represents money received for passenger tickets and cargo services that have
      not yet been provided. Analysts must adjust asset analysis to account for this
      unearned revenue.
  - question: >
      What debt structure factors are essential for evaluating an airline's liabilities?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review both short- and long-term debt, calculate leverage ratios such as
      Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-EBITDA, and assess the company's ability to service debt,
      especially during economic downturns.
  - question: >
      How do lease obligations and labor-related liabilities affect an airline's balance
      sheet?
    answer: >
      Lease obligations, including operating and capital leases for aircraft and equipment,
      can restrict financial flexibility. In addition, significant labor obligations such as
      pensions and post-retirement benefits add to fixed costs and impact overall stability.
  - question: >
      How should liquidity and working capital management be analyzed in the airline
      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should calculate liquidity ratios like the current and quick ratios, and then
      assess working capital components such as receivables, payables, and spare parts
      inventory to determine operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      What does fixed asset turnover indicate in an airline's balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Fixed asset turnover measures how effectively the company uses its aircraft and
      facilities to generate revenue. Higher turnover indicates efficient use of
      capital-intensive assets.
