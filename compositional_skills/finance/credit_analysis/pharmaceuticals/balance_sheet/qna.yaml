  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate R&D assets and intellectual
      property on the 

      balance sheet of a pharmaceuticals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the capitalization of R&D costs, patents,
      licenses, and 

      trademarks. They must assess amortization policies, useful life assumptions, and 

      potential impairment risks, and examine the drug pipeline for future earnings impact.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when analyzing goodwill and
      acquisitions in the 

      pharmaceuticals industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate goodwill arising from acquisitions of other firms
      or drug 

      portfolios, and assess impairment risks if acquired products underperform or market 

      conditions deteriorate.
  - question: |
      How should PP&E be analyzed in a pharmaceuticals company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review investments in manufacturing facilities,
      laboratories, and 

      equipment. They must assess asset age, condition, and modernization efforts to meet 

      regulatory standards and production demands.
  - question: >
      What is the importance of analyzing inventory in the pharmaceuticals
      sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to examine inventory levels of raw materials,
      work-in-progress, and 

      finished drugs. Evaluating turnover ratios and valuation methods (e.g., FIFO, LIFO) 

      is key to managing obsolescence risks and demand fluctuations.
  - question: |
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the debt structure and leverage of a 
      pharmaceuticals company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess short- and long-term debt, reviewing interest
      rates, maturity 

      profiles, and covenants. Calculating leverage ratios like Debt-to-Equity and 

      Debt-to-EBITDA, and evaluating the companyâ€™s ability to service debt is essential.
  - question: >
      What aspects of shareholders' equity and capital structure should be
      analyzed?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine changes in retained earnings, accumulated other 

      comprehensive income, and treasury stock. They must review dividend policies, 

      stock issuances, and repurchase programs to evaluate capital strength.
  - question: >
      Which liquidity and working capital measures are critical in the
      pharmaceuticals 

      industry?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity metrics include the current and quick ratios. Analysts
      should review 

      working capital management by analyzing receivables, payables, and inventory levels,

      especially given high R&D and production costs.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet items and regulatory factors be evaluated
      in this 

      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating
      leases and 

      contingent liabilities from legal or regulatory disputes. They should assess 

      compliance with FDA, EMA, and other regulatory bodies, including the impact of patent 

      expirations on future revenue.
