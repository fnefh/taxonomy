  - question: >
      How should R&D investments be evaluated on a biotech company's balance
      sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the proportion of assets allocated to R&D and
      consider the 

      potential for innovation alongside the risks if projects fail to yield commercial 

      products. Reviewing trends in R&D spending and possible write-offs is crucial.
  - question: |
      How should intangible assets be analyzed for a biotech firm?
    answer: >
      Intangible assets, including patents, licenses, and proprietary
      technologies, are 

      key drivers of value. Analysts must evaluate their legal protection, amortization 

      policies, and potential impairment risks to determine their impact on credit risk.
  - question: |
      Why are cash reserves and liquidity critical for biotech companies?
    answer: >
      Given the long R&D phases and delayed revenue generation, sufficient
      cash reserves 

      and liquidity are essential to sustain operations and fund innovation without 

      excessive reliance on external financing.
  - question: >
      How should debt levels and structure be assessed in the context of a
      biotech company?
    answer: >
      Since biotech firms generally rely more on equity than debt, any
      existing debt 

      should be scrutinized for interest rates, maturity profiles, and terms to ensure 

      manageable obligations despite limited revenues.
  - question: >
      What are the implications of contingent liabilities on a biotech
      firm's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Contingent liabilities from clinical trials, regulatory issues, or IP
      disputes may 

      pose significant risks. Analysts must estimate their potential impact and factor these 

      liabilities into the overall assessment of financial stability.
  - question: >
      How should shareholder equity and financing needs be evaluated in the
      biotech sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine the equity base to gauge the firmâ€™s ability to
      attract further 

      investment for long-term R&D projects. A heavy reliance on additional equity financing 

      may indicate underlying financial vulnerability.
  - question: >
      What overall insights can be drawn from a biotech firm's balance sheet
      analysis?
    answer: >
      A comprehensive analysis should balance high R&D investments and
      valuable intangible 

      assets against liquidity levels, limited debt, and contingent liabilities. These factors 

      collectively reflect the firm's financial stability and credit risk.
