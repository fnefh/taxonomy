  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a transportation
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the ability to generate cash from core operations by
      adjusting net income for non-cash expenses (e.g., depreciation, amortization,
      impairments, stock-based compensation). They must analyze working capital
      changes—including receivables, payables, and accrued expenses—and consider the
      impact of seasonality and economic cycles.
  - question: >
      What working capital components are critical for evaluating operating cash flow
      in the transportation sector?
    answer: >
      Key components include accounts receivable from customers, accounts payable to
      suppliers, and accrued expenses. Analysts should evaluate credit policies,
      collection efficiency, and supplier payment terms to gauge cash flow timing.
  - question: >
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed in a transportation and logistics
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review cash outflows for capital expenditures on equipment,
      technology upgrades, terminals, warehouses, and infrastructure. They should
      also examine cash flows from asset sales, acquisitions, divestitures, and
      investments in logistics technology.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when evaluating financing cash flow in the
      transportation industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine cash inflows from new borrowings and equity financing,
      along with outflows for debt repayments, share repurchases, dividend payments,
      and lease payments. The maturity profile of debt, refinancing risks, and interest
      rate exposure are critical factors.
  - question: |
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated, and why is it important for a
      transportation company?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating
      cash flow. It measures the company's ability to generate surplus cash for debt
      servicing, reinvestment, and shareholder returns.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are essential for assessing a transportation company's
      financial flexibility?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include cash and cash equivalents, the current ratio, and
      the quick ratio. Analysts should also assess working capital management and
      available credit facilities.
  - question: >
      How should cash flow sensitivity analysis be performed in the transportation
      sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts should conduct scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in
      fuel prices, freight rates, and demand on cash flow projections. They must assess
      the company's ability to adjust expenditures and manage cash flows in response to
      market conditions.
  - question: >
      How can risk management activities, such as hedging, be integrated into cash flow
      analysis for a transportation company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review hedging strategies for managing fuel price and foreign
      exchange risks. Evaluating the effectiveness of derivatives, insurance policies,
      and contingency plans helps stabilize cash flows and mitigate financial risks.
