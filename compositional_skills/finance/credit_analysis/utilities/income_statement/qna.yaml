  - question: >
      How do you differentiate between regulated and unregulated revenue streams in
      a utilities income statement?
    answer: >
      Regulated revenue is derived from operations such as transmission and
      distribution under regulatory oversight, making it stable and predictable.
      Unregulated revenue, such as from merchant power generation or energy trading,
      is more volatile.
  - question: >
      What role does customer segmentation play in analyzing a utilities company's
      income statement?
    answer: >
      Customer segmentation breaks down revenue by customer classes like residential,
      commercial, and industrial. This analysis helps assess the impact of demand
      fluctuations and economic conditions on revenue stability.
  - question: >
      How should operating expenses be analyzed in the income statement of a utilities
      company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should focus on fuel and purchased power costs, operations and
      maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Evaluating the impact of fuel price
      volatility and cost control measures is also critical.
  - question: >
      Which profitability metrics are crucial for evaluating a utilities company's
      performance?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include operating income, operating margin, and EBIT. These reflect
      the company's core operational efficiency and are influenced by regulatory rate
      cases and allowed returns.
  - question: >
      How does the company's interest expense and debt structure affect its income
      statement analysis?
    answer: >
      A high interest expense relative to EBIT may indicate financial strain. Evaluating
      interest coverage ratios and analyzing the maturity and structure of debt are
      essential to assess the company's ability to service its obligations.
  - question: >
      What impact do regulatory rate cases and cost recovery clauses have on a utilities
      company's income statement?
    answer: >
      Regulatory rate cases can lead to approved rate increases and adjustments to
      allowed returns, which directly influence revenue and profitability. Cost
      recovery clauses help stabilize income by allowing certain costs to be passed
      through to customers.
  - question: >
      How are environmental compliance costs reflected in a utilities company's income
      statement?
    answer: >
      Expenses for emission controls and investments in renewable energy are included
      in operating expenses. Although these costs reduce margins, regulatory mechanisms
      may allow partial recovery of these expenses.
