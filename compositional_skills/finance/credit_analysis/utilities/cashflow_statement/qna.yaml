  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the operating cash flow in a
      utilities company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should review cash flows from core operating activities and
      adjust for 

      non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. They should also analyze 

      changes in working capital components like accounts receivable, accounts payable, 

      and regulatory assets. Seasonal demand fluctuations and fuel cost pass-through timing 

      must be considered.
  - question: >
      What factors should be examined when analyzing investing cash flows,
      particularly 

      capital expenditures, in the utilities sector?
    answer: >
      The analyst must examine cash outflows for infrastructure investments,
      including 

      maintenance, upgrades, and expansion projects. It is essential to compare CapEx 

      relative to both depreciation expense and operating cash flow, and to ensure that 

      investment plans align with regulatory approvals and future demand forecasts.
  - question: >
      Which aspects of financing cash flow are critical for assessing a
      utilities company's 

      financial flexibility and debt servicing capacity?
    answer: >
      Key aspects include analyzing cash inflows from new borrowings and
      outflows for debt 

      repayments, assessing the maturity profile and interest structure of the debt, and 

      reviewing equity financing activities such as share issuances and repurchases. The 

      sustainability of dividend payments should also be evaluated.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated in this context, and why is it
      important for 

      credit analysis in utilities?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from
      operating cash 

      flow. This measure reflects the company's ability to generate surplus cash for debt 

      servicing, reinvestment, and shareholder returns, which is particularly important in 

      a capital-intensive, regulated industry.
  - question: >
      What elements should be considered in a cash flow sensitivity analysis
      for a utilities 

      company?
    answer: >
      The analysis should assess the impact of changes in operating
      conditions, regulatory 

      decisions, fuel prices, and capital expenditure requirements on cash flow projections. 

      It should also consider the company's ability to adjust expenditures and maintain liquidity 

      through available credit facilities and compliance with financial covenants.
