  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the composition and valuation of
      PP&E in a

      construction and engineering company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review PP&E by examining heavy machinery, equipment,
      vehicles, and

      technology assets. They must assess asset age, condition, and utilization rates, and

      analyze capital expenditure trends to determine investments for maintenance or expansion.
  - question: >
      How should intangible assets be analyzed in the construction and
      engineering sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine intangible assets such as goodwill from
      acquisitions and

      intellectual property including patents and licenses. They must evaluate amortization

      policies and potential impairment risks to determine the impact on competitive advantage.
  - question: >
      What aspects of accounts receivable and unbilled revenue should be
      considered in a

      construction and engineering balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to review the aging of receivables from clients, including
      government and

      private sector customers, and assess unbilled revenue from work completed but not yet

      invoiced, considering percentage-of-completion accounting.
  - question: >
      What key factors should be evaluated when analyzing a company's debt
      structure and

      leverage?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess both short-term and long-term debt, including
      interest rates,

      maturity profiles, and covenants. Leverage ratios such as Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-EBITDA,

      as well as currency risks on foreign-denominated debt, are critical for evaluating financial risk.
  - question: >
      How can liquidity and working capital management be assessed in the
      construction and

      engineering industry?
    answer: >
      Evaluating liquidity involves calculating the current and quick ratios
      and analyzing working

      capital components. Analysts should review receivables, payables, inventory turnover, and cash

      tied up in projects, including retention monies withheld by clients.
  - question: >
      How do off-balance sheet items affect the financial risk of a
      construction and

      engineering company?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet items such as operating leases, joint ventures, and
      contingent liabilities

      (including performance bonds and guarantees) must be identified and analyzed, as they can impact

      future cash flows and overall financial flexibility.
  - question: >
      How should risk management and regulatory compliance be incorporated
      into the balance

      sheet analysis of a construction and engineering company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate project risk exposure by examining client
      concentration, geographic

      distribution, and project types. Additionally, they must assess compliance with environmental,

      safety, and licensing regulations, and review potential liabilities from litigation or regulatory

      actions to gauge overall risk and financial stability.
