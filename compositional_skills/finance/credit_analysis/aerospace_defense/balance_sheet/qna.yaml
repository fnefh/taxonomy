  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the composition and valuation of
      PP&E in an

      aerospace and defense company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should segment PP&E into manufacturing facilities,
      specialized 

      equipment, and technology assets. Key steps include assessing asset age, 

      condition, and technological relevance, as well as reviewing capital expenditure 

      trends for upgrades or expansions.
  - question: >
      What factors are critical when analyzing intangible assets such as
      goodwill and 

      intellectual property in this industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine goodwill arising from acquisitions for potential 

      impairment risks and review intangible assets such as patents and design rights. 

      Evaluating amortization policies and the remaining useful life of these assets is 

      essential.
  - question: >
      How is inventory management assessed in an aerospace and defense
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Inventory analysis should consider raw materials, work-in-progress, and
      finished 

      goods. Analysts assess inventory levels in light of long production cycles and the 

      risk of obsolescence due to rapid technological change or contract cancellations.
  - question: >
      Which debt metrics and qualitative factors are important when
      evaluating liabilities 

      in this industry?
    answer: >
      Critical metrics include Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-EBITDA ratios.
      Analysts should 

      also review maturity profiles, interest rate exposure (fixed versus variable), and 

      any restrictive covenants, especially given the reliance on government contracts 

      for cash flow stability.
  - question: >
      How do off-balance sheet items, such as operating leases and
      contingent liabilities, 

      affect the balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet items can conceal significant financial commitments,
      including 

      facility leases and purchase commitments. Analysts must adjust liquidity and 

      leverage assessments by incorporating these potential future cash outflows.
  - question: >
      What contractual and regulatory factors must be considered in this
      balance sheet 

      analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate the order backlog, government contracts, and
      cost 

      recovery clauses. Regulatory compliance, export controls, and the impact of defense 

      budgets on revenue are also key factors that influence both risk and stability.
  - question: >
      How should liquidity and working capital be analyzed in an aerospace
      and defense 

      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Liquidity analysis should include current and quick ratios, alongside a
      detailed 

      review of working capital management. This involves examining the timing of 

      customer payments and the impact of long production cycles on short-term obligations.
  - question: >
      What risk management factors, such as currency and commodity exposure,
      should be 

      incorporated into the analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts must assess exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and
      commodity 

      price risks (e.g., aluminum, titanium). Evaluating the effectiveness of hedging 

      strategies and considering technological and cybersecurity risks are also important.
  - question: >
      How should pension obligations and other post-employment benefits be
      evaluated 

      for aerospace and defense companies?
    answer: >
      Analysis should focus on unfunded pension liabilities, which can be
      substantial 

      due to large workforces and legacy costs. Key considerations include:

      - Funded status of pension plans and trajectory

      - Impact on cash flow requirements and debt-like characteristics

      - Sensitivity to discount rate assumptions and investment returns

      - Potential for pension freezes or benefit modifications
  - question: >
      What are the key considerations when analyzing capitalized R&D and
      program 

      development costs on the balance sheet?
    answer: |
      Analysts should evaluate:
      - Capitalization policies and amortization schedules
      - Success rate of past programs and potential for write-offs
      - Ratio of capitalized to expensed R&D costs
      - Recovery mechanisms through contract pricing
      - Impact on profitability metrics when costs are amortized
  - question: >
      How should progress payments and customer advances be assessed in the
      working 

      capital analysis?
    answer: |
      Analysis should consider:
      - Size and timing of progress payments relative to program milestones
      - Impact on working capital needs and cash conversion cycle
      - Risk of repayment if programs are cancelled or delayed
      - Terms and conditions of major contracts regarding payment timing
      - Historical patterns of payment receipts and program execution
