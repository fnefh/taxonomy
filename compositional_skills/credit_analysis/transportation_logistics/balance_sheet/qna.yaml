  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the asset composition of a transportation
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review PP&E such as trucks, ships, airplanes, railcars, warehouses,
      terminals, and handling equipment. They must assess valuation methods, asset age,
      condition, and technological relevance, while considering geographic risks and
      environmental factors.
  - question: >
      How can leased assets and off-balance sheet items affect the balance sheet in the
      transportation industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine operating and finance leases for equipment and facilities,
      especially under IFRS 16 or ASC 842. They must evaluate the impact of these items on
      cash flows and financial flexibility.
  - question: |
      What key factors should be considered when analyzing liabilities in the
      transportation and logistics sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate short- and long-term debt, including bank loans, bonds, and
      lease liabilities. They should calculate leverage ratios like Debt-to-Equity and
      Debt-to-EBITDA, and review deferred revenue, customer deposits, and environmental or
      legal liabilities.
  - question: >
      How should shareholders' equity and capital structure be assessed in a transportation
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should analyze changes in retained earnings, accumulated other
      comprehensive income, and treasury stock. They must assess equity financing, share
      repurchase programs, and any minority interests in joint ventures or partnerships.
  - question: >
      Which liquidity ratios and working capital metrics are crucial for evaluating a
      transportation company's financial health?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current ratio and quick ratio. Analysts should also
      analyze working capital management through the cash conversion cycle (DIO, DSO, DPO)
      to assess operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet items and contingent liabilities be evaluated in the
      transportation sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts must identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating leases or SPEs
      and review contingent liabilities arising from legal disputes, environmental issues,
      or construction defects, to determine their impact on future cash flows.
  - question: >
      What risk management factors should be considered on a transportation company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate exposure to fuel price volatility, currency fluctuations,
      and environmental liabilities. Effective fleet management, supplier relationships,
      and hedging strategies are critical to mitigating these risks.
  - question: >
      What overall insights can be drawn from a comprehensive balance sheet analysis
      in the transportation and logistics industry?
    answer: >
      A holistic analysis integrates asset quality, debt management, and liquidity measures
      with off-balance sheet exposures and risk management practices. This approach helps
      identify strengths and risks, such as high leverage or significant lease obligations,
      that affect the company's creditworthiness.
