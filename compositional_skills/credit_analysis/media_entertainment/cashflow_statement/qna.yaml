  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a media company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash flows from core operations, including revenue from
      advertising, content licensing, and subscription services. They must adjust for
      non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization of content assets, impairments,
      and stock-based compensation, while also analyzing changes in working capital.
  - question: >
      What working capital components are critical when evaluating operating cash flow?
    answer: >
      Key components include accounts receivable from advertisers, distributors,
      and subscribers, as well as content production costs, accounts payable, and
      deferred revenue from licensing deals. Evaluating collection efficiency and
      payment timing is essential.
  - question: |
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed for an internet portal company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review cash outflows for capital expenditures on technology
      infrastructure, data centers, software development, and equipment upgrades.
      They should also examine cash used for acquisitions of content rights or strategic
      investments in digital platforms.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing financing cash flow in the media
      industry?
    answer: >
      The analysis should include cash inflows from debt or equity financing and outflows
      for debt repayments, share repurchases, and dividend payments. Analysts must
      consider debt maturity profiles and potential refinancing risks.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated for an internet portal company, and why is
      it important?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures and content
      investments from operating cash flow. This metric indicates the firm's ability to
      fund growth, service debt, and return capital to shareholders.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are critical for an internet portal company's cash flow
      health?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate cash and cash equivalents, current and quick ratios,
      and the availability of credit facilities. They must also assess the cash runway
      relative to the company's burn rate.
  - question: >
      How should cash flow sensitivity analysis be performed in the media industry?
    answer: >
      Sensitivity analysis should model the impact of changes in content performance,
      advertising revenue, subscriber growth, operating costs, and capital expenditures.
      This helps determine the firm's ability to adjust spending amid market shifts.
  - question: >
      What risk management activities are essential for stabilizing cash flows in a
      media and entertainment company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate hedging strategies and the use of derivatives for managing
      currency, interest rate, and commodity price risks. Assessing these measures is
      key to mitigating volatility in cash flows.
