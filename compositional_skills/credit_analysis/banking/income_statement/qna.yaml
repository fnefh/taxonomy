  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate net interest income (NII) in a bank's income
      statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts calculate NII by subtracting interest expense from interest income.
      They must review components of interest income from loans and securities and
      assess interest expense from deposits and borrowings to gauge overall profitability.
  - question: |
      What is net interest margin (NIM) and how is it evaluated?
    answer: >
      NIM is calculated as Net Interest Income divided by Average Earning Assets.
      Analysts should examine trends over time, compare with industry averages, and
      assess how changes in interest rates affect NIM and overall profitability.
  - question: >
      How should non-interest income be assessed in a bank's income statement analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts review fee-based revenue from account and transaction fees, as well as
      gains or losses from trading and investment activities, to evaluate revenue
      diversification and sustainability.
  - question: >
      How are credit loss provisions analyzed and what is their impact on earnings?
    answer: >
      Analysts compare provisions for loan losses to actual charge-offs to assess the
      adequacy of the allowance (ALLL) relative to credit risk. These provisions can
      significantly affect net income and overall profitability.
  - question: >
      What operating expense metrics are key for evaluating cost management in banks?
    answer: >
      Key metrics include personnel, occupancy, and technology expenses. The Efficiency
      Ratio—Non-Interest Expenses divided by the sum of Net Interest and Non-Interest
      Income—is critical for assessing cost control and operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      Which profitability metrics should be analyzed to assess a bank's performance?
    answer: >
      Analysts focus on Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Earnings Per
      Share (EPS). These ratios reveal how effectively the bank utilizes its assets and
      capital to generate profits.
  - question: |
      How does interest rate sensitivity affect a bank's income statement?
    answer: >
      Changes in interest rates impact net interest income. Analysts should review the
      bank's asset and liability management, including hedging strategies, to understand
      the effects on earnings.
  - question: |
      How should non-recurring items be treated in income statement analysis?
    answer: >
      Non-recurring items, such as one-time gains or losses from asset sales, restructuring,
      or impairments, must be isolated from core operating performance to provide a clearer
      picture of sustainable earnings.
