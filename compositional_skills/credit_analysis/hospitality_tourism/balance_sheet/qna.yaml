  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate PP&E in a hospitality and tourism
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the composition and valuation of properties such
      as hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other facilities. They must assess asset age, condition, and
      location, and analyze capital expenditure trends for maintenance, renovations, or
      expansions to enhance guest experiences and operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing intangible assets in the
      hospitality sector?
    answer: >
      Key intangible assets include goodwill from acquisitions and brand
      equity from trademarks and franchise agreements. Analysts should evaluate valuation methods,
      amortization policies, and potential impairment risks that affect competitive
      advantage and revenue generation.
  - question: >
      How should inventory be evaluated on the balance sheet of a
      hospitality company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review inventory levels of food and beverage supplies,
      amenities, and other operational items. They must assess management practices, seasonal
      build-ups, perishability risks, and the impact of valuation methods (e.g., FIFO,
      LIFO, weighted average) on financial statements.
  - question: >
      How can accounts receivable be assessed for a hospitality and tourism
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should analyze the quality and aging of receivables from
      retailers, distributors, and service contracts. Evaluating credit terms, collection efficiency,
      and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is essential to determine receivables risk.
  - question: >
      What liability factors must be considered when evaluating a hospitality company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to examine short- and long-term debt obligations, including interest
      rates, maturity profiles, covenants, and the mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.
      They should also review accounts payable, deferred revenue from group bookings or
      events, and any contingent liabilities arising from legal or regulatory issues.
  - question: >
      How should liquidity and working capital management be assessed in
      this industry?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current and quick ratios and the adequacy of cash
      reserves to meet short-term obligations. Analysts should review working capital
      management, particularly the impact of seasonal occupancy and sales cycles on receivables,
      payables, and inventory.
  - question: >
      How do off-balance sheet items impact the analysis of a hospitality company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Off-balance sheet items such as operating leases for retail spaces, warehouses, or
      equipment, as well as joint ventures and strategic partnerships, must be identified.
      Their potential impact on future cash flows and financial flexibility should be
      carefully evaluated.
  - question: >
      What risk management and regulatory factors should be considered in the hospitality
      and tourism industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate exposure to currency and foreign exchange risks for
      international operations and consider economic risks from market downturns.
      Additionally, compliance with health, safety, and labor regulations, along with
      environmental obligations and potential legal liabilities, is critical for assessing
      overall financial stability.
