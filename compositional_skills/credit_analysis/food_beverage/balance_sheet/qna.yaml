  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate inventory management in a Food and
      Beverage company?
    answer: >
      The analyst should examine the levels and composition of inventory, including raw
      materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. They must assess turnover ratios,
      evaluate the risk of obsolescence due to perishability and seasonal fluctuations,
      and analyze the impact of valuation methods such as FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average cost.
  - question: >
      How should PP&E be analyzed in the Food and Beverage industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review investments in production facilities, processing plants,
      warehouses, and distribution centers. They should assess asset age, condition, and
      modernization, ensuring compliance with food safety standards, and evaluate CapEx
      trends and expansion plans.
  - question: >
      What aspects of intangible assets are critical for a Food and Beverage
      company?
    answer: >
      Key intangible assets include brand equity, trademarks, and goodwill from acquisitions.
      Analysts should evaluate the valuation of these assets, the company's investment in brand
      development and protection, and potential impairment risks due to market or reputational
      issues.
  - question: >
      How should accounts receivable be evaluated on the balance sheet of a Food
      and Beverage company?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to assess the quality and aging of receivables from retailers, distributors,
      and foodservice customers. Evaluating credit terms and calculating Days Sales Outstanding
      (DSO) are essential to gauge collection efficiency and potential payment delays.
  - question: >
      What key factors must be considered when analyzing the debt structure of a
      Food and Beverage company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review both short- and long-term debt obligations, including interest rates,
      maturity profiles, covenants, and the mix of fixed versus variable-rate debt. Leverage ratios
      such as Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-EBITDA must be compared with industry benchmarks, while
      considering commodity price volatility.
  - question: >
      How can liquidity and working capital management be assessed in the Food
      and Beverage industry?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current and quick ratios. Analysts must analyze the
      management of receivables, payables, and inventory, and consider the impact of seasonal
      sales fluctuations and inventory build-up on the company's cash flow.
  - question: >
      What off-balance sheet items are relevant for a Food and Beverage company,
      and how should they be evaluated?
    answer: >
      Analysts should identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating leases for
      retail spaces, warehouses, or equipment, as well as long-term purchase commitments for
      raw materials. Evaluating these items helps determine their potential impact on future
      cash flows and financial flexibility.
  - question: >
      How should currency and commodity exposures, along with regulatory compliance,
      be assessed on the balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on assets and
      liabilities and assess hedging strategies. They should also consider commodity price risks
      for inputs like sugar, grains, dairy, coffee, or cocoa, and review compliance with food
      safety, quality, and environmental regulations.
