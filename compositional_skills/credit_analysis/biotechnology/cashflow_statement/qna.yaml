  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate net cash from operations in a biotech
      cash flow statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess the cash generated from core operations, noting that
      many biotech companies report negative operating cash flow due to high R&D
      spending. They must determine if cash flow is bolstered by non-recurring
      milestone payments or licensing revenue.
  - question: |
      How do changes in working capital affect a biotech company's cash flow?
    answer: |
      Analysts should review variations in accounts receivable and payable to
      identify liquidity fluctuations. These changes may indicate issues with
      collection efficiency or payment delays that affect overall cash flow.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when analyzing capital expenditures (CapEx)
      in biotech cash flow statements?
    answer: >
      CapEx analysis involves reviewing investments in facilities, laboratory
      equipment, and technology infrastructure. It is important to assess whether
      CapEx spending aligns with R&D and manufacturing goals.
  - question: |
      How do acquisitions and divestitures impact the investing cash flow of a
      biotech firm?
    answer: >
      Cash flows from acquiring or divesting technologies, subsidiaries, or IP
      assets can affect cash flow stability and future revenue potential. Analysts
      should evaluate these transactions to gauge their long-term impact.
  - question: |
      How should financing cash flows be evaluated in the biotech sector?
    answer: >
      Given the high R&D risks, biotech firms often rely on equity financing.
      Analysts should assess the frequency of new equity issuances, the potential
      dilution of shareholders, and any existing debt financing and repayments.
  - question: >
      What is the significance of free cash flow (FCF) in a biotech company's cash
      flow analysis?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting CapEx from operating cash flow.
      It indicates the firm's ability to fund additional R&D and expansion without
      relying on external financing, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.
  - question: >
      What liquidity risks are unique to biotech companies as reflected in their
      cash flow statements?
    answer: >
      Due to high cash burn from R&D and clinical trials, biotech firms must maintain
      robust cash reserves. Analysts should evaluate liquidity metrics and the cash
      burn rate to identify potential funding risks during extended development phases.
