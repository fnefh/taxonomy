  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate revenue from product sales and licensing in a
      biotech income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts should differentiate revenue derived from direct product sales versus
      licensing agreements and partnerships. Early-stage biotech firms may rely on
      licensing revenue before products are fully commercialized, so assessing the quality
      and sustainability of these revenue streams is essential.
  - question: >
      What is the significance of milestone and orphan drug revenue for a biotech company?
    answer: >
      Milestone payments and orphan drug revenues can provide a steady, though limited,
      cash flow. Analysts must determine how these non-recurring revenue sources contribute
      to overall income and affect credit risk.
  - question: >
      How should R&D expenditures be analyzed in the income statement of a biotech firm?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine both the trend and the percentage of revenue allocated to
      R&D. High R&D spending is critical for innovation but can strain cash reserves during
      long development phases if not managed effectively.
  - question: >
      What factors should be considered when evaluating SG&A expenses in the biotech sector?
    answer: >
      SG&A expenses, including marketing, administrative costs, and expenses related to
      new product launches, should be analyzed relative to revenue. High SG&A costs may
      signal inefficiencies or overinvestment that could pressure profitability.
  - question: >
      How do gross, operating, and net profit margins provide insight into a biotech
      company's performance?
    answer: >
      Gross margin indicates production and pricing efficiency, while operating and net
      profit margins reveal the company's ability to cover operating costs and achieve profit.
      In biotech, low or negative margins during early R&D phases may signal reliance on external funding.
  - question: >
      How should non-operating items, such as interest income/expense and gains from asset
      sales, be evaluated in a biotech income statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to isolate non-operating items to assess core earnings. High interest
      expenses or significant gains/losses from asset sales can distort profitability and must
      be adjusted for a true picture of operational performance.
  - question: >
      How do the income statement components collectively reflect a biotech firm's financial
      health and credit risk?
    answer: >
      By analyzing revenue composition, R&D and SG&A expenditures, profit margins, and
      non-operating items, analysts can assess the firm's operational efficiency and its
      ability to generate consistent earnings. Key risks include high R&D costs and heavy
      reliance on external funding.
