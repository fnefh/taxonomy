  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate the investment portfolio on an
      insurance
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the composition and quality of investments,
      including bonds,
      equities, real estate, and alternative assets. They must assess credit quality,
      liquidity, and maturity profiles to understand market, credit, and interest rate risks.
  - question: >
      How should reinsurance recoverables and deferred acquisition costs
      (DAC) be assessed?
    answer: >
      Analysts must examine amounts due from reinsurers and review DAC
      policies. They should
      verify that assumptions align with industry practices and assess potential risks if
      counterparties fail to meet their obligations.
  - question: >
      What liability factors are critical in evaluating an insurance
      company's balance
      sheet?
    answer: >
      Key liabilities include policyholder reserves, unearned premiums, and
      debt obligations.
      Analysts should assess the adequacy of loss reserves using actuarial assumptions,
      evaluate unearned premium reserves, and calculate leverage ratios like Debt-to-
      Equity.
  - question: |
      How is capital adequacy and solvency evaluated for an insurance firm?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review shareholders' equity or policyholders' surplus
      and compare
      regulatory capital ratios, such as RBC or Solvency II, with industry benchmarks.
      This assessment indicates the firm's ability to absorb unexpected losses.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures should be considered when analyzing an
      insurance company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate liquid assets such as cash, cash equivalents, and
      highly liquid
      investments. They should also consider the timing mismatch between premium inflows
      and claims outflows to assess overall liquidity.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet items be analyzed in the context of an
      insurance
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review reinsurance arrangements and contingent
      liabilities,
      including guarantees or legal commitments. Understanding these items is critical to
      assess their potential impact on future cash flows and financial flexibility.
  - question: >
      How is asset-liability management (ALM) evaluated in the insurance
      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine the matching of asset durations with liability
      durations
      to manage interest rate risk. Sensitivity analysis can help assess the impact of
      rate changes and market conditions on the balance sheet.
  - question: >
      What additional factors, such as credit ratings and regulatory
      compliance, should be
      considered in an insurance balance sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review credit ratings from agencies like A.M. Best,
      Standard & Poor's,
      and Moody's, and ensure compliance with statutory accounting principles and regulatory
      requirements to gauge the company's financial strength and risk exposure.
