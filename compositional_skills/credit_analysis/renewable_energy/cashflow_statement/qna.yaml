  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate operating cash flow in a renewable energy
      company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should assess cash flows from core renewable energy operations by
      adjusting net income for non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization,
      impairments, and stock-based compensation. They must also analyze changes in
      working capital, including receivables from PPAs and deferred revenue from service
      contracts.
  - question: >
      What working capital components are critical for analyzing operating cash flow
      in this industry?
    answer: >
      Key components include accounts receivable from utilities and government entities,
      deferred revenue from PPAs, and accounts payable to suppliers. Evaluating collection
      efficiency and billing practices is essential.
  - question: >
      How should investing cash flow be analyzed in a renewable energy company's cash
      flow statement?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review cash outflows for capital expenditures on renewable projects,
      such as solar farms, wind parks, hydroelectric facilities, and energy storage systems.
      They should assess CapEx relative to depreciation and operating cash flow, and examine
      cash flows from acquisitions or divestitures.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing financing cash flow in the renewable
      energy industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate cash inflows from debt issuance and equity financing, and
      outflows for debt repayments, share repurchases, and dividends. The maturity profile
      of debt and potential refinancing risks are also critical.
  - question: >
      How is free cash flow (FCF) calculated, and why is it important for renewable energy
      companies?
    answer: >
      Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash
      flow. This metric indicates the company's ability to generate surplus cash for debt
      servicing, reinvestment, and shareholder returns despite working capital fluctuations.
  - question: >
      What liquidity measures are essential for assessing a renewable energy company's
      cash flow health?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate cash and cash equivalents, the current ratio, and the quick
      ratio, as well as the availability of credit facilities. These measures indicate the
      firm's ability to meet short-term obligations and fund strategic initiatives.
  - question: >
      How should cash flow sensitivity analysis be performed in the renewable energy
      industry?
    answer: >
      Sensitivity analysis should assess the impact of changes in energy prices, project
      completions, and demand fluctuations on cash flow projections. Analysts must evaluate
      the firm's ability to adjust capital expenditures and operating costs in response to
      market conditions.
  - question: >
      How should risk management activities be incorporated into cash flow analysis
      for a renewable energy company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate hedging strategies using derivatives for managing energy,
      interest rate, and foreign exchange risks. They must also review insurance coverage
      and contingency planning measures to mitigate operational and market uncertainties.
