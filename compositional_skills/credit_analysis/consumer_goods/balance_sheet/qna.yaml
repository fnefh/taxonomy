  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate inventory management in a
      consumer goods company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine the levels and composition of inventory,
      including raw
      materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. They must assess turnover ratios,
      compare them to a benchmark, and evaluate the risk of obsolescence due to shifting
      consumer preferences or technological changes.
  - question: >
      How can PP&E be assessed in the context of a consumer goods company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review investments in manufacturing facilities,
      distribution
      centers, and equipment. They need to assess asset age, utilization rates, and the
      need for modernization to meet production demands and ensure efficiency.
  - question: >
      How should intangible assets, such as brand equity and goodwill, be
      analyzed?
    answer: >
      Analysts must evaluate the value of trademarks, brand names, and
      customer
      relationships, along with goodwill from acquisitions. They should consider the
      company's investment in brand development and potential impairment risks.
  - question: >
      What factors are critical when evaluating the debt structure and
      leverage of a
      consumer goods company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should analyze both short- and long-term debt, including
      interest rates,
      maturity profiles, and covenants. Leverage ratios like Debt-to-Equity and Debt-to-
      EBITDA must be compared with industry benchmarks to gauge the ability to service debt.
  - question: >
      How can liquidity and working capital management be assessed on the
      balance
      sheet of a consumer goods company?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current and quick ratios. Analysts
      should also
      review working capital by analyzing receivables, payables, and inventory levels,
      considering seasonal fluctuations and the impact on cash flow.
  - question: >
      What off-balance sheet items should be considered in the analysis of a
      consumer
      goods company?
    answer: >
      Analysts must identify off-balance sheet obligations such as operating
      leases for
      retail spaces or warehouses, as well as any contingent liabilities from legal
      disputes or regulatory issues, and assess their impact on future cash flows.
  - question: >
      How do currency and commodity exposures affect a consumer goods company's
      balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Currency fluctuations and raw material price volatility can
      significantly affect
      asset values and cost structures. Analysts should review hedging strategies and
      procurement contracts to mitigate these risks.
  - question: >
      How does seasonality impact a consumer goods company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Seasonal demand variations can affect inventory levels, receivables, and
      payables.
      Analysts must evaluate the company's strategies to manage seasonal working capital
      fluctuations and maintain liquidity during peak and off-peak periods.
