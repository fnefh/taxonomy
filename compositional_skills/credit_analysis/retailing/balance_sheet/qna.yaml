  - question: >
      How should a credit analyst evaluate inventory management in a retail company?
    answer: >
      Analysts should review the composition and valuation of inventory, including raw
      materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. They must calculate the Inventory
      Turnover Ratio (COGS/Average Inventory) and compare it with industry benchmarks.
      Additionally, assessing seasonal stock buildups and their impact on working capital
      is crucial.
  - question: |
      How should PP&E be analyzed on a retail company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts should evaluate fixed assets such as store locations, warehouses, and
      distribution centers. They must consider the valuation methods used and the
      proportion of owned versus leased properties, which has implications for long-term
      financial commitments.
  - question: >
      What factors are important when analyzing intangible assets in the retail sector?
    answer: >
      Analysts need to examine intangible assets like trademarks, brand value, and
      customer relationships. These assets contribute to competitive advantage and
      future revenue generation.
  - question: |
      How should liabilities be assessed in a retail company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Analysts must review accounts payable and supplier relationships by evaluating
      payment terms and bargaining power. They should also analyze the debt structure
      by calculating leverage ratios such as Debt-to-Equity, comparing them with industry
      norms.
  - question: >
      How can shareholders' equity and capital structure be analyzed in the retail
      industry?
    answer: >
      Analysts should examine changes in shareholder equity, including retained earnings,
      accumulated other comprehensive income, and treasury stock. Evaluating dividend
      policies, equity financing history, and share repurchase programs helps gauge capital
      strength.
  - question: >
      What liquidity metrics are critical for evaluating a retail company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      Key liquidity measures include the current ratio and quick ratio. Analysts should also
      analyze working capital management by reviewing the cash conversion cycle, including
      DIO, DSO, and DPO, to assess operational efficiency.
  - question: >
      How should off-balance sheet obligations be incorporated into a retail balance
      sheet analysis?
    answer: >
      Analysts must identify significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as
      operating leases for retail spaces, warehouses, or equipment. These items should be
      evaluated for their impact on future cash flows and overall financial flexibility.
  - question: >
      What overall insights can be drawn from a comprehensive analysis of a retail
      company's balance sheet?
    answer: >
      A comprehensive analysis integrates asset quality, inventory management, liability
      structure, equity, and liquidity metrics. This approach highlights risks such as
      high inventory levels, excessive leverage, liquidity constraints, and significant lease
      obligations that may affect the company's creditworthiness.
