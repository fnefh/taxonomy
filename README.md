<h2>Welcome to the InstructLab Taxonomy</h2>
<p>InstructLab üê∂ uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for
Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "<strong>lab</strong>" in Instruct<strong>Lab</strong> üê∂ stands for
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081"><strong>L</strong>arge-Scale <strong>A</strong>lignment for Chat<strong>B</strong>ots</a> [1].</p>
<p>The LAB method is driven by taxonomies, which are largely created manually and
with care.</p>
<p>This repository contains a taxonomy tree that allows you to create models
tuned with your data (enhanced via synthetic data generation) using the LAB üê∂
method.</p>

<h2>Choosing domains for the taxonomy</h2>
<p>In general, we use the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) System to determine our domains (and subdomains) in the taxonomy. This <a href="https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/oclc/dewey/resources/summaries/deweysummaries.pdf">DDC SUMMARIES document</a> is a great resource for determining where a topic might be classified.</p>
<p>If you are unsure where to put your knowledge or compositional skill, create a folder in the <code>miscellaneous_unknown</code> folder under the <code>knowledge</code> or <code>compositional_skills</code> folders.</p>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Learn about the concepts of "skills" and "knowledge" in our <a href="https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/docs/README.md">InstructLab Community Learning Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Skill Contributions</h2>
<p>Skills require a much smaller volume of content than knowledge contributions. An entire skill contribution to the taxonomy tree can be just a few lines of YAML in the <code>qna.yaml</code> file ("qna" is short for "questions and answers") and an <code>attribution.txt</code> file for citing sources.</p>
<p>Your skills contribution pull requests must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>qna.yaml</code> that contains a set of key/value entries with the following keys</li>
<li>Each <code>qna.yaml</code> file requires a minimum of five question and answer pairs.</li>
<li>An <code>attribution.txt</code> that includes the sources for the information used in the <code>qna.yaml</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
The skill taxonomy structure is used in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>To select the right subset of the taxonomy to use for data generation.</li>
<li>To determine the interpretability by human contributors and maintainers.</li>
<li>As part of the prompt to the LLM used to generate synthetic samples.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
There is a limit to how much content can exist in the question/answer pairs for the model to process. Due to this, only add a maximum
of around 2300 words to your question and answer seed example pairs in the <code>qna.yaml</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compositional skills can either be grounded (includes a context) or ungrounded (does not include a context).  Grounded or ungrounded is declared in the taxonomy tree, for example: <code>linguistics/writing/poetry/haiku/</code> (ungrounded) or <code>grounded/linguistics/grammar</code> (grounded). The <code>qna.yaml</code> is in the final node.</p>
<p>Taxonomy skill files must be a valid <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file named <code>qna.yaml</code>. Each <code>qna.yaml</code> file contains a set of key/value entries with the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>version</code>: The value must be the number 2. <strong>Required</strong></li>
<li><code>task_description</code>: A description of the skill. <strong>Required</strong></li>
<li><code>created_by</code>: The GitHub username of the contributor. <strong>Required</strong></li>
<li><code>seed_examples</code>: A collection of key/value entries. New
  submissions should have at least five entries, although
  older files may have fewer. <strong>Required</strong></li>
<li><code>context</code>: Grounded skills require the user to provide context containing information that the model is expected to take into account during processing. This is different from knowledge, where the model is expected to gain facts and background knowledge from the tuning process. The context key should not be used for ungrounded skills.</li>
<li><code>question</code>: A question for the model. <strong>Required</strong></li>
<li><code>answer</code>: The desired response from the model. <strong>Required</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Other keys at any level are currently ignored.</p>
<h3>Skills: YAML examples</h3>
<p>To make the <code>qna.yaml</code> files easier and faster for humans to read, it is recommended to specify <code>version</code> first, followed by <code>task_description</code>, then <code>created_by</code>, and finally <code>seed_examples</code>.
In <code>seed_examples</code>, it is recommended to specify <code>context</code> first (if applicable), followed by <code>question</code> and <code>answer</code>.</p>
<p><em>Example <code>qna.yaml</code></em></p>
<p><code>yaml
version: 2
task_description: &lt;string&gt;
created_by: &lt;string&gt;
seed_examples:
  - question: &lt;string&gt;
    answer: |
      &lt;multi-line string&gt;
  - context: |
      &lt;multi-line string&gt;
    question: &lt;string&gt;
    answer: |
      &lt;multi-line string&gt;
  ...</code></p>
<p>Then, you create an <code>attribution.txt</code> file that includes the sources of your information. These can also be self authored sources.</p>
<p><em>Example <code>attribution.txt</code></em></p>
<p><code>text
[Link to source]
[Link to work]
[License of the work]
[Creator name]</code></p>
<p>For more information on what to include in your <code>attribution.txt</code> file, see <a href="https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-your-attributiontxt-file">For your attribution.txt file</a> in CONTRIBUTING.md.</p>
<p>If you have not written YAML before, don't be intimidated - it's just text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces and indentation matter in YAML. Two spaces to indent.</li>
<li>Don't use tabs!</li>
<li>Be careful to not have trailing spaces at the end of a line.</li>
<li>Each example in <code>seed_examples</code> begins with a "-". Place this "-" in
  front of the first field (<code>question</code> or <code>context</code>). The remaining keys in the
  example should not have this "-".</li>
<li>Some special characters such as " and ' need to be escaped with backslash. This is why some
  of the lines for keys in the example YAML start the value with the '|' character followed a new line and then an indented multi-line string.
  This character disables all of the special characters in the value for the key.
  You might also want to use the '|' character for multi-line strings.</li>
<li>Consider quoting all values with " to avoid surprising YAML parser behavior
  (e.g. Yes answer can be interpreted by the parser as a boolean of <code>True</code>
  value, unless "Yes" is quoted.)</li>
<li>See https://yaml-multiline.info/ for more info.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It is recommended that you <strong>lint</strong>, or verify, your YAML using a tool. One linter option is <a href="https://yamllint.com">yamllint.com</a>. You can copy/paste your YAML into the box and click <strong>Go</strong> to have it analyze your YAML and make recommendations. Online tools like <a href="https://onlineyamltools.com/prettify-yaml">prettified</a> and <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator">yaml-validator</a> can automatically reformat your YAML to adhere to our <code>yamllint</code> PR checks, such as breaking lines longer than 120 characters.</p>
<h4>Ungrounded compositional skill: YAML example</h4>
<p><code>yaml

<p>Seriously, that's it.</p>
<p>Here is the location of this YAML in the taxonomy tree. Note that the YAML file
itself, plus any added directories that contain the file, is the entirety of the skill
in terms of a taxonomy contribution:</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Knowledge Contributions</h2>
<p>While skills are foundational or performative, knowledge is based more on answering questions that involve facts,
data, or references.</p>
<p>Knowledge is supported by documents, such as a textbook, technical manual, encyclopedia, journal, or magazine.</p>
<p>Knowledge in the taxonomy tree consists of a few more elements than skills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
If you are using InstructLab version <code>0.21.0</code> or above, you can specify PDF files in your knowledge <code>qna.yaml</code> file as a valid document type. Any previous version of InstructLab still only consumes knowledge documents in markdown format.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each knowledge node in the tree has a <code>qna.yaml</code>, similar to the format of the <code>qna.yaml</code> for skills.</li>
<li>‚≠ê Knowledge submissions require you to create a Git repository, can be with GitHub, that contains the files of your knowledge contributions.</li>
<li>The <code>qna.yaml</code> includes parameters that contain information from your repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Guidelines for Knowledge contributions</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit the most up-to-date version of the document</li>
<li>All submissions must be text, images will be ignored</li>
<li>Do not use tables in your markdown freeform contribution</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>qna.yaml</code> format must include the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>version</code>: The version of the qna.yaml file, this is the format of the file used for SDG. The value must be the number 3.</li>
<li><code>created_by</code>: Your GitHub username.</li>
<li><code>domain</code>: Specify the category of the knowledge.</li>
<li><code>seed_examples</code>: A collection of key/value entries.</li>
<li><code>context</code>: A chunk of information from the knowledge document. Each <code>qna.yaml</code> needs five <code>context</code> blocks and has a maximum word count of 500 words.</li>
<li><code>questions_and_answers</code>: The parameter that holds your questions and answers<ul>
<li><code>question</code>: Specify a question for the model. Each <code>qna.yaml</code> file needs at least three question and answer pairs per <code>context</code> chunk with a maximum word count of 250 words.</li>
<li><code>answer</code>: Specify the desired answer from the model. Each <code>qna.yaml</code> file needs at least three question and answer pairs per <code>context</code> chunk with a maximum word count of 250 words.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>document_outline</code>: Describe an overview of the document your submitting.</li>
<li><code>document</code>: The source of your knowledge contribution.</li>
<li><code>repo</code>: The URL to your repository that holds your knowledge files.</li>
<li><code>commit</code>: The SHA of the commit in your repository with your knowledge files.</li>
<li><code>patterns</code>: A list of glob patterns specifying the files in your repository. Any glob pattern that starts with <code>*</code>, such as <code>*.md</code>, must be quoted due to YAML rules. For example, <code>"*.md"</code>.</li>
</ul>

  - context: |
      Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by <a href="Petrus_Plancius" title="wikilink">Petrus
      Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser" title="wikilink">Pieter
      Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick_de_Houtman" title="wikilink">Frederick de
      Houtman</a>. It first appeared on a 35cm
      diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by
      Plancius with <a href="Jodocus_Hondius" title="wikilink">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first
      depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in <a href="Johann_Bayer" title="wikilink">Johann
      Bayer</a>'s
      <em><a href="Uranometria" title="wikilink">Uranometria</a></em> of 1603. De Houtman included
      it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name <em>Den
      voghel Fenicx</em>, "The Bird Phoenix", symbolising the
      <a href="Phoenix_(mythology)" title="wikilink">phoenix</a> of classical mythology. One
      name of the brightest star <a href="Alpha_Phoenicis" title="wikilink">Alpha
      Phoenicis</a>‚ÄîAnkaa‚Äîis derived from the Arabic:
      ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸÇÿßÿ°, romanized: al-‚ÄòanqƒÅ‚Äô, lit.‚Äâ'the phoenix', and
      was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.

<h1>Phoenix (constellation)</h1>
<p><strong>Phoenix</strong> is a minor <a href="constellation" title="wikilink">constellation</a> in the
<a href="southern_sky" title="wikilink">southern sky</a>. Named after the mythical
<a href="Phoenix_(mythology)" title="wikilink">phoenix</a>, it was first depicted on a
celestial atlas by <a href="Johann_Bayer" title="wikilink">Johann Bayer</a> in his 1603
<em><a href="Uranometria" title="wikilink">Uranometria</a></em>. The French explorer and
astronomer <a href="Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille" title="wikilink">Nicolas Louis de
Lacaille</a> charted the brighter
stars and gave their <a href="Bayer_designation" title="wikilink">Bayer designations</a>
in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly ‚àí39 degrees to ‚àí57 degrees
<a href="declination" title="wikilink">declination</a>, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of <a href="right_ascension" title="wikilink">right
ascension</a>. The constellations Phoenix,
<a href="Grus_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Grus</a>,
<a href="Pavo_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Pavo</a> and <a href="Tucana" title="wikilink">Tucana</a>,
are known as the Southern Birds.</p>
<p>The brightest star, <a href="Alpha_Phoenicis" title="wikilink">Alpha Phoenicis</a>, is
named Ankaa, an <a href="Arabic" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> word meaning 'the Phoenix'.
It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is <a href="Beta_Phoenicis" title="wikilink">Beta
Phoenicis</a>, actually a
<a href="Binary_star" title="wikilink">binary</a> system composed of two yellow giants
with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. <a href="Nu_Phoenicis" title="wikilink">Nu
Phoenicis</a> has a dust disk, while the
constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently
discovered <a href="galaxy_cluster" title="wikilink">galaxy clusters</a> <a href="El_Gordo_(galaxy_cluster)" title="wikilink">El
Gordo</a> and the <a href="Phoenix_Cluster" title="wikilink">Phoenix
Cluster</a>‚Äîlocated 7.2 and 5.7 billion light
years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the <a href="visible_universe" title="wikilink">visible
universe</a>. Phoenix is the
<a href="radiant_(meteor_shower)" title="wikilink">radiant</a> of two annual <a href="meteor_shower" title="wikilink">meteor
showers</a>: the
<a href="Phoenicids" title="wikilink">Phoenicids</a> in December, and the July

<p>You can organize the knowledge markdown files in your repository however you want. You just need to ensure the YAML is pointing to the correct file.</p>
<h2>Taxonomy tree Layout</h2>
<p>The taxonomy tree is organized in a cascading directory structure. At the end of
each branch, there is a YAML file (qna.yaml) that contains the examples for that
domain. Maintainers can decide to change the names of the existing branches or to add new branches.</p>

<h2>Contribute knowledge and skills to the taxonomy</h2>
<p>The ability to contribute to a Large Language Model (LLM) has been difficult in no small part because it is difficult to get access to the necessary compute infrastructure.</p>
<p>This taxonomy repository will be used as the seed to synthesize the training data for InstructLab-trained models. We intend to retrain the model(s) using the main branch following InstructLab's progressive training on a regular basis. This enables fast iteration of the model(s), for the benefit of the open source community.</p>
<p>By contributing your skills and knowledge to this repository, you will see your changes built into an LLM within days of your contribution rather than months or years! If you are working with a model and notice its knowledge or ability lacking, you can correct it by contributing knowledge or skills and check if it's improved after your changes are built.</p>
<p>While public contributions are welcome to help drive community progress, you can also fork this repository under <a href="LICENSE">the Apache License, Version 2.0</a>, add your own internal skills, and train your own models internally. However, you might need your own access to significant compute infrastructure to perform sufficient retraining.</p>
<h2>Ways to Contribute</h2>
<p>You can contribute to the taxonomy in the following two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding new examples to <strong>existing leaf nodes</strong>:</li>
<li>Adding <strong>new branches/skills</strong> corresponding to the existing domain:</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#ways-of-contributing-to-the-taxonomy-repository">Ways of contributing to the taxonomy repository</a> documentation.</p>
<h2>How to contribute skills and knowledge</h2>
<p>To contribute to this repo, you'll use the <em>Fork and Pull</em> model common in many open source repositories. You can add your skills and knowledge to the taxonomy in multiple ways; for additional information on how to make a contribution, see the <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">Documentation on contributing</a>. You can also use the following guides to help with contributing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing using the <a href="docs/contributing_via_GH_UI.md">GitHub webpage UI</a>.</li>
<li>Contributing knowledge to the taxonomy in the <a href="docs/knowledge-contribution-guide.md">Knowledge contribution guidelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why should I contribute?</h3>
<p>This taxonomy repository will be used as the seed to synthesize the training
data for InstructLab-trained models. We intend to retrain the model(s) using the main
branch as often as possible (at least weekly).
Fast iteration of the model(s) benefits the open source community and enables model developers who do not have access to the necessary compute infrastructure.</p>
