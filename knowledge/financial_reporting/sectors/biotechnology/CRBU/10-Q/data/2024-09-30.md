Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of the Business, Organization, and Liquidity

---

Business and Organization
-------------------------

Caribou Biosciences, Inc. ("Company" or "we") is a clinical-stage C lustered R egularly I nterspaced S hort P alindromic R epeats ("CRISPR") genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for patients with devastating diseases. Our genome-editing platform, including our novel chRDNA ( C RISPR h ybrid R NADNA , or "chRDNA," pronounced "chardonnay") technology, enables more precise genome editing to develop cell therapies that are armored to improve activity against diseases. We are advancing a pipeline of allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, cell therapies from our chimeric antigen receptor ("CAR") T ("CAR-T") cell platform as readily available therapeutic treatments for patients.

We incorporated in October 2011 as a Delaware corporation and are headquartered in Berkeley, California. We havefour wholly owned subsidiaries: Antler Holdco, LLC, incorporated in Delaware in April 2019; Microbe Holdco, LLC, incorporated in Delaware in June 2020; Arboreal Holdco, LLC, incorporated in Delaware in November 2020; and Biloba Holdco, LLC, incorporated in Delaware in April 2021. Our wholly owned subsidiaries hold interests in our equity investments and do not have operating activities.

Liquidity
---------

We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we had an accumulated deficit of $412.9 million as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $113.6 million and used $102.7 million of cash in operating activities. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses, and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our product candidates and on our ability to generate sufficient revenue to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability and, unless and until we do, we will need to continue to raise additional capital. Our management expects that existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $281.0 million as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q").

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

---

There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2 to the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K").

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
-----------------------------------------------------

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates
----------------

The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenue, income, and expenses during the applicable reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, accrued expenses related to research and development activities, valuation of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ("MSKCC") success payments liability, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and income taxes. Our management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.

Segments
--------

We operate and manage our business asone reportable operating segment, which is the business of developing a pipeline of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies. Our president and chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. All long-lived assets are maintained in the United States.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Other Uncertainties
-----------------------------------------------------

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets, other receivables, and investments in marketable securities and equity securities. Substantially all our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in accounts at four financial institutions, and our account balances exceed federally insured limits. We mitigate the risks by investing in high-grade instruments, limiting our exposure to one issuer, and we monitor the ongoing creditworthiness of these financial institutions and issuers.

Licensees that represent 10% or more of our revenue and accounts receivable and contract assets were as follows:

| | Revenue Three Months Ended | Revenue Three Months Ended | Revenue Nine Months Ended | Revenue Nine Months Ended | Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets As of December 31, | Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets As of December 31, |

| Total | 90.8 % | 90.8 % | 68.3 % | 79.1 % | 84.4 % | 47.5 % |

\*Less than 10%
---------------

We monitor economic conditions to identify facts or circumstances that may indicate if any of our accounts receivable are not collectible or if contract assets should be impaired. No allowance for credit losses or contract asset impairment was recorded as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
------------------------------------------------

In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. This ASU aligns the requirements in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") to the removal of certain disclosure requirements set out in Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, announced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The effective date for each amended topic in the ASC is either the date on which the SEC's removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective or June 30, 2027, if the SEC has not removed the requirements by that date. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance and do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-06 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate

reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance and do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-02, Codification Improvements - Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements. The amendments in ASU 2024-02 clarify and simplify references to certain concept statements within U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-02.

1. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

---

The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:

Level 1 -Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 -Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 -Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entireties based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires our management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.

Our financial instruments consist of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 financial instruments. We generally classify our marketable securities as Level 1 or Level 2. Instruments are classified as Level 2 when observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets are used. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, such instruments are priced using benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, matrix pricing, and valuation models. These valuation models are proprietary to the pricing providers or brokers and incorporate a number of inputs including, in approximate order of priority: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research publications. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the standard inputs may not be applicable. Evaluators may prioritize inputs differently on any given day for any security based on market conditions, and not all inputs listed are available for use in the evaluation process for each security valuation on any given day. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels of certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy in the period in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. No such transfers occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Level 1 financial instruments are comprised of money market fund investments and U.S. Treasury bills. Level 2 financial instruments are comprised of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and U.S. government agency bonds. Financial assets and liabilities are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 financial instruments consist of the MSKCC success payments liability.

The following table sets forth our financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $ 2,939 |
| Change in fair value | (1,934) |
| Balance at September 30, 2024 | $ 1,005 |

Our liability for the MSKCC success payments is carried at fair value and changes are recognized as expense or income as part of other income until the success payments liability is paid or expires. We recorded a $0.2 million and $0.1 million change in the fair value of the MSKCC success payments liability as a lossin other income in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We recorded a $1.9 million and $0.4 million change in the fair value of the MSKCC success payments liability as a gainin other income in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

The table below summarizes key assumptions used in the valuation of the MSKCC success payments liability:

| | As of December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- |
| Fair value of common stock | $ 5.73 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 3.88% |
| Expected volatility | 79% |
| Probability of achieving multiple of Initial Share Price (1) | 5.2% to 18.1% |
| Expected term (years) | 3.7 to 5.2 |

The computation of expected volatility was estimated using a combination of available information about the historical volatility of stocks of similar publicly traded companies for a period matching the expected term assumption and the historical and implied volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected term assumptions depend on the time period from the initiation of our AMpLify phase 1 clinical trial for our CB-012 product candidate utilizing the knowhow, biological materials, and intellectual property licensed under the Exclusive License Agreement, dated November 13, 2020, with MSKCC ("MSKCC Agreement") until the estimated timing of marketing approval for this product candidate from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). In addition, we incorporated the estimated number and timing of valuation measurement dates in the calculation of the MSKCC success payments liability.

As of September 30, 2024, we did not note any significant changes to the inputs used in the MSKCC success payments liability fair value calculation, other than a change in the fair value of our common stock to $1.96 per share.

1. Significant Agreements

Disaggregation of Revenue
-------------------------

We disaggregate revenue by geographical market based on the location of research and development activities of our licensees and collaborators.The following table is a summary of revenue by geographic location for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| United States | $ 1,657 | $ 23,285 | $ 7,370 | $ 30,416 |
| Rest of world | 367 | 377 | 547 | 503 |
| Total | $ 2,024 | $ 23,662 | $ 7,917 | $ 30,919 |

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $1.4 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, and we recognized $0.6 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over time.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $1.6 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, and we recognized $22.1 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over time that included $21.5 million in licensing and collaboration revenue associated with the now-terminated AbbVie Agreement.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $6.0 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, and we recognized $1.9 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over time.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $5.8 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, and we recognized $25.1 million of revenue related to performance obligations satisfied over time which included $24.5 million in licensing and collaboration revenue associated with the now-terminated AbbVie Agreement.

Contract Balances
-----------------

Accounts receivable relate to our right to consideration for performance obligations completed (or partially completed) for which we have an unconditional right to consideration. Our accounts receivable balances represent amounts that we billed to our licensees with invoices outstanding as of the end of a reporting period.

Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for a license that we have granted to a licensee when the right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract asset balances represent royalties and milestone payments from our other license agreements that are unbilled as of the end of a reporting period.

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and relate to amounts invoiced to, or advance consideration received from, licensees that precede our satisfaction of the associated performance obligations. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our deferred revenue balance primarily resulted from the upfront payment received relating to our performance obligation to Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"). The remaining deferred revenue relates to upfront payments received under license agreements that also include nonrefundable annual license fees, which are accounted for as material rights for license renewals and are recognized at the point in time when annual license fees are paid by the licensees and the renewal periods begin.

The following table presents changes in our contract assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | Balance as of December 31, 2023 | Additions | Deductions | Balance as of September 30, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts receivable | $ 148 | $ 4,757 | $ (4,721) | $ 184 |
| Contract assets: | | | | |
| Unbilled accounts receivable | $ 1,425 | $ 2,663 | $ (3,290) | $ 798 |
| Contract liabilities: | | | | |
| Deferred revenue, current and long-term | $ 8,949 | $ 1,250 | $ (3,423) | $ 6,776 |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recognized $2.2 million and $23.2 million of revenue, respectively, which was included in the opening contract liabilities balances at the beginning of the respective periods.

Transaction Prices Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Remaining performance obligations represent in aggregate the amount of a transaction price that has been allocated to performance obligations not delivered as of the end of a reporting period. The value of transaction prices allocated to remaining unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2024, was approximately $6.8 million. We expect to recognize approximately $2.8 million of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next 12 months and to recognize the remainder thereafter.

Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs and Fulfillment Costs
------------------------------------------------------------

We did not incur any expenses to obtain our existing contracts, and costs to fulfill those contracts do not generate or enhance our resources. As such, no costs to obtain or fulfill a contract have been capitalized in any period.

1. Commitments and Contingencies

---

Research, Manufacturing, and License Agreements
-----------------------------------------------

We enter into various agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as those with contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs"), suppliers, clinical research organizations ("CROs"), clinical trial sites, licensors, assignors, and the like. These agreements provide for termination by either party in certain circumstances, generally with less than one-year notice and are, therefore, cancellable contracts and, if cancelled, are not anticipated to have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Some of these agreements also include contingent payments that will become payable if and when certain development, regulatory, clinical, and/or commercial milestones are achieved by us. As of September 30, 2024, satisfaction and timing of such contingent payments are uncertain and thus cannot be reasonably estimated.

Guarantees and Indemnifications
-------------------------------

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for certain indemnifications by us. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because claims may be made against us in the future. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible, and consequently, we have not recorded related liabilities.

Litigation
----------

From time to time, we may become involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability for such litigation when it is probable that future losses will be incurred and if such losses can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment by us is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.

On April 11, 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against our company and certain of our officers and current and former members of our board of directors, Bergman v. Caribou Biosciences, Inc., et al. , Case Number 23-cv-01742 ("Bergman Case"). The Bergman complaint challenged disclosures regarding our company's business, operations, and prospects, specifically with respect to the alleged durability of CB-010's therapeutic effect and the product candidate's clinical and commercial prospects, in alleged violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). On September 18, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the initial public offering ("IPO") underwriters as defendants and making substantially the same allegations as the original complaint. On November 14, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Motion to dismiss briefing was completed on February 21, 2024. On April 22, 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to settle the Bergman Case for $3.9 million, which was included in general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, in exchange for a full release of the putative class's claims against us and all our current and former officers, current and former members of our board of directors, the IPO underwriters, and the other named defendant. The parties filed a settlement agreement with the court on June 26, 2024, and, on October 15, 2024, the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement and setting a final settlement approval hearing for February 18, 2025.

Shelf Registration Statement
----------------------------

On August 9, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ("Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC. The Shelf Registration Statement allows us to sell from time to time up to $400.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units comprised of any combination of these securities, for our own account in one or more offerings (including the $100.0 million of common stock reserved for our at-the-market equity offering program). The SEC declared the Shelf Registration Statement effective on August 16, 2022. The terms of any offering under the Shelf Registration Statement will be established at the time of such offering, as described in a prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.

In July and August 2023, we issued and sold a total of22,115,384 shares of our common stock in an underwritten follow-on public offering at a price to the public of $6.50 per share, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' right to purchase 2,884,615 additional shares of our common stock. The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $143.7 million ($134.4 million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). The shares were issued pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.

At-the-market Equity Offering Program
-------------------------------------

On August 9, 2022, we entered into an at-the-market Open Market Sale Agreement ("ATM Sales Agreement") with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"), pursuant to which, through Jefferies as sales agent, we may from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in gross proceeds under the Shelf Registration Statement. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 1,762,806 shares of our common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement, at an average price per share of $7.32 for aggregate gross proceeds of $12.9 million ($12.3 million net of offering expenses).

Equity Incentive Plans
----------------------

In July 2021, our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan ("2021 Plan") that became effective on July 22, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had 6,827,620 shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.

The following table summarizes stock option activity under our equity incentive plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Table of Contents

| | Stock Options | Weighted- Average Exercise Price | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 9,410,404 | $ 8.03 | 8.0 | $ 6,432 |
| Options granted | 3,528,702 | 5.97 | | |
| Options exercised | (182,217) | 3.39 | | |
| Options cancelled or forfeited | (1,145,525) | 8.35 | | |

| Exercisable at September 30, 2024 | 5,810,961 | $ 8.03 | 6.1 | $ 41 |
| Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 | 11,611,364 | $ 7.44 | 7.4 | $ 41 |

Grant Date Fair Value
---------------------

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we granted391,525 and 384,095 stock options to employees with a weighted average grant date fair value of $1.49 and $3.64, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we granted3,528,702 and 3,406,801 stock options to employees with a weighted average grant date fair value of $4.09 and $3.91, respectively.

We estimated the fair value of each employee stock option award on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Volatility | 75.8% | 74.2% to 74.6% | 75.7% to 75.9% | 74.2% to 75.0% |
| Expected term (in years) | 6.0 | 6.0 | 5.0 to 6.0 | 5.0 to 6.0 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 3.7% to 3.8% | 4.1% to 4.6% | 3.7% to 4.5% | 3.5% to 4.6% |
| Expected dividend yield | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |

As of September 30, 2024, there was $24.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.

Restricted Stock Units
----------------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted1,342,842 restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees,and we did not grant any performancebased RSUs ("PSUs") to employees under the 2021 Plan. A summary of the status of and change in unvested RSUs and PSUs as of September 30, 2024, was as follows:

Table of Contents

| | Number of Shares Underlying Outstanding RSUs and PSUs | Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per RSU and PSU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unvested, January 1, 2024 | 205,357 | $ 8.49 |
| Granted | 1,342,842 | 5.71 |
| Vested | (66,173) | 10.07 |
| Forfeited | (179,180) | 7.17 |
| Unvested, September 30, 2024 | 1,302,846 | $ 5.73 |

On August 22, 2022, we granted PSUs to our executive officers, which will vest contingent upon the achievement of a clinical milestone for CB-010 during a performance period ending December 31, 2024, and the executive officer's continued employment during the performance period. As of September 30, 2024, the achievement of this milestone was not considered probable and, therefore, no stock-based compensation was recorded.

As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $5.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.9 years. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $0.4 million of unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to unvested PSUs.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP")
-------------------------------------

In July 2021, our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the ESPP, which became effective on July 22, 2021. We issued468,745 shares of common stock under the ESPP as of September 30, 2024. We recorded $0.1 million in accrued liabilities related to contributions withheld as of September 30, 2024.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
--------------------------------

We recorded stock-based compensation expense related to employee equity-based awards grants in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as follows (in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Research and development | $ 1,638 | $ 1,464 | $ 5,248 | $ 4,324 |
| General and administrative | 2,431 | 2,014 | 7,547 | 5,870 |
| Total | $ 4,069 | $ 3,478 | $ 12,795 | $ 10,194 |

The above stock-based compensation expense related to the following equity-based awards (in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Stock options | $ 3,530 | $ 3,188 | $ 10,909 | $ 9,188 |
| ESPP | 80 | 96 | 309 | 427 |
| RSUs | 459 | 194 | 1,577 | 579 |
| Total | $ 4,069 | $ 3,478 | $ 12,795 | $ 10,194 |

1. 401(k) Savings Plan

---

In 2017, we established a defined-contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Tax Code"). Our 401(k) plan is available to all employees and allows participants to defer a portion of

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

their annual compensation on a pretax basis subject to applicable laws. We also provide a4% match for employee contributions up to a certain limit. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we contributed $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, to our 401(k) plan.

1. Income Taxes

---

No income tax expense was recorded during each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 due to our operating losses.

1. Net Loss Per Share

---

The following table sets forth the computation of the basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):

Table of Contents

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Numerator: | | | | |
| Net loss | $ (34,684) | $ (10,002) | $ (113,615) | $ (67,565) |
| Denominator: | | | | |
| Weighted-average common shares outstanding used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted | 90,455,900 | 83,783,992 | 90,034,799 | 68,878,921 |
| Net loss per share, basic and diluted | $ (0.38) | $ (0.12) | $ (1.26) | $ (0.98) |

Because we were in a net loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods, as the inclusion of all common stock equivalents outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the diluted per share calculations because they would be anti-dilutive were as follows:

| | As of September 30, 2024 | As of September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stock options outstanding | 11,611,364 | 9,523,394 |
| RSUs issued and outstanding | 1,259,377 | 168,438 |
| Shares committed under ESPP | 304,434 | 134,276 |
| | 13,175,175 | 9,826,108 |

1. Restructuring Charge

---

On July 16, 2024, we announced that we had discontinued preclinical research activities associated with our allogeneic CAR-NK platform and reduced our workforce by 21 positions, or approximately 12%. The workforce reduction was completed during the third quarter of 2024. As a result, we recorded a total of $ 0.6 million in non-recurring restructuring charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of cash severance costs, continuation of benefits, and transition support services for impacted employees.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 ("Form 10Q") and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 11, 2024.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
-------------------------------------------------

This Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our business strategy, plans, and objectives; expectations regarding our clinical and preclinical development programs, including our expectations about the timing of such programs; the expected timing of disclosure of clinical data from such programs; the safety, efficacy, and potential advantages of our product candidates; future regulatory filings and interactions with regulatory authorities; our results of operations and financial position; and plans and objectives of management for future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "could," "intend," "target," "project," "contemplate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.

As a result of many factors, including but not limited to risks related to our limited operating history, history of net operating losses, financial position and our ability to raise additional capital as needed to fund our operations and product candidate development; risks inherent in the development of cell therapy products; risks associated with the initiation, cost, timing, progress, and results of current and future research and development programs, preclinical studies, and clinical trials; the risk that initial, preliminary, or interim clinical trial data will not ultimately be predictive of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or that clinical outcomes may differ as patient enrollment continues and as more clinical data becomes available or different conclusions or considerations are reached once additional data have been received and fully evaluated; the risk that preclinical study results will not be borne out in human patients; risks related to our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates; risks that our product candidates, if approved, may not gain market acceptance due to negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of cell therapies involving genome editing; risks related to our ability to meet future regulatory standards with respect to our products; risks related to our ability to establish and/or maintain intellectual property rights covering our product candidates and genome-editing technology; risks of third parties asserting that our product candidates infringe their patents; risks related to developments of our competitors and our industry; risks related to our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture our product candidates; risks caused by public health crises or geopolitical events on our business and operations; and other risks described in greater detail in the section of our Form 10-K titled "Risk Factors," and in other filings we make with the SEC, the events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or may not occur, and actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by the forward-looking statements. As a result of these risks, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Overview
--------

We are a clinical-stage C lustered R egularly I nterspaced S hort P alindromic R epeats ("CRISPR") genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for patients with devastating diseases. Our genome-editing platform, including our novel chRDNA ( C RISPR h ybrid R NADNA , or "chRDNA," pronounced "chardonnay") technology, enables more precise genome editing to develop cell therapies that are armored to improve activity against diseases. We are advancing a pipeline of allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, cell therapies from our chimeric antigen receptor ("CAR") T ("CAR-T") cell platform as readily available therapeutic treatments for patients.

We are currently focused on advancing our allogeneic cell therapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Our therapies are directed at established cell surface targets for which autologous CAR-T cell therapeutics have already demonstrated clinical proof of concept, including CD19 and B cell maturation antigen ("BCMA"), as well as other targets such as C-type lectin-like molecule-1 ("CLL-1," also known as CD371). We use our

Table of Contents
-----------------

chRDNA technologies to armor our cell therapies through multiple genome-editing strategies, such as checkpoint disruption, immune cloaking, or a combination of these two strategies, to enhance activity against devastating diseases.

Our lead product candidate, CB-010, is an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy that is being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ("r/r B-NHL") in our ongoing ANTLER phase 1 clinical trial. To our knowledge, CB-010 is the first clinical-stage allogeneic anti-CD19 CART cell therapy with programmed cell death protein 1 ("PD-1") removed from the CAR-T cell surface by a genome-edited knockout of the PDCD1 gene.

In our ANTLER phase 1 clinical trial, 16 patients with multiple subtypes of aggressive r/r B-NHL were enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the clinical trial, and three dose levels of CB-010 were evaluated: dose level 1 (40x10 viable CAR-T cells, n=8), dose level 2 (80x10 viable CAR-T cells, n=5), and dose level 3 (120x10 viable CAR-T cells, n=3). Following the conclusion of the dose escalation portion of our ANTLER clinical trial, we began enrolling second-line ("2L") large B cell lymphoma ("LBCL") patients in the dose expansion phase of our ANTLER clinical trial, which is still ongoing. Dose level 2 (80x10 viable CAR-T cells) was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose ("RP2D"). In early June 2024, we presented safety, efficacy, and translational data for the first 46 patients evaluated in our ANTLER phase 1 clinical trial during a poster presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") Annual Meeting. CB-010 was generally welltolerated with adverse events as expected for anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies. A retrospective analysis of the ANTLER clinical trial data showed that patients who received a dose of CB-010 manufactured from a healthy donor who shared four or more matching human leukocyte antigen ("HLA") alleles with the patient (referred to as "partial HLA matching") demonstrated the potential for improved efficacy. Based on these data, we have begun dosing a cohort of approximately 20 2L LBCL patients to prospectively evaluate whether partial HLA matching improves patient outcomes. In addition, we are enrolling approximately 10 patients who have relapsed following any prior CD19-targeted therapy in a proof-of-concept cohort, which will also incorporate partial HLA matching. We plan to report initial data from both cohorts in the first half of 2025. Upon confirmation of improved outcomes in 2L LBCL patients receiving a partially HLA matched dose of CB-010, we expect to initiate a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2025, following agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") on a pivotal trial design. CB-010 received regenerative medicine advanced therapy ("RMAT") designation for relapsed or refractory LBCL, fast track designation for r/r B-NHL, and orphan drug designation for follicular lymphoma ("FL") from the FDA. 6 6 6 6

We are expanding our clinical development of CB-010 to include autoimmune diseases, and we plan to evaluate CB-010 in our multicenter, open label, GALLOP phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with lupus nephritis ("LN") and extrarenal lupus ("ERL"), which will incorporate partial HLA matching. We expect to initiate our GALLOP clinical trial by year-end 2024. CB-010 received fast track designation for refractory systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE") from the FDA.

Our second product candidate, CB-011, is an allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy that is, to our knowledge, the first anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy incorporating an immune cloaking approach that includes both the removal of the endogenous beta-2 microglobulin ("B2M") protein and insertion of a beta-2-microglobulin-humanleukocyte-antigen-E-peptide transgene ("B2M-HLA-E"). This strategy is designed to reduce CAR-T cell rejection by both patient T cells and natural killer ("NK") cells to potentially enable more durable antitumor activity. CB-011 is being evaluated in our CaMMouflage phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma ("r/r MM"), and we are currently enrolling patients in the dose escalation portion of the CaMMouflage trial. Recently, we implemented a lymphodepletion regimen that includes a higher dose of cyclophosphamide than was part of the original protocol, and we plan to present initial dose escalation data from our CaMMouflage phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2025. CB-011 received fast track and orphan drug designations for r/r MM from the FDA.

The third product candidate from our CAR-T cell platform is CB-012, an allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy targeting CLL-1. CB-012 is, to our knowledge, the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy with both checkpoint disruption and immune cloaking strategies. We believe that CLL-1 is an attractive target for acute myeloid leukemia ("AML") due to its expression on myeloid cancer cells, its enrichment on leukemic stem cells, and its absence on hematopoietic stem cells ("HSCs"). CB-012 is being evaluated in our AMpLify phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML ("r/r AML"), and we are currently enrolling patients in the dose escalation portion of the AMpLify phase 1 trial. We plan to provide updates on dose escalation as our AMpLify phase 1 clinical trial advances. CB-012 received fast track and orphan drug designations for r/r AML from the FDA.

Since our founding in 2011, we have devoted substantially all our resources to organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, expanding our genome-editing platform technologies, developing our product candidates and building our pipeline, creating and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, and establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture, testing, and clinical trial evaluations of our product candidates. We do not have any products

Table of Contents
-----------------

approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred operating losses since commencement of our operations.

To date, we have primarily funded our operations through proceeds from the sales of our capital stock, revenue from our license and collaboration agreements, and proceeds from the sale of shares of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. ("Intellia") common stock.

Our net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were $34.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Our net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were $113.6 million and $67.6 million, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $412.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Our net losses and operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending primarily on the timing of expenses associated with our clinical trials and nonclinical studies and our other research and development expenses. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:

* ยท advance clinical trials for our CAR-T cell therapy product candidates;
* ยท continue our current research programs and our preclinical and clinical development of our current product candidates and any other product candidates we identify and choose to develop;
* ยท further develop our genome-editing technologies;
* ยท acquire or in-license new technologies;
* ยท expand, maintain, enforce, and defend our intellectual property portfolio;
* ยท seek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
* ยท establish and expand manufacturing capabilities and supply chain capacity for our product candidates;
* ยท add operational, legal, financial, and management information systems to support growth initiatives;
* ยท hire additional personnel as we advance our product candidates;
* ยท experience any delays, challenges, or other issues associated with any of the above, including the failure of clinical trials meeting endpoints, the generation of unanticipated preclinical study results or clinical trial data subject to differing interpretations, or the occurrence of potential safety issues or other development or regulatory challenges;
* ยท make royalty, milestone, or other payments under current, and any future, in-license or assignment agreements;
* ยท establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval; and
* ยท continue to operate as a public company.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We use multiple contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to individually manufacture, under current good manufacturing processes, our chRDNA guides, Cas9 and Cas12a proteins, plasmids, and adeno-associated virus serotype 6 ("AAV6") vectors used in the manufacture of our cell therapy product candidates as well as the CAR-T cell therapy product candidates themselves. We expect to continue to rely on CMOs for the manufacturing of our preclinical study and clinical trial materials, and most of our current CMOs have capabilities for commercial manufacturing. Additionally, we may decide to bring certain manufacturing functions in house and/or build our own manufacturing facility in the future to provide greater flexibility and control over our clinical and commercial manufacturing needs.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with therapeutic product development, we may never achieve profitability and, unless and until we are able to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to continue to raise additional capital. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through equity offerings (including our at-the-market equity offering program), debt financings, collaborations and strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or other sources. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing to support our business plans as needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise capital as and when needed

or on attractive terms, we may have to significantly delay, reduce, or discontinue the development and commercialization of our product candidates or scale back or terminate our pursuit of new in-licenses and acquisitions.

On July 16, 2024, we announced that we had discontinued preclinical research activities associated with our allogeneic CAR-NK platform and had reduced our workforce by 21 positions, or approximately 12%. This workforce reduction, together with other cost containment measures, is expected to extend our cash runway by at least six months into the second half of 2026, which will enable us to focus resources on our allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and on rapidly advancing our four oncology and autoimmune disease clinical programs through certain milestones expected in 2025. In connection with the workforce reduction, we recorded a total of $0.6 million in non-recurring restructuring charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of cash severance costs, continuation of benefits, and transition support services for impacted employees.

Components of Results of Operations
-----------------------------------

Licensing and Collaboration Revenue
-----------------------------------

We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval and commercialization, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates if we succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates.

To date, all our revenue consists of licensing and collaboration revenue earned from collaboration and/or licensing agreements entered into with third parties, including related parties. Under these agreements, we license rights to certain intellectual property controlled by us. The terms of these arrangements typically include payments to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, upfront license fees or exclusivity fees; annual maintenance fees; regulatory and/or commercial milestone payments; research and development payments; and royalties on the net sales of products and/or services. Each of these payments results in licensing and collaboration revenue. Revenue under such licensing and collaboration agreements was $2.0 million and $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $7.9 million and $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See Notes 4, 5, and 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.

For additional information about our revenue recognition policy related to our licensing and collaboration agreements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K.

For the foreseeable future, we expect substantially all our revenue will be generated from licensing and collaboration agreements.

Operating Expenses
------------------

Research and Development Expenses
---------------------------------

Our research and development expenses consist of internal and external expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates and our platform technologies, and our in-licensing, assignment, and other third-party agreements.

External costs include:

* ยท costs associated with acquiring technology and intellectual property licenses that have no alternative future uses, sublicensing revenues, and milestones;
* ยท costs incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates, including under agreements with CMOs, suppliers, clinical research organizations ("CROs"), and clinical sites; and
* ยท other research and development costs, including laboratory materials and supplies, and consulting services.

Internal costs include:

* ยท personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation expense, for our research and development personnel; and

Table of Contents
-----------------

* ยท allocated facilities and other overhead expenses, including expenses for rent, facilities maintenance, and depreciation.

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs of certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks. However, payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized amounts are recognized as expenses as the goods are delivered or as related services are performed. We separately track certain external costs on a program-by-program basis; however, we do not track costs that are deployed across multiple programs.

Research and development activities are central to our business strategy. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to implement our business strategy; advance our product candidates through clinical trials and later stages of development; conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates; seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; and seek to identify, in-license, acquire, and/or develop additional product candidates.

The successful development of our CAR-T cell therapy product candidates, as well as other potential future product candidates, is highly uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials, and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:

* ยท sufficiency of our financial and other resources;
* ยท acceptance of our CRISPR chRDNA genome-editing technology and other new technologies we may develop or in-license;
* ยท the ability to develop differentiating features so that our products have a competitive edge;
* ยท establishment, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of our patents and other intellectual property rights;
* ยท the ability to not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property rights;
* ยท clearance of IND applications to initiate clinical trials on new product candidates;
* ยท successful enrollment in, and completion of, our clinical trials on our product candidates;
* ยท generation of data from our clinical trials that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates for the intended patient populations and that demonstrate safety and efficacy;
* ยท entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates or for the development of new product candidates;
* ยท successful development of our internal process development and transfer to CMOs;
* ยท maintenance of, and compliance with, our agreements with CMOs and suppliers for clinical and commercial supplies and scaling up manufacturing processes and capabilities to support our clinical trials;
* ยท receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
* ยท grant of regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
* ยท establishment of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities necessary for commercialization of our product candidates if and when approved by the applicable regulatory authorities, whether by us or in collaboration with third parties;
* ยท maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of our products post-approval;
* ยท acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved by the applicable regulatory authorities, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;
* ยท ability of our products to compete with other therapies and treatment options;
* ยท establishment and maintenance of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement; and
* ยท expanded indications and patient populations for our products.

The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated:

| Total research and development expenses | $ 30,421 | $ 28,584 | $ 99,689 | $ 80,796 |

General and Administrative Expenses
-----------------------------------

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, intellectual property costs, consulting costs, and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment depreciation, and utilities. Personnel-related costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our general and administrative personnel. Intellectual property costs include expenses for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents and patent applications, including certain patents and patent applications that we license from third parties. We are entitled to receive reimbursement from third parties of a portion of the costs for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining certain patents and patent applications. We accrue for these reimbursements as the respective expenses are incurred and classify such reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of patent cost reimbursements as a reduction to general and administrative expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of patent cost reimbursements as a reduction to general and administrative expense.

We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of expanding our operations, including preparing for potential commercialization of our product candidates, and additional facility occupancy costs, as well as other expenses necessary to support the growth and operations of a clinical-stage public company.

Other Income
------------

Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and marketable securities and the change in fair value of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ("MSKCC") success payments liability under our Exclusive License Agreement, dated November 13, 2020, with MSKCC ("MSKCC Agreement").

Other income, net increased by $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to a $1.7 million increase in interest income earned from marketable securities.

Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Capital Requirements
------------------------------------------------------

Sources of Liquidity
--------------------

Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have funded our operations through sales of our capital stock, including sales of our convertible preferred stock, which generated approximately $150.1 million in aggregate net proceeds through 2021; from our initial public offering ("IPO") in 2021, which generated approximately $321.0 million in net proceeds; and from our underwritten follow-on public offering in 2023, which generated approximately $134.4 million in net proceeds. We have also received approximately $88.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of Intellia common stock through 2020. Additionally, we received a $25.0 million equity investment from Pfizer through a private placement transaction in June 2023. Through September 30, 2024, we received approximately $99.8 million from licensing agreements, licensing and collaboration agreements, a service agreement, patent assignments, and government grants, including $36.7 million that we received from AbbVie under the now-terminated AbbVie Agreement.

-----------------

On August 9, 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ("Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC, which allows us to, from time to time, sell up to $400.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units comprised of any combination thereof (including the $100.0 million of common stock reserved for our at-the-market equity offering program). The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on August 16, 2022.

On August 9, 2022, we entered into an at-the-market Open Market Sale Agreement ("ATM Sales Agreement") with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement, we may, from time to time, in our sole discretion, issue and sell, through Jefferies, acting as sales agent, up to $100.0 million of our shares of common stock under the Shelf Registration Statement, by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at the market offering" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act. Jefferies uses commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal sales and trading practices to sell shares from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We pay Jefferies a commission equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of any shares sold through Jefferies pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 1,762,806 shares of our common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement, at an average price per share of $7.32 for aggregate gross proceeds of $12.9 million ($12.3 million net of offering expenses). SM

In July and August 2023, we issued and sold a total of 22,115,384 shares of our common stock in an underwritten follow-on public offering at a price to the public of $6.50 per share, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' right to purchase 2,884,615 additional shares of our common stock. The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $143.7 million ($134.4 million net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). The shares were sold under the Shelf Registration Statement.

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $281.0 million. We will continue to be dependent upon equity financing, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements, and/or other forms of capital raises at least until we are able to generate significant positive cash flows from our operations. We have no current ongoing material contractual commitments that are expected to affect our liquidity over the next five years, except for our lease commitments and payments under certain of our agreements with CMOs, suppliers, CROs, clinical trial sites, licensors, assignors, and the like. On April 22, 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in the securities litigation to settle the case for $3.9 million and, on October 15, 2024, the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement pending a final settlement approval hearing. For information regarding our material contractual obligations and commitments and other contingencies, refer to Notes 4, 8, and 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Form 10-Q. We have based these estimates on our current assumptions, which may require future adjustments based on our ongoing business decisions.

Strategic Investment
--------------------

On June 29, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") pursuant to which we issued and sold to Pfizer 4,690,431 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a purchase price of $5.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $25.0 million in a private placement transaction ("Pfizer Investment"). The issuance and sale of the shares to Pfizer closed on June 30, 2023. We granted certain registration rights to Pfizer under the Securities Purchase Agreement covering the resale of the shares. Unless otherwise agreed by Pfizer, we have agreed to use the proceeds from the Pfizer Investment solely in connection with (i) the development program for our allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy known as CB-011 product candidate that is being evaluated in our CaMMouflage clinical trial and/or (ii) any other single-targeted anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy using an anti-BCMA single-chain variable fragment owned or controlled by us (collectively, cell therapies described in clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to as a "BCMA Product Candidate"), for 36 months beginning on June 29, 2023.

On June 29, 2023, in connection with the Pfizer Investment, we and Pfizer also entered into an Information Rights Agreement, having a 36-month term. Under the Information Rights Agreement, we granted Pfizer a 30 calendar day right of first negotiation if we commence or engage with any third party with respect to a potential grant of rights to develop and/or commercialize a BCMA Product Candidate, including, without limitation, a license agreement, a co-promotion/cocommercialization agreement, a profit share agreement, a joint venture agreement, or an asset sale agreement (a "Grant of Program Rights"). If we and Pfizer do not reach an agreement with respect to a Grant of Program Rights within the 30-day period, then we may pursue negotiations and enter into an agreement with any third party. If we and such third party do not

Table of Contents
-----------------

reach agreement on the Grant of Program Rights within a specified time period, Pfizer's right of first negotiation will be reinstated. Under the Information Rights Agreement, we also granted Pfizer the right to designate one representative to serve on our scientific advisory board. Through an information sharing committee, we provide calendar quarter updates to Pfizer regarding the development program for a BCMA Product Candidate. Additionally, we provide Pfizer access to any preclinical or interim or final clinical data (including raw data) and results generated as part of the development program for a BCMA Product Candidate at the same time that we provide such data to a third party (other than to our service providers or the FDA or other regulatory authorities), subject to certain confidentiality exceptions.

Funding Requirements
--------------------

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses and research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:

* ยท the initiation, progress, timing, costs, and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;
* ยท the clinical development plans we establish for our product candidates;
* ยท the number and characteristics of the new product candidates that we develop;
* ยท the outcome, timing, and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
* ยท whether we enter into any collaboration agreements and the terms of any such agreements;
* ยท the cost of filing and prosecuting our patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;
* ยท the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and/or new technologies;
* ยท the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against our products after we receive regulatory approval;
* ยท the effect of competing technological and market developments;
* ยท the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities;
* ยท the cost and timing of completion of clinical-scale and commercial-scale internal manufacturing activities, if we elect to conduct these activities ourselves;
* ยท increases in the number of our employees and expansion of our physical facilities to support growth initiatives;
* ยท the cost of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products without a partner;
* ยท the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval;
* ยท the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments by or to third parties;
* ยท our implementation of various computerized informational systems and efforts to enhance operational systems;
* ยท the impact of public health crises or geopolitical events on our clinical development or operations;
* ยท the impact of inflationary pressures on the cost of our operations; and
* ยท the costs associated with being a public company.

Furthermore, our operating plans may change, and we expect to need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development expenditures.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of human therapeutics, we may never achieve profitability and, unless and until we are able to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to continue to raise additional capital; however, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs, and/or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of equity offerings (including our at-the-market equity offering program), debt financings, collaborations and strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or other sources. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties or other sources, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams, or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

Net cash used in operating activities was $102.7 million and $71.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to our net loss of $113.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $11.7 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. Our non-cash charges were primarily comprised of (i) $12.8 million of stock-based compensation, (ii) $2.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense, (iii) $1.7 million of non-cash lease expense, and (iv) $1.6 million of acquired inprocess research and development; which were partially offset by (i) accretion of discounts on our marketable securities investments of $3.7 million, (ii) change in the fair value of the MSKCC success payments liability of $1.9 million, and (iii) non-cash consideration for licensing and collaboration revenue of $1.6 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to (i) increases of $3.2 million in other assets and $0.4 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and (ii) decreases of $2.2 million in deferred revenue, current and long-term and $0.5 million in operating lease liabilities; partially offset by (i) decreases of $0.6 million in other receivables and $0.6 million in contract assets, and (ii) an increase of $4.3 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

Our non-cash charges were primarily comprised of (i) $10.2 million of stock-based compensation, (ii) $2.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and (iii) non-cash lease expense of $1.6 million; which were partially offset by (i) accretion of discounts on investments of $6.0 million, and (ii) change in the fair value of the MSKCC success payments liability of $0.4 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $0.9 million and decreases of $16.3 million in deferred revenue, current and long-term, and $0.3 million in operating lease liabilities; partially offset by (i) decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.9 million, contract assets of $0.6 million, and (ii) increases of $2.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $1.1 million in accounts payable.

Cash Provided by Investing Activities
-------------------------------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $70.7 million, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $36.7 million.

Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of $325.6 million; partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $248.9 million, property and equipment of $4.4 million, and in-process research and development of $1.6 million.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities
-------------------------------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $12.9 million and $154.3 million, respectively.

Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to net proceeds from our at-the-market equity offering program of $11.3 million, the issuances of common stock under the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") of $0.9 million, and the exercises of stock options of $0.6 million.

Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to $134.5 million of net proceeds from our underwritten follow-on public offering, $17.3 million of net proceeds allocated to the issuances of common stock in a private placement transaction with Pfizer, net proceeds from our at-the-market equity offering program of $1.0 million, and the exercises of stock options and the issuances of common stock under the ESPP of $1.5 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes included in our Form 10-K. Since the date of such financial statements, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Form 10-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
-----------------------------------------

See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
------------------------------------------------------------

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ("JOBS Act"). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (a) are no longer an emerging growth company or (b) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

We expect to use the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an emerging growth company.

We are also a "smaller reporting company." If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been no material changes to our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to the section titled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
--------------------------------

Management's Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, based upon the evaluation described above, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
--------------------------

From time to time, we may become involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse effect on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of our management resources, and other factors.

On April 11, 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against our company and certain of our officers and current and former members of our board of directors, Bergman v. Caribou Biosciences, Inc., et al. , Case Number 23-cv-01742 ("Bergman Case"). The Bergman complaint challenged disclosures regarding our company's business, operations, and prospects, specifically with respect to the alleged durability of CB-010's therapeutic effect and the product candidate's clinical and commercial prospects, in alleged violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On September 18, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the IPO underwriters as defendants and making substantially the same allegations as the original complaint. On November 14, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Motion to dismiss briefing was completed on February 21, 2024. On April 22, 2024, we reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to settle the Bergman Case for $3.9 million in exchange for a full release of the putative class's claims against us and all our current and former officers, current and former members of our board of directors, the IPO underwriters, and the other named defendant. The parties filed a settlement agreement with the court on June 26, 2024, and, on October 15, 2024, the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement and setting a final settlement approval hearing for February 18, 2025.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
----------------------

There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. to Part I of our Form 10-K. The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Use of Proceeds from our IPO
----------------------------

The net proceeds from our IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $28.6 million, were $321.0 million. We are holding a significant portion of the remaining balance of the net proceeds from our IPO in money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury bills, corporate debt securities, and U.S. government agency bonds. There has been no material change in our planned use of the net proceeds from our IPO described in the final prospectus for our IPO filed on July 23, 2021, with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act.

Item 5. Other Information.
--------------------------

On August 13, 2024, Tina Albertson, M.D., Ph.D., our chief medical officer, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as that term is defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408) that is intended to qualify as an "eligible sell-to-cover transaction" (as described in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(D)(3) under the Exchange Act) and is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. This sell-to-cover arrangement applies to restricted stock units or performancebased stock units (collectively, "RSUs"), whether vesting is based on the passage of time and/or the achievement of performance goals, that were previously granted or that could in the future be granted by us from time to time. This arrangement provides for the automatic sale of shares of common stock that would otherwise be issuable on each settlement date of a covered RSU in an amount necessary to satisfy the applicable tax withholding obligations, with the proceeds of the sale delivered to us in satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding obligations. The number of shares of common stock that will be sold under these arrangements is not currently determinable as the number will vary based on the extent to which vesting conditions are satisfied, the market price of our common stock at the time of settlement, and the

-----------------

potential future grant of RSUs subject to this arrangement. The sell-to-cover instructions will remain in place indefinitely unless revoked in writing (including as to any particular sell-to-cover sale) in accordance with their terms.

On September 6, 2024, City Canyon Family Trust, a trust for whichRachel Haurwitz, Ph.D., our president and chief executive officer and a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-trustee along with her husband, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, providing for the sale from time to time of up to540,000 shares of common stock in amounts and at prices determined in accordance with plan terms. The trading arrangement is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The duration of the trading arrangement is until December 12, 2025, or earlier if all transactions under the trading arrangement are completed.

Except as described above, no other director or Section 16 officeradopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as that term is defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
