On April 11, 2022, the Company's shares started trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the "Nasdaq") under the trading symbol WBD.

The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&T's shareholders via a pro rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. (See Note 2 and Note 3.) Prior to the Merger, WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. ("WMH") distributed $40.5 billion to AT&T (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WM's retention of certain debt. Discovery transferred purchase consideration of $42.4 billion in equity to AT&T shareholders in the Merger. In August 2022, the Company and AT&T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, pursuant to section 1.3 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2 billion payment from AT&T in the third quarter of 2022 in lieu of adjusting the equity issued as purchase consideration in the Merger. AT&T shareholders received shares of WBD Series A common stock ("WBD common stock") in the Merger representing 71% of the combined Company and the Company's pre-Merger shareholders continued to own29% of the combined Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis.

Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the WM Business for accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"); therefore, Discovery is considered the Company's predecessor and the historical financial statements of Discovery prior to April 8, 2022, are reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of the Company as of and for any periods prior to April 8, 2022 do not include the financial results of the WM Business and current results will not be comparable to historical results.

Labor Disruption
----------------

The Writers Guild of America ("WGA") and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA") went on strike in May and July 2023 following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ("AMPTP"). The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA remains on strike. As a result of the strikes, we have paused and may continue to pause certain theatrical and television productions, which has resulted in delayed production spending.

The strikes have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. This includes a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the remainder of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company's ability to produce, license, and deliver content. We continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact to our business; however, the full effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained, including variable interest entities ("VIE") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.

The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or future periods. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the "2022 Form 10-K").

There have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies described in the 2022 Form 10-K.

Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements Adopted
-----------------------------------------------

Supplier Finance Programs
-------------------------

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for supplier finance program obligations. This guidance provides specific authoritative guidance for disclosure of supplier finance programs, including key terms of such programs, amounts outstanding, and where the obligations are presented in the statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods, except for the disclosure of roll forward information, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Certain components of this guidance must be applied retrospectively, while others may be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2023 and has provided the required disclosures in Note 14.

NOTE 2. EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
-------------------------------------

Common Stock Issued in Connection with the WarnerMedia Merger
-------------------------------------------------------------

In connection with the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A common stock, Discovery Series B convertible common stock, and Discovery Series C common stock, was reclassified and automatically converted into one share of WBD common stock, and each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A-1 convertible preferred stock ("Series A-1 Preferred Stock") and Series C-1 convertible preferred stock was reclassified and automatically converted into 13.1135 and 19.3648 shares of WBD common stock, respectively.

The Merger required the consent of Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership under Discovery's certificate of incorporation as the sole holder of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. In connection with Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership's entry into the consent agreement and related forfeiture of the significant rights attached to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in the reclassification of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into common stock, it received an increase to the number of shares of common stock of the Company into which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted. The impact of the issuance of such additional shares of common stock was $789 million and was recorded as a transaction expense in selling, general and administrative expense upon the closing of the Merger in the three months ended June 30, 2022.

On April 8, 2022, the Company issued1.7 billion shares of WBD common stock as consideration paid for the acquisition of WM. (See Note 3.)

Earnings Per Share
------------------

All share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification and automatic conversion into WBD common stock, except for Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which has not been recast because the conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into WBD common stock in connection with the Merger was considered a discrete event and treated prospectively.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
-------------------------------------

Acquisitions
------------

WarnerMedia
-----------

On April 8, 2022, the Company completed its Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T. The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&T's shareholders via a pro-rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of WM.

The Merger combined WM's content library of popular and valuable intellectual property with Discovery's global footprint, collection of local-language content and deep regional expertise across more than 220 countries and territories. The Company expects this broad, worldwide portfolio of brands, coupled with its DTC potential and the attractiveness of the combined assets, to result in increased market penetration globally. The Merger is also expected to create significant cost synergies for the Company.

The following table summarizes the components of the aggregate purchase consideration paid to acquire WM (in millions).

| Fair value of WBD common stock issued to AT&T shareholders (1) | 42,309 |

Balances reflect rounding of dollar and share amounts to millions, which may result in differences for recalculated standalone amounts compared with the amounts presented above. In August 2022, the Company and AT&T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, pursuant to section 1.3 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2 billion payment from AT&T in the third quarter of 2022.

Purchase Price Allocation
-------------------------

The Company applied the acquisition method of accounting to WM, whereby the excess of the fair value of the purchase price paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill reflects the assembled workforce of WM as well as revenue enhancements, cost savings and operating synergies that are expected to result from the Merger. The goodwill recorded as part of the Merger has been allocated to the Studios, Networks and DTC reportable segments in the amount of $9,308 million, $7,074 million and $5,727 million, respectively, and is not deductible for tax purposes.

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company finalized the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments were reflected in the period in which the adjustments occurred. Adjustments recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $368 million, primarily related to taxes, and were recorded in other noncurrent assets, deferred income taxes, and other noncurrent liabilities, with an offset to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measurement period adjustments, and a reconciliation to total consideration transferred is presented in the table below (in millions).

| | Preliminary April 8, 2022 | Measurement Period Adjustments | Final April 8, 2022 |

| Film and television content rights and games | 28,729 | (344) | 28,385 |
| Property and equipment | 4,260 | 13 | 4,273 |
| Goodwill | 21,513 | 596 | 22,109 |
| Intangible assets | 44,889 | 100 | 44,989 |
| Other noncurrent assets | 5,206 | 283 | 5,489 |
| Current liabilities | (10,544) | 12 | (10,532) |
| Debt assumed | (41,671) | (9) | (41,680) |
| Deferred income taxes | (13,264) | 492 | (12,772) |
| Other noncurrent liabilities | (8,004) | (940) | (8,944) |
| Total consideration paid | $ 42,376 | $ - | $ 42,376 |

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using several valuation approaches including, but not limited to, various cost approaches and income approaches, such as relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings, and with-or-without methods.

NOTE 10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
-----------------------------------------

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate market risk and interest rate fluctuations. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, fixed-to-fixed currency swaps, total return swaps and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency, market value and interest rate exposures. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings volatility by offsetting gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. The Company does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Derivatives Designated for Hedge Accounting
-------------------------------------------

Cash Flow Hedges
----------------

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to revenues, production rebates and production expenses and fixedto-fixed cross-currency swaps to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with its British Pound Sterling denominated debt. In April 2023, the Company unwound crosscurrency swaps related to its Sterling debt and recognized a gain of $76 million as an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The Sterling debt was subsequently redesignated as a net investment hedge effective May 2023.

The following table presents the pre-tax impact of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on income and other comprehensive loss (in millions).

If current fair valu es of designated cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2023 remained static over the next twelve months, the amount the Company would reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income in the next twelve months would not be material for the current fiscal year. The maximum length of time the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 32 years.

Net Investment Hedges
---------------------

The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled its Euro denominated debt that was designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, to mitigate the currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities, the Company re-designated its Sterling denominated debt due in 2024 as a net investment hedge after the unwind of the cash flow hedge previously noted.

The following table presents the pre-tax impact of derivatives designated as net investment hedges on other comprehensive loss (in millions). Other than amounts excluded from effectiveness testing, there were no other material gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company issued $1.5 billion of 6.412% fixed rate senior notes due March 2026. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to allow the Company to mitigate the variability in the fair value of its senior notes due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the senior note and the interest rate swap are recorded in interest expense, net.

Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting
-----------------------------------------------

Prior to the Merger, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk associated with the expected issuance of debt related to the Merger. To mitigate this risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps and subsequently unwound them prior to the Merger.

As part of the Merger, the Company acquired deferred compensation plans that have risk related to the fair value gains and losses on these investments and entered into total return swaps to mitigate this risk. The gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the deferred compensation investment gains and losses.

The Company is exposed to risk of secured overnight financing rate changes in connection with securitization interest paid on the receivables securitization program. To mitigate this risk, the Company entered into $6.0 billion notional of non-designated interest rate swaps. The gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting securitization interest expense.

Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated as production spend occurs or when rebate receivables are recognized. After de-designation, gains and losses on these derivatives directly impact earnings in the same line as the hedged risk.

In addition to the financial instruments listed in the tables above, the Company holds other financial instruments, including cash deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, term loans, and senior notes. The carrying values for such financial instruments, other than the senior notes, each approximated their fair values as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding senior notes, including accrued interest, using quoted prices from over-the-counter markets, considered Level 2 inputs, was $36.8 billion and $38.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 10, its investments with readily determinable fair value are discussed in Note 8, and the obligation for its revolving receivable program is discussed in Note 6.

NOTE 12. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
---------------------------------

The Company has various incentive plans under which performance based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"), service based restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and stock options have been issued. The table below presents awards granted (in millions, except weighted-average grant price).

| | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | Awards | Weighted-Average Grant Price |
| Awards granted: | | |
| PRSUs | 4.0 | $ 15.41 |
| RSUs | 28.5 | $ 14.89 |
| Stock options | 2.2 | $ 15.02 |

The table below presents unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based awards and the weighted-average amortization period over which these expenses will be recognized as of September 30, 2023 (in millions, except years).

| | Unrecognized Compensation Cost | Weighted-Average Amortization Period (years) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRSUs | $ 37 | |
| RSUs | 576 | |
| Stock options | 128 | |
| Total unrecognized compensation cost | $ | 741 |

NOTE 13. INCOME TAXES
---------------------

Income tax benefit was $125 million and $563 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and income tax benefit was $566 million and $1,201 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The decrease in income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax book income. The decrease was partially offset by an unfavorable tax adjustment related to the preferred stock conversion transaction expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 associated with the Merger.

Income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the effect of foreign operations, changes in uncertain tax positions, and state and local income taxes.

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company's reserves for uncertain tax positions totaled $2,191 million and $1,929 million, respectively. The increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to tax reserves that were recorded in 2023 through purchase accounting related to the Merger, partially offset by tax reserves released in 2023 upon audit resolutions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company's uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $77 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments.

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $558 million and $413 million, respectively, of total interest and penalties payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The increase in the interest and penalties accrual as of September 30, 2023 includes interest and penalty accruals recorded in 2023 through purchase accounting related to the Merger. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

| Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | $ 2,430 | $ 3,930 |

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
------------------------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment monitoring procedures for all of its reporting units and identified no indicators of impairment or triggering events. Due to declining levels of global GDP growth, disruption in the film and television industry, a weakening advertising market associated with the Company's Networks reporting unit, and execution risk associated with anticipated growth in the Company's DTC reporting unit, the Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for changes that could impact recoverability.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reassessed the useful lives and amortization methods for its linear networks and HBO trademarks and trade names and concluded the pattern of amortization should be accelerated. Accordingly, the Company has changed the amortization method for these assets from the straight-line method to the sum-of-the-months' digits method effective July 1, 2023. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of $171 million.

Assets Held for Sale
--------------------

In 2022, the Company classified its Ranch Lot and Knoxville office building and land as assets held for sale. The Company reclassified $ 209 million to prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet during 2022 and stopped recording depreciation on the assets. The Knoxville office building and land was sold during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the Ranch Lot was sold during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Burbank Studios Lot was purchased during the three months ended September 30, 2023 in exchange for the Ranch Lot and cash.

Supplier Finance Programs
-------------------------

Consistent with customary industry practice, the Company generally pays certain content producers at or near the completion of the production cycle. In these arrangements, content producers may earn fees upon contractual milestones to be invoiced at or near completion of production. In these instances, the Company accrues the content in progress in accordance with the contractual milestones. Certain of the Company's content producers sell their related receivables to a bank intermediary who provides payments that coincide with these contractual production milestones upon confirmation with the Company of our obligation to the content producer. This confirmation does not involve a security interest in the underlying content or otherwise result in the payable receiving seniority with respect to other payables of the Company. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has confirmed $266 million and $273 million, respectively, of accrued content producer liabilities. These amounts were outstanding and unpaid by the Company and were recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, given the principal purpose of the arrangement is to allow producers access to funds prior to the typical payment due date and the arrangement does not significantly change the nature of the payables and does not significantly extend the payment terms beyond the industry norms. Invoices processed through the program are subject to a one-year maximum tenor. The Company does not incur any fees or expenses associated with the paying agent services, and this service may be terminated by the Company or the financial institution upon 30 days' notice. At, or near, the production completion date (invoice due date), the Company pays the financial institution the stated amounts for confirmed producer invoices. These payments are reported as cash flows from operating activities.

Noncontrolling Interest
-----------------------

In August 2023, the Company and JCOM Co., Ltd. ("JCOM") executed a series of transaction agreements to which the Company and JCOM each contributed to Discovery Japan, Inc. ("JVCo"), an existing 80/20 joint venture between the Company and JCOM, certain rights, liabilities, or rights via license agreements in exchange for new common shares of JVCo, resulting in the Company and JCOM owning 51% and 49% of JVCo, respectively. Retaining controlling financial interest subsequent to the transaction, the Company continues to consolidate the joint venture. As the terms of the agreement no longer incorporate JCOM's option to put its noncontrolling interest to the Company, JCOM's noncontrolling interest was reclassified from redeemable noncontrolling interest to noncontrolling interest outside of stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
------------------------------------

The table below presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes (in millions).

NOTE 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
-----------------------------------

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties. Related parties include entities that share common directorship, such as Liberty Global plc ("Liberty Global"), Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband") and their subsidiaries (collectively the "Liberty Group"). The Company's Board of Directors includes Dr. John Malone, who is Chairman of the Board of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and beneficially owns approximately 30% and 48% of the aggregate voting power with respect to the election of directors of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband, respectively. The majority of the revenue earned from the Liberty Group relates to multi-year network distribution arrangements.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
--------------------------------------

Put Rights
----------

The Company has granted put rights to non-controlling interest holders in certain consolidated subsidiaries, but the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment.

In 2022, GoldenTree exercised its irrevocable put right for MotorTrend Group LLC ("MTG"), and the Company will be required to purchase GoldenTree's32.5% noncontrolling interest. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, the process of determining fair market value based on the procedures required under the joint venture agreement was finalized. The Company expects to complete its purchase of GoldenTree's 32.5% interest during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Legal Matters
-------------

From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners or intellectual property. However, a determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's future consolidated financial position, future results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 17. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
----------------------------

The Company's operating segments are determined based on: (i) financial information reviewed by its chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis upon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Company's, except that certain inter-segment transactions that are eliminated for consolidation are not eliminated at the segment level. Inter-segment transactions primarily include advertising and content licenses. The Company records inter-segment transactions of content licenses at the gross amount. The Company does not report assets by segment because it is not used to allocate resources or evaluate segment performance.

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:

* · employee share-based compensation;
* · depreciation and amortization;
* · restructuring and facility consolidation;
* · certain impairment charges;

WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.
----------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
------------------------------------------

(unaudited)

* · gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;
* · certain inter-segment eliminations;
* · third-party transaction and integration costs;
* · amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;
* · amortization of capitalized interest for content; and
* · other items impacting comparability.

The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The tables below present summarized financial information for each of the Company's reportable segments and inter-segment eliminations (in millions).

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additional context can also be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the "2022 Form 10-K").

INDUSTRY TRENDS
---------------

The WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike in May and July 2023 following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the AMPTP. The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA remains on strike. As a result of the strikes, we have paused and may continue to pause certain theatrical and television productions, which has resulted in delayed production spending.

The strikes, together with other headwinds in the industry, such as continued pressures on linear distribution and soft advertising markets in the U.S., have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. This includes a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the remainder of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company's ability to produce, license, and deliver content, and declines in linear advertising revenue attributed to secular trends and soft advertising markets in the U.S.

We continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact to our business; however, the full effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
-----------------

Warner Bros. Discovery is a premier global media and entertainment company that combines the WarnerMedia Business's premium entertainment, sports and news assets with Discovery's leading non-fiction and international entertainment and sports businesses, thus offering audiences a differentiated portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, streaming and gaming. Some of our iconic brands and franchises include Warner Bros. Pictures Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, DC, HBO, Max, Discovery Channel, discovery+, CNN, HGTV, Food Network, TNT, TBS, TLC, OWN, Warner Bros. Games, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Game of Thrones, and The Lord of the Rings.

We are home to a powerful creative engine and one of the largest collections of owned content in the world and have one of the strongest hands in the industry in terms of the completeness and quality of assets and intellectual property across sports, news, lifestyle, and entertainment in virtually every region of the globe and in most languages. Additionally, we serve audiences and consumers around the world with content that informs, entertains, and, when at its best, inspires.

Our asset mix positions us to drive a balanced approach to creating long-term value for shareholders. It represents the full entertainment eco-system, and the ability to serve consumers across the entire spectrum of offerings from domestic and international networks, premium pay-TV, streaming, production and release of feature films and original series, related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.

In May 2023, we launched Max, our enhanced streaming service. Max combines HBO Max and discovery+ content to create a unique and complete viewing experience for consumers by combining our unrivaled breadth and superior quality of content and brands with iconic franchises and strong product experience. discovery+ will continue to be available to consumers.

In connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. The Company finalized the framework supporting its ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives during the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. While the Company's restructuring efforts are ongoing, this restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024. We expect to incur approximately $4.1 - $5.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges, of which we have incurred $4.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. Of the total expected pre-tax restructuring charges, we expect total cash expenditures to be $1.0 - $ 1.5 billion.

As of September 30, 2023, we classified our operations in three reportable segments:

* · Studios Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to third parties and our networks/DTC services, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.
* · Networks Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.
* · DTC Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services.

Our segment presentation is aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------

The discussion below compares our actual results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2022, as well as our actual results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to our pro forma combined results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as if the Merger occurred on January 1, 2021. Management believes reviewing our pro forma combined operating results in addition to actual operating results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. Our Studios, Networks, DTC, Corporate, and inter-segment eliminations information is based on the historical operating results of the respective segments and include, where applicable, adjustments for (i) additional costs of revenues from the fair value step-up of film and television library, (ii) additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, (iii) additional depreciation expense from the fair value of property and equipment, (iv) transaction costs and other one-time non-recurring costs, (v) additional interest expense for borrowings related to the Merger and amortization associated with fair value adjustments of debt assumed, (vi) changes to align accounting policies, (vii) elimination of intercompany activity, and (viii) associated tax-related impacts of adjustments.

Adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the combined businesses since January 1, 2021 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations.

Foreign Exchange Impacting Comparability
----------------------------------------

In addition to the Merger, the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-FX"), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the "2023 Baseline Rate"), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2023 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

NM - Not meaningful
-------------------

Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion below through operating loss reflects results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 on a pro-forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenues, and selling, general and administrative expenses are substantially attributable to the Merger. The percent changes of line items below operating loss in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in U.S. dollars.

Revenues
--------

Distribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, DTH satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and DTC subscribers. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution rights to our networks from cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. From time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to re-set subscriber rates, which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years. In some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks.

Distribution revenue increased 1% and was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to new DTC partnership launches and higher U.S. contractual affiliate rates, partially offset by declines in linear subscribers in the U.S. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, declines in linear subscribers in the U.S. were offset by higher U.S. contractual affiliate rates and new DTC partnership launches.

Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites), and sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, the stage of development of television markets, and the popularity of FTA television. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital platforms on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.

Advertising revenue decreased 13% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, soft advertising markets in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, certain international markets, partially offset by Max U.S. ad-lite subscriber growth and higher engagement. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by the prior year broadcast of the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, partially offset by the broadcast of the Stanley Cup Finals in the current year.

Content revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, SVOD and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.

Content revenue increased 11% and 1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie and higher games revenue due to the current year releases of Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy , partially offset by lower TV licensing revenue. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher games revenue due to the release of Hogwarts Legacy and higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie , partially offset by lower TV licensing revenue, the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, and home entertainment revenue.

Other revenue primarily consists of studio production services and tours.

Other revenue increased 17% and 20% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports joint venture, the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023, and continued strong attendance at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London and Hollywood.

Costs of Revenues
-----------------

Our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television/digital series, specials, films, games, and sporting events. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs.

Costs of revenues decreased 6% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to lower content expense at Studios (for television products), DTC, and Networks, partially offset by higher content expense for theatrical and games products. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to lower content expense at Studios (for television products) and DTC, the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, and the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship in 2022, partially offset by higher games content expense.

Selling, General and Administrative
-----------------------------------

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy, and back office support fees.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 12% and 19% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to more efficient marketing-related spend and a reduction in personnel costs, partially offset by higher theatrical and games marketing expense.

Depreciation and Amortization
-----------------------------

Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization decreased 12% and increased 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized using the sum of the months' digits method. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized using the sum of the months' digits method, which resulted in lower pro forma amortization in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Restructuring and other charges
-------------------------------

In connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. Restructuring and other charges were primarily attributable to contract terminations, facility consolidation activities, organizational restructuring, and other charges and decreased 82% and 79% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Impairments and Loss on Dispositions
------------------------------------

Impairments and loss on dispositions was $24 million and $61 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Interest Expense, net
---------------------

Actual interest expense, net increased $19 million and $500 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to debt assumed as a result of the Merger. (See Note 9 and Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Loss From Equity Investees, net
-------------------------------

Actual losses from our equity method investees were $14 million and $73 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The changes are attributable to our share of earnings and losses from our equity investees. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Other (Expense) Income, net
---------------------------

The table below presents the details of other (expense) income, net (in millions).

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |

| Total other (expense) income, net | $ (63) | $ (28) | $ (109) | $ 411 |

Income Tax Benefit
------------------

Income tax benefit was $125 million and $563 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and income tax benefit was $566 million and $1,201 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The decrease in income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax book income. The decrease was partially offset by an unfavorable tax adjustment related to the preferred stock conversion transaction expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 associated with the Merger.

Income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the effect of foreign operations, changes in uncertain tax positions, and state and local income taxes.

Segment Results of Operations
-----------------------------

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:

* · employee share-based compensation;
* · depreciation and amortization;
* · restructuring and facility consolidation;
* · certain impairment charges;
* · gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;
* · certain inter-segment eliminations;
* · third-party transaction and integration costs;
* · amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;
* · amortization of capitalized interest for content; and
* · other items impacting comparability.

The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA by segment (in millions).

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | |

The discussion below reflects results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.

Revenues
--------

Content revenue increased 3% and decreased 10% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie and higher games revenue due to the current year releases of Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy , partially offset by lower TV licensing revenue due to certain large TV licensing deals in the prior year and the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to lower TV licensing and home entertainment revenue, partially offset by higher games revenue due to the release of Hogwarts Legacy and higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie . TV licensing revenue decreased due to certain large TV licensing deals in the prior year, the timing of TV production, including the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, fewer series sold to our owned platforms, fewer CW series, and the mix of theatrical availabilities. Home entertainment revenue decreased due to fewer new releases of theatrical products.

Other revenue increased 5% and 13% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023 and continued strong attendance at Warner Bros Studio Tour London and Hollywood. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

Costs of Revenues
-----------------

Costs of revenues increased 1% and decreased 12% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher content expense for theatrical and games products commensurate with higher revenues, partially offset by lower television product content expense, including the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to lower television product content expense, including the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, partially offset by higher content expense for games and theatrical products commensurate with higher revenues.

Selling, General and Administrative
-----------------------------------

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21% and 9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher theatrical marketing expense due to the increased quantity of films released. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher theatrical marketing expense due to the increased quantity of films released and higher games marketing expense to support the release of Hogwarts Legacy .

Adjusted EBITDA
---------------

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% and 17% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The discussion below reflects our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.

Revenues
--------

Distribution revenue decreased 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to a decline in linear subscribers in the U.S., partially offset by higher U.S. contractual affiliate rates.

Advertising revenue decreased 13% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, soft advertising markets in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, certain international markets. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by the broadcast of the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, partially offset by the broadcast of the Stanley Cup Finals in the current year.

Content revenue decreased 22% and 26% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the timing of third-party content licensing deals in the U.S. and lower international sports sublicensing, partially offset by intersegment content licensing to DTC. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributed to the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, lower international sports sublicensing, and, to a lesser extent, timing of third-party content licensing deals in the U.S., partially offset by inter-segment licensing of content to DTC.

Other revenue increased 51% and 54% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports joint venture.

Costs of Revenues
-----------------

Costs of revenues decreased 6% and 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to lower international and regional sports networks content expense, and lower domestic general entertainment related expense, partially offset by higher costs associated with the unconsolidated TNT Sports joint venture. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe and the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship in 2022, partially offset by higher domestic sports related expense.

Selling, General and Administrative
-----------------------------------

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% and 4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to lower marketing and personnel expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA

The discussion below reflects results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general, and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.

Revenues
--------

As of September 30, 2023, we had 95.1 million DTC subscribers. 1

Distribution revenue increased 5% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable tonew partnership launches, price increases in the U.S. and certain international markets, the launch of the Ultimate tier in the U.S., and favorable mix shifts from wholesale to higher revenue channels.

Advertising revenue increased 29% and 28% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to Max U.S. ad-lite subscriber growth and higher engagement.

Content revenue decreased 17% and increased 40% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher third-party licensing for HBO content in September 2022. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the timing of certain licensing deals.

Costs of Revenues
-----------------

Costs of revenues decreased 12% and 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to lower content expense. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by increased content licensing costs commensurate with higher content revenue, partially offset by the shutdown of CNN+ in the prior year.

We may refer to the aggregate number of DTC Subscriptions as "subscribers".

The reported number of "subscribers" included herein and the definition of "DTC Subscription" as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, and Max, that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) a limited number of international discovery+ subscribers that are part of nonstrategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic and international Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a DTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next month as noted above.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
---------------------------------------------

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 46% and 37% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to more efficient marketing-related spend.

Adjusted EBITDA

Corporate operations primarily consist of executive management and administrative support services, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense, as well as substantially all of our share-based compensation and third-party transaction and integration costs.

As reported transaction and integration costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included the impact of the issuance of additional shares of common stock to Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership of $789 million upon the closing of the Merger. (See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Adjusted EBITDA improved 4% and 16% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,primarily attributable to reductions to personnel costs and technology-related operating expenses and lower securitization expense, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense.

Inter-segment Eliminations

Inter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and promotion activity between reportable segments. In our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution activities are in different segments. Inter-segment content transactions are presented "gross" (i.e. the segment producing and/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate "Eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment distributing the content, e.g. via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including "mark-ups" and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. The content amortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate "Eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

Liquidity
---------

Sources of Cash
---------------

Historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2023, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We are a well-known seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice, subject to market conditions. Access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. We have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program described below. We also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring program described below.

· Debt
------

Senior Notes
------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued $1.5 billion of 6.412% fixed rate senior notes due March 2026. After March 2024, the senior notes are redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper
----------------------------------------------

We have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") and have the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility"). We may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2023, DCL was in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Additionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed and repaid $4,298 million and $4,304 million, respectively, under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program.

· Revolving Receivables Program
-------------------------------

We have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5,500 million of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. We service the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pay fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. As customers pay their balances, our available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically we transfer additional receivables into the program. In some cases, we may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. The outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was $5,190 million as of September 30, 2023.

· Accounts Receivable Factoring
-------------------------------

We have a factoring agreement to sell certain of our non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. Total trade accounts receivable sold under our factoring arrangement was $72 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

· Derivatives
-------------

We received investing proceeds of $38 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Uses of Cash
------------

Our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel costs, costs to develop and market our enhanced streaming service Max, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes and term loan, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock.

· Content Acquisition
---------------------

We plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights. Contractual commitments to acquire content have not materially changed as set forth in "Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2022 Form 10-K. However, our spending to acquire content may be lower than we initially anticipated due to temporary pauses of certain theatrical and television productions as a result of the recently concluded WGA strike and the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.

· Debt
------

Term Loan
---------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repaid$2,850 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our term loan prior to the due date of April 2025.

Floating Rate Notes
-------------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we completed a tender offer and purchased $460 million of aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes prior to the due date of March 2024.

Senior Notes
------------

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased or repaid $2,378 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due in 2023 and 2024. In addition, we have $42 million of senior notes coming due in December 2023, and an additional $1,261 million of senior notes coming due through September 30, 2024.

We may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or purchase our other outstanding indebtedness through prepayments, redemptions, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase or exchange any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or exchanges will be determined at our discretion.

· Capital Expenditures and Investments in Next Generation Initiatives
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We effected capital expenditures of $1,048 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including amounts capitalized to support Max. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and market Max.

· Investments and Business Combinations
---------------------------------------

Our uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We also provide funding to our investees from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we contributed $91 million for investments in and advances to our investees.

· Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling Interest
----------------------------------------------------------------

Due to business combinations, we had redeemable equity balances of $281 million at September 30, 2023, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. In 2022, GoldenTree exercised its put right and we are required to purchase GoldenTree's noncontrolling interest. (See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests totaled $282 million and $286 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

· Income Taxes and Interest
---------------------------

We expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made cash payments of $1,191 million and $2,065 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively. Cash required for interest payments has increased significantly as a result of the Merger.

Cash Flows
----------

The following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions).

| | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period | $ | 3,930 | $ 3,905 |
| Cash provided by operating activities | | 3,899 | 1,458 |
| Cash (used in) provided by investing activities | | (1,025) | 3,742 |
| Cash used in financing activities | | (4,308) | (6,470) |
| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | | (66) | (122) |
| Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | | (1,500) | (1,392) |
| Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period | $ | 2,430 | $ 2,513 |

Operating Activities
--------------------

Cash provided by operating activities was $3,899 million and $1,458 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity.

Investing Activities
--------------------

Cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(1,025) million and $3,742 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to cash acquired from the Merger in the prior year, less proceeds received from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments and sales of investments, and increased purchases of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Financing Activities
--------------------

Cash used in financing activities was $4,308 million and $6,470 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to less net debt activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Capital Resource s
------------------

As of September 30, 2023, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).

| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Total Capacity | Outstanding Indebtedness | Unused Capacity |
| Cash and cash equivalents | $ 2,383 | $ - | $ 2,383 |
| Revolving credit facility and commercial paper program | 6,000 | - | 6,000 |
| Term loans | 1,150 | 1,150 | - |
| Senior notes (a) | 43,937 | 43,937 | - |
| Total | $ 53,470 | $ 45,087 | $ 8,383 |

We expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under the Credit Agreements will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.

The 2017 Tax Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.

Summarized Guarantor Financial Information
------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation
---------------------

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all of the Company's outstanding $13.5 billion registered senior notes have been issued by DCL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks, and WMH. As of September 30, 2023, the Company also has outstanding $29.3 billion of senior notes issued by WMH and guaranteed by the Company, Scripps and DCL; $1.2 billion of senior notes issued by the legacy WarnerMedia Business (not guaranteed); and approximately $23 million of un-exchanged senior notes issued by Scripps Networks (not guaranteed).

MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM KNOWN CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the normal course of business, we enter into commitments for the purchase of goods or services that require us to make payments or provide funding in the event certain circumstances occur. Contractual commitments have not materially changed as set forth in "Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2022 Form 10-K.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
--------------------------

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily the Liberty Group and our equity method investees. (See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
------------------------------------------

Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed since December 31, 2022. For a discussion of each of our critical accounting estimates listed below, including information and analysis of estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2022 Form 10-K:

* · Uncertain tax positions;
* · Goodwill and intangible assets;
* · Content rights;
* · Consolidation; and
* · Revenue recognition

NEW ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

We adopted certain new accounting and reporting standards during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. (See Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies, integration of acquired businesses, new service offerings, financial prospects and anticipated sources and uses of capital. Words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "future," "intend," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "strategy," "target" and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like "could," "may," "might," "should," "will" and "would," among other terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. Where, in any forwardlooking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. The following is a list of some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:

* · potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences or unforeseen increased expenses associated with the WarnerMedia Business or our efforts to integrate the WarnerMedia Business;
* · inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial forecasts;
* · our level of debt, including the significant indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the WarnerMedia Business, and our future compliance with debt covenants;
* · more intense competitive pressure from existing or new competitors in the industries in which we operate;
* · reduced spending on domestic and foreign television advertising, due to macroeconomic trends, industry trends or unexpected reductions in our number of subscribers;
* · industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, sports programming, feature film, television and television commercial production;
* · market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries;
* · negative publicity or damage to our brands, reputation or talent;
* · uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and provision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies, and the success of our streaming services;
* · realizing direct-to-consumer subscriber goals;
* · general economic and business conditions, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and political unrest in the international markets in which we operate;
* · the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike, including the recently concluded WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, player lock-outs or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union, athletes or others involved in the development and production of our sports programming, television programming, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements;
* · disagreements with our distributors or other business partners;
* · continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios;
* · theft of our content and unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibition of such content;
* · threatened or actual cyber-attacks and cybersecurity breaches; and
* · changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, laws and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and similar authorities internationally and data privacy regulations and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings.

These risks have the potential to impact the recoverability of the assets recorded on our balance sheets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Additionally, many of these risks are amplified by and may, in the future, continue to be amplified by the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of any forward-looking statements we make, cannot be foreseen with certainty and are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and global economies and regulatory environments, factors specific to Warner Bros. Discovery, and other factors described under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our 2022 Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about our existing market risk are set forth in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," in the 2022 Form 10-K. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2022.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures.
--------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
------------------------------------------------

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
--------------------------

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
-------------------------

From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners or intellectual property. However, a determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.

Between September 23, 2022 and October 24, 2022, two purported class action lawsuits (Collinsville Police Pension Board v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv08171; Todorovski v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09125) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints named Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., Discovery, Inc., David Zaslav, and Gunnar Wiedenfels as defendants. The complaints generally alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements in SEC filings and in certain public statements relating to the Merger, in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On November 4, 2022, the court consolidated the Collinsville and Todorovski complaints under case number 1:22-CV-8171, and on December 12, 2022, the court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Advance/Newhouse Partnership and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (collectively, "Advance/Newhouse"), Steven A. Miron, Robert J. Miron, and Steven O. Newhouse as defendants. The amended complaint continues to assert violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and seeks damages and other relief. On April 7, 2023, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend these litigations.

On December 2, 2022, a purported class action and derivative lawsuit (Monroe County Employees' Retirement System, Plumbers Local Union No. 519 Pension Trust Fund, and Davant Scarborough v. David M. Zaslav, et al., Case No. 2022-1115-JTL) was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Monroe County Action"). The Monroe County Action named certain of the Company's directors and officers, Advance/Newhouse and AT&T as defendants. The Monroe County Action generally alleged that former directors and officers of Discovery and Advance/Newhouse breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, and that AT&T aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The Monroe County Action sought damages and other relief.

Also on December 2, 2022, a separate purported class action lawsuit (Bricklayers Pension Fund of Western Pennsylvania v. Advance/Newhouse Partnership, Case No. 2022-1114-JTL) was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Bricklayers Action"). The complaint in the Bricklayers Action names Advance/Newhouse and certain of the Company's current and former directors as defendants and generally alleges that former directors of Discovery and Advance/Newhouse breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger, and that Advance/Newhouse aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The Bricklayers Action seeks damages and other relief.

On January 11, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated the Monroe County Action and the Bricklayers Action under the caption In re Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Stockholders Litigation, Consolidated Case No. 2022-1114-JTL. On March 9, 2023, the court appointed the plaintiffs which filed the Bricklayers Action lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action. On April 5, 2023, the court approved a stipulated briefing schedule, and the remaining defendants in the case (Advance/Newhouse, Robert Miron, Steven Miron, and Susan Swain) responded to the complaint originally filed in the Bricklayers Action on May 31, 2023.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
---------------------

Investors should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as set forth under Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of the Company's 2022 Form 10-K. Certain of the risks described in our 2022 Form 10-K and Q2 Form 10-Q are amended and restated as set forth below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
------------------------------------------

Our businesses may be subject to labor disruption.
--------------------------------------------------

We and some of our suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, announcers, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of our television programs, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns, work stoppages, or the possibility of such actions, including the recently concluded WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and potential strikes by other unions involved in development and production, have resulted in, and could in the future result in, delays in the production of, or the release of, our television programs, feature films, and interactive entertainment. For example, the recently concluded WGA strike and ongoing SAGAFTRA strike have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, delays in the production of our television programs and feature films and in the release of certain programming. The impact of these strike-related delays and the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike in general could continue to be felt even after the SAG-AFTRA strike is resolved.

If our industry experiences prolonged strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages, we may be unable to produce, distribute or license programming, feature films, and interactive entertainment, which could result in reduced revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the recently concluded WGA strike and ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Business Overview-Industry Trends." In addition, the pausing and restarting of productions may result in incremental costs, delay the completion and release of some of our content (films, television programs, and licensed programs) and could cause an impairment of our investment in film, television programs, or licensed program rights if the incremental costs are significant or we are unable to efficiently complete the production of the film, television show or program or decide to abandon the production.

We could also enter into new collective bargaining agreements or renew collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms and incur higher costs as a result of prolonged strikes, work slowdowns, or work stoppages. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industrywide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude us from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact our promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 5. Other Information
-------------------------

Disclosure of Trading Arrangements
----------------------------------

Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K requires the Company to disclose whether any director or officer of the Company has adopted or terminated (i) any trading arrangement that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c); and/or (ii) any written trading arrangement that meets the requirements of a "non-Rule 10b51 trading arrangement" as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the following activity occurred requiring disclosure under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K:

Bruce Campbell, Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer, adopted a new Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement on September 11, 2023. This trading arrangement has a termination date of March 3, 2025.
