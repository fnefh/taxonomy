1. Basis of Presentation

---

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited. AMETEK, Inc. (the "Company") believes that all adjustments (which primarily consist of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024, the consolidated results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been included. Quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company's annual period ending December 31, 2024, and for interim periods within the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The amendments in this ASU will be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. ASU 2023-07 will require additional disclosures in the Reportable Segments footnote, but will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), which improves income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The ASU indicates that all entities will apply its guidance prospectively with an option for retroactive application to each period in the financial statements. The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2023-09 may have on the Company's financial statement disclosures.

1. Revenues

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $324.8 million and $297.7 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities.

Contract assets are reported as a component of Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

Product Warranties
------------------

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary among the Company's operations, but the majority do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. Product warranty obligations are reported as a component of Accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheet.

Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows:

Accounts Receivable
-------------------

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses, on all accounts receivable and contract assets, which considers risk of future credit losses based on factors such as historical experience, contract terms, as well as general and market business conditions, country, and political risk. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had $968.2 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances of $14.3 million. Changes in the allowance were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

1. Earnings Per Share

---

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Weighted average shares: | | | | |
| Basic shares | 231,342 | 230,691 | 231,292 | 230,431 |
| Equity-based compensation plans | 882 | 1,060 | 896 | 983 |
| Diluted shares | 232,224 | 231,751 | 232,188 | 231,414 |

The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 excluded an immaterial number of stock options because the exercise prices of these stock options exceeded the average market price of the Company's common shares, and the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. There were no antidilutive shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

1. Fair Value Measurements

---

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company's own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table provides the Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consistent with the fair value hierarchy, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Table of Contents

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Mutual fund investments | $ 10,910 | $ 10,910 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | 1,489 | - | 1,489 | - |
| | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |

| Mutual fund investments | $ 11,922 | $ 11,922 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | 2,035 | - | 2,035 | - |

The fair value of mutual fund investments is based on quoted market prices. The mutual fund investments are shown as a component of investments and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant.No transfers between level 1 and level 2 investments occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Foreign Currency
----------------

At September 30, 2024, the Company had a Euro forward contract for a total notional value of65.0 million Euros. The foreign currency forward contract is valued as a level 2 liability as it is corroborated by foreign currency exchange rates and shown as a component of other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, realized and unrealized gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts were not significant.

Financial Instruments
---------------------

Cash, cash equivalents and mutual fund investments are recorded at fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The following table provides the estimated fair values of the Company's financial instrument liabilities, for which fair value is measured for disclosure purposes only, compared to the recorded amounts at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Recorded Amount | Fair Value | Recorded Amount | Fair Value |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Long-term debt (including current portion) | (1,917,123) | $ (1,855,522) | (2,197,538) | $ (2,087,607) |

The fair value of net short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value. The Company's net long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of net long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and is considered a level 3 liability.

1. Hedging Activities

---

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of September 30, 2024, these net investment hedges included British-pound-and Euro-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in certain designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges are evidenced by management's contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any

gain or loss on the hedging instruments (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the hedged investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had $301.4 million of British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $565.4 million in Euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $19.0 million of pre-tax currency remeasurement losses have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

1. Acquisitions

---

The initial accounting for the December 2023 Paragon Medical acquisition has been adjusted, including the measurement of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, as well as the associated income tax considerations. The adjustments include an increase to goodwill of $60.8 million, a decrease to fixed assets of $40.7 million, a decrease to intangibles of $21.7 million, a decrease to inventory and other of $11.3 million, and a decrease to income taxes of $12.9 million. Any further adjustments are not expected to be material to the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet. The Company is in the process of finalizing the value of intangible assets, inventory, and accounting for income taxes.

The Company finalized its measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities for its August 2023 acquisition of United Electronic Industries, which had no material impact to the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet. The Company is in the process of finalizing the accounting for income taxes for its October 2023 acquisition of Amplifier Research Corp.

Acquisition Subsequent to September 30, 2024

In October 2024, the Company acquired Virtek Vision International ("Virtek"). Virtek has estimated annual sales of approximately $40 million. Virtek is a leading provider of advanced laser-based projection and inspection systems. Virtek will join EIG.

1. Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by segment were as follows:

Table of Contents

| | EIG | EMG | Total |

| | (In millions) | (In millions) | (In millions) |
| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $ 4,365.0 | $ 2,082.6 | $ 6,447.6 |
| Purchase price allocation adjustments and other | 25.5 | 61.2 | 86.7 |

| Balance at September 30, 2024 | $ 4,399.9 | $ 2,150.4 | $ 6,550.3 |

1. Income Taxes

---

At September 30, 2024, the Company had gross uncertain tax benefits of $271.5 million, of which $205.6 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax

rate.

The following is a reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions (in millions):

| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $ 233.5 |
| --- | --- |
| Additions for tax positions | 40.0 |
| Reductions for tax positions | (2.0) |
| Balance at September 30, 2024 | $ 271.5 |

The additions above primarily reflect the tax positions for foreign tax planning initiatives. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The amounts recognized in income tax expense for interest and penalties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was18.8%, compared with 17.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher year over year tax cost on foreign sourced income.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $43.1 million. The total fair value of stock options vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $14.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $19.3 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the 0.6 million non-vested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.

Restricted Stock

The following is a summary of the Company's non-vested restricted stock activity and related information:

| | Shares (In thousands) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-vested restricted stock outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 296 | $ 135.39 |
| Granted | 148 | 181.60 |
| Vested | (141) | 132.77 |
| Forfeited | (22) | 153.79 |
| Non-vested restricted stock outstanding at September 30, 2024 | 281 | $ 159.52 |

The total fair value of restricted stock vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $ 18.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $32.3 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the0.3 million non-vested restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.

Performance Restricted Stock Units
----------------------------------

In March 2024, the Company granted performance restricted stock units ("PRSU") to officers and certain key management-level employees. The PRSUs vest over a period up to three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to which the Company achieves certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1 of the year of grant to December 31 of the third year. Half of the PRSUs were valued in a manner similar to restricted stock as the financial targets are based on the Company's operating results, which represents a performance condition. The grant date fair value of these PRSUs are recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the probable number of awards to vest at each reporting date.

The other half of the PRSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is related to the Company's total shareholder return compared to a group of peer companies, which represents a market condition. The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of these awards as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

1. Contingencies

---

Asbestos Litigation
-------------------

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Certain of these lawsuits relate to a business which was acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company. In connection with these lawsuits, the seller of such business has agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the "Indemnified Claims"). The Indemnified Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such seller. The seller has met its obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such party would fail to fulfill its obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously.

Environmental Matters
---------------------

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At September 30, 2024, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") at 12 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the "non-owned" sites). The Company is identified as a "de minimis" party in a majority of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. The Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established to satisfy the Company's expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the "owned" sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company's liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $30.6 million and $37.1 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $7.8 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $14.3 million on environmental matters for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters.

The Company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above, which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. In the opinion of management, based on presently available information and the Company's historical experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Information contained in this discussion, other than historical information, is considered "forward-looking statements" and is subject to various factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. These factors and uncertainties include risks related to the Company's ability to consummate and successfully integrate future acquisitions; risks associated with international sales and operations, including supply chain disruptions; the Company's ability to successfully develop new products, open new facilities or transfer product lines; the price and availability of raw materials; compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations; changes in the competitive environment or the effects of competition in the Company's markets; the ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources; and general economic conditions affecting the industries the Company serves. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect the Company's future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Such evaluation did not identify any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
