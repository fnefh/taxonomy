Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions
Basis of Presentation
When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our," "PepsiCo" and the "Company" mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries, collectively.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2023 has been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting
principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). This report
should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024 are not necessarily indicative
of the results expected for any future period or the full year.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning,
inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished
product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
While our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international
operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12
weeks ended September 7, 2024 and September 9, 2023, and the months of January through August are reflected in our results for the 36
weeks ended September 7, 2024 and September 9, 2023.
The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and
economic uncertainty resulting from volatile geopolitical conditions and changes in the interest rate and inflationary cost environment
have made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those
estimates.
Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and
certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an
estimated annual effective tax rate.
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share
amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior
year's financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

(a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, was 37% and 36% of our
consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, respectively, and 36% of our consolidated net revenue in the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 9,
2023. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners
for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.

Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Adopted

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective for the current fiscal year 2024. We will adopt the rollforward guidance when it becomes effective in our 2024 annual reporting, on a prospective basis. See Note 12 for disclosures currently required under this guidance.

Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance transparency of income tax disclosures. On an annual basis, the new guidance requires a public entity to disclose: (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) additional information for reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (3) income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with foreign taxes disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid, (4) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and (5) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between federal (national), state and foreign. The guidance is effective for fiscal year 2025 annual reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2025 annual reporting, on a prospective basis.

In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance disclosure of expenses of a public entity’s reportable segments. The new guidance requires a public entity to disclose: (1) on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss), including a description of its composition, (3) on an annual and interim basis, information about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets previously required to be disclosed only on an annual basis, and (4) the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources. The new guidance also clarifies that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss, one or more of those measures may be reported and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures. The guidance is effective for the current fiscal year 2024 annual reporting, and in the first quarter of 2025 for interim period reporting, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in our 2024 annual reporting.

**Note 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges**

**2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan**

We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineers our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplifies our organization and optimizes our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.

The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

| Expected pre-tax charges | FLNA | QFNA | PBNA | LatAm | Europe | AMESA | APAC | Corporate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | 10 % | 1 % | 30 % | 10 % | 25 % | 5 % | 4 % | 15 % |

<sup>(a)</sup> Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.
<sup>(b)</sup> Issued through our wholly-owned consolidated finance subsidiary, PepsiCo Singapore Financing I Pte. Ltd., which has no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the notes and any other notes that may be issued in the future. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PepsiCo, Inc. on a senior unsecured basis and may be assumed at any time by PepsiCo, Inc. as the primary and sole obligor.

The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.

In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, $1.3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes, €1.0 billion of euro-denominated senior notes and C$0.8 billion of Canadian dollar-denominated senior notes matured and were paid.

As of September 7, 2024, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, excluding discounts.

In the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2029. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $5.0 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $5.75 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, up to two times during the term of the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $4.2 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.

Also in the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 23, 2025. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $5.0 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $5.75 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $4.2 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.

Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of September 7, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.

Note 9 - Financial Instruments
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
• commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
• foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
• interest rates.
In 2024, we included the use of cross-currency contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our net investment in foreign
operations in our hedging strategies.
In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of
$500 million for Chinese renminbi and maturity dates ranging from November 2025 to November 2029. The cross-currency interest rate
swaps are designated as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign operations with Chinese renminbi functional
currency.
We use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency
interest rate swaps attributable to spot exchange rate changes are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common
shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment to offset changes in the value of the net investments being hedged. These
amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated.
Excluded components in the form of interest accruals are recorded in net interest expense and other.
Cash flows associated with the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are
classified within investing activities.
There have been no other material changes during the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024 with respect to our risk management policies
or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if
our credit rating is at A2 (Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for
possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-
related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of September 7, 2024 was $171 million. We have posted no collateral
under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of September 7, 2024.
The notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023 are as
follows:

<tr>

## Debt Securities

### Held-to-Maturity

As of September 7, 2024, we had $46 million of investments in foreign government treasury held-to-maturity debt securities recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 30, 2023, we had $309 million of investments in commercial paper held-to-maturity debt securities recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.

### Available-for-Sale

There were no material impairment charges related to investments in available-for-sale debt securities in both the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024 and September 9, 2023. There were unrealized gains of $347 million as of September 7, 2024 and no unrealized gains or losses as of September 9, 2023 related to investments in available-for-sale debt securities. Related to our Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius), we recorded an unrealized loss of $453 million and $265 million in other comprehensive income during the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, respectively. Additionally, we recorded a decrease in the investment of $7 million and $14 million due to cash dividends received during the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, respectively. There were no Level 3 investments in available-for-sale debt securities during the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023.

### TBG Investment

In the 36 weeks ended September 9, 2023, we recorded our proportionate 39% share of TBG's impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity method investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $113 million ($86 million after-tax or $0.06 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. There were no impairment charges recorded in the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024.

(a) Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.
(b) Includes Level 2 assets of $184 million and Level 3 assets of $877 million as of September 7, 2024, and Level 2 assets of $178 million and Level 3 assets of $1,156 million as of December 30, 2023. As of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023, $1,061 million and $1,334 million were classified as other assets, respectively. The fair values of our Level 2 investments approximate the transaction price and any accrued returns, as well as the amortized cost. The fair value of our Level 3 investment in Celsius is estimated using probability-weighted discounted future cash flows based on a Monte Carlo simulation using significant unobservable inputs such as an 80% probability that a certain market-based condition will be met and an average estimated discount rate of 5.8% and 8.1% as of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on Celsius' estimated synthetic credit rating. An increase in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or a decrease in the discount rate would result in a higher fair value measurement, while a decrease in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement.
(c) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.
(d) Based primarily on the price of our common stock.
(e) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees' investment elections.
(f) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.
(g) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.
(h) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.

The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was $42 billion and $41 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

Losses/(gains) on our cash flow hedges are categorized as follows:

Note 12 - Supply Chain Financing Arrangements

We maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. As of September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023, $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements. For further information on the key terms of these supply chain financing programs, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Note 13 - Subsequent Event

On October 1, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Garza Food Ventures LLC, doing business as Siete Foods, a Mexican-American foods business, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the acquisition date. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Closing is expected in the first half of 2025.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided
as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock
per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on
unrounded amounts.
Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Total Marketplace Spending
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes
sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a
reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are
based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may
occur after year end once reconciled and settled.
These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with
respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual
incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition,
certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim
reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales
incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period's actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted
annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and
the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a
similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities.
Income Taxes
In determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected
annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the
various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax
positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized
in the quarter in which they occur.
Our Business Risks
This Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Reform Act

are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as "aim," "anticipate," "believe," "drive," "estimate," "expect,"
"expressed confidence," "forecast," "future," "goal," "guidance," "intend," "may," "objective," "outlook," "plan," "position,"
"potential," "project," "seek," "should," "strategy," "target," "will" or similar statements or variations of such words and other
similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments
that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These
forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and
trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any
such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict
in Ukraine; future demand for PepsiCo's products; damage to PepsiCo's reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or
concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCo's ability to compete effectively; PepsiCo's ability to attract, develop and
maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail
landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCo's manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued
increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political, social or geopolitical conditions in the markets
where PepsiCo's products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCo's ability to grow its business in developing and
emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other
disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCo's reliance on third-
party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change and other sustainability
matters; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCo's productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and
underlying assumptions regarding future performance of our business or investments that can result in impairment charges; fluctuations
or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo's credit ratings; imposition or proposed
imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo's products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCo's
products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with
personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax
authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo's intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others;
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory
proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our Business Risks," included in
our 2023 Form 10-K and in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our
Business Risks" of this Form 10-Q. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.
Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain
During the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we continued to experience higher operating costs, including on transportation
and labor costs, which may continue for the remainder of 2024. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of
our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk
through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures.
A number of external factors, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions,
supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, have impacted and
28

# Table of Contents

may continue to impact transportation and labor costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our
customers, which may result in reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.

See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in
our 2023 Form 10-K for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.

**Risks Associated with Climate Change**

Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing,
new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of
greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with
initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and
equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations
and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor
existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to
consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.

**Risks Associated with International Operations**

In the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of June, July and August. In
the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, our financial results outside of North America reflect the months of January through August. In
the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue, with
Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa comprising approximately 25% of our consolidated net
revenue. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold. In the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net revenue
performance by 2 percentage points primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. In the 36 weeks
ended September 7, 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 1 percentage point primarily due to declines in
the Egyptian pound and Russian ruble, partially offset by an appreciation of the Mexican peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar
which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.

In addition, volatile economic, political, social and geopolitical conditions, civil unrest and wars and other military conflicts, acts of
terrorism and natural disasters and other catastrophic events in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed
or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, continue to result in
challenging operating environments and have resulted in and could continue to result in changes in how we operate in certain of these
markets. Debt and credit issues, currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets (including restrictions on the
transfer of funds to and from certain markets), as well as the threat or imposition of new or expanded tariffs, sanctions or export controls
have also continued to impact our operations in certain of these international markets. We continue to closely monitor the economic,
operating and political environment in the markets in which we operate, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs and
currency devaluation, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Our operations in
Russia accounted for 5% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue during the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, respectively.

Table of Contents
Russia accounted for 4% of our consolidated assets, including 8% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and 33% of our
accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of September 7, 2024.
See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the fair values of our financial instruments as of
September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion
of these items.
**Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products**
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing,
new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or
substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their
packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some
taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar).
Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the
sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or
restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we
sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot
predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore
cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations
may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in
which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the
unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the
imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
**OECD Global Minimum Tax**
Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the OECD model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15%.
Certain countries have enacted legislation incorporating the agreed global minimum tax effective in 2024. Legislation incorporating the
agreed global minimum tax enacted as of September 7, 2024 is not expected to have a material impact on our 2024 financial statements.
More countries are expected to enact similar legislation, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax by 2025. As
legislation becomes effective in more countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision
for income taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by countries and evaluate the potential impact on
our business in future periods.
**Retail Landscape**
Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce
websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations
among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-
commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek
to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer
business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any
unfavorable impacts on our future results.

# Page 33 of 53

Table of Contents
The retail industry also continues to be impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result consolidation of
ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin
America. We have seen and expect to continue to see retailers and buying groups impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions. We
continue to monitor our relationships with retailers and buying groups and seek to identify actions we may take to maintain mutually
beneficial relationships and resolve any significant disputes and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
Cautionary statements included above and in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Our Business Risks" in our 2023 Form 10-K should be considered when evaluating our trends and
future results.
Results of Operations – Consolidated Review
Consolidated Results
Volume
Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the
preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional
information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends and provides additional
transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. See "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Financial Results - Volume" included in
our 2023 Form 10-K for further information on volume. Unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures.
Acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other
structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Further,
unit volume growth excludes the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53rd reporting week), where applicable.

See "Results of Operations - Division Review" for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
12 Weeks
Operating profit decreased 4% and operating margin decreased 0.5 percentage points. Operating profit performance was primarily driven
by certain operating cost increases, a decline in organic volume, a 4-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring charges and a 3-
percentage-point impact of net mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives. These impacts were partially offset by effective net
pricing and productivity savings.

36 Weeks
Operating profit increased 3% and operating margin increased slightly. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net
pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a decline in organic volume.

12 Weeks
Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $21 million, primarily reflecting settlement charges related to certain U.S.
and international defined benefit plans and the recognition of special termination benefits due to restructuring actions as part of our 2019
Productivity Plan, partially offset by the recognition of gains on plan assets and impact of discretionary plan contributions.
Net interest expense and other increased $18 million, due to higher interest rates on debt, lower average cash balances and higher average
debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on average cash balances and higher gains on the market value of investments used
to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability.
The reported tax rate increased 0.7 percentage points, primarily as a result of an intercompany tax loss in the prior year, partially offset
by the release of a tax reserve in a foreign jurisdiction in the current year.
36 Weeks
Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $28 million, primarily reflecting the recognition of special termination
benefits due to restructuring actions as part of our 2019 Productivity Plan and settlement charges related to certain U.S. and international
defined benefit plans, partially offset by the recognition of gains on plan assets and impact of discretionary plan contributions.
Net interest expense and other increased $53 million, due to higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances, partially
offset by higher average cash balances, higher interest rates on average cash balances and higher gains on the market value of
investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability.
The reported tax rate decreased 0.6 percentage points, primarily reflecting the release of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction in
the current year.
Results of Operations – Division Review
While our financial results in North America are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a
monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended September 7,
2024 and September 9, 2023, and the months January through August are reflected in our results for the 36 weeks ended September 7,
2024 and September 9, 2023.

In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, "effective net pricing" reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing
actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.
See "Our Business Risks," "Non-GAAP Measures" and "Items Affecting Comparability" for a discussion of items to consider when
evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with GAAP.
Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth
Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on this measure, see "Non-GAAP Measures."

(a) Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue performance differs from the unit volume change
disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses,
temporary timing differences between bottler case sales and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE). We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses
based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.
(c) Net revenue decline was impacted by the Quaker Recall.

**Non-GAAP Measures**
Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-Q allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and "Items Affecting Comparability" for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q.

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below:

Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth rates

These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures,

impairment and other charges/credits, product recall-related impact and the impact of settlement losses related to pension and retiree
medical plans (see "Items Affecting Comparability" for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on
operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a
constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based
on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as
appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as
appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in
evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that
we believe impact comparability with the prior year.

Organic revenue growth

We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures
and where applicable, the impact of the 53rd reporting week. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in
evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we
believe impact comparability with the prior year.

See "Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth" in "Results of Operations - Division Review" for further information.

Free cash flow

We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since
net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a
recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash
from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments,
dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain
non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.

See "Free Cash Flow" in "Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further information.

See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial
statements in our 2023 Form 10-K, for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan.

We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our
condensed consolidated financial statements.

**Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges**

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures,
primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

**Impairment and Other Charges/Credits**

We recognized impairment charges related to our investment in TBG and as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of
previously recorded amounts.

**Product Recall-Related Impact**

We recognized property, plant and equipment write-offs, employee severance costs and other costs in our QFNA division associated with
a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.

See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

**Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact**

Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual
service and interest costs.

See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

**Our Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines
and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to
meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of
liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash
equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt
repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual
commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund
other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See "Our
Business Risks" and Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q and "Item 1A. Risk Factors,"
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our Business Risks" and Note 8 to
our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K for further information.

As of September 7, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls
or currency exchange restrictions were not material.

The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of September 7, 2024, our
mandatory transition tax liability was $1.7 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. See "Our
Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K for further
discussion of the TCJ Act.

Supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we
do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. See Note 12 to
our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.

## Operating Activities

During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 billion, compared to net cash provided
by operating activities of $7.6 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working
capital comparisons.

## Investing Activities

During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, net cash used for investing activities was $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting net capital
spending.

We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital
spending needs.

## Financing Activities

During the 36 weeks ended September 7, 2024, net cash used for financing activities was $5.3 billion, primarily reflecting the return of
operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.1 billion, payments of long-term debt
borrowings of $2.9 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $0.3 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuances of
long-term debt of $4.0 billion.

We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On
February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common
stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2024, we announced a
7% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.42 per share from $5.06 per share, effective with the dividend paid in June 2024. We expect
to return a total of approximately $8.2 billion to shareholders in 2024, comprising dividends of approximately $7.2 billion and share
repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion.

## Free Cash Flow

The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free
cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see "Non-GAAP Measures."

<table border="1">

  <tr>
    <td>Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure</td>
    <td>$ 3,547</td>
    <td>$ 5,224</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends while maintaining Tier 1 commercial
paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at
favorable interest rates. See "Our Business Risks" included in this Form 10-Q and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our

Business Risks," included in our 2023 Form 10-K, for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a
result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access
capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit
ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,
and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated
financial statements and "Our Business Risks" included in this Form 10-Q, as well as "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Our Business Risks" included in our 2023
Form 10-K for further information.
Changes in Line Items in Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Changes in line items in the income statement are discussed in "Results of Operations - Consolidated Review," "Results of Operations
Division Review" and "Items Affecting Comparability."
Changes in line items in the cash flow statement are discussed in "Our Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Changes in line items in the balance sheet are discussed below:
Total Assets
Total assets were $100.5 billion as of both September 7, 2024 and December 30, 2023. Assets were impacted primarily by the following
line items:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>(Decrease)/Increase<sup>(a)</sup></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cash and cash equivalents <sup>(b)</sup></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>$ (2.4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Accounts and notes receivable, less allowance <sup>(c)</sup></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>$ 1.3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Total Liabilities
As of September 7, 2024, total liabilities were $80.9 billion, compared to $81.9 billion as of December 30, 2023. The change in total
liabilities is primarily driven by the following line item:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th>(Decrease)/Increase<sup>(a)</sup></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Accounts payable and other current liabilities <sup>(d)</sup></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>$ (1.3)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

(a) In billions.
(b) Refer to the cash flow statement for further information.
(c) Primarily reflects favorable operating performance.
(d) Primarily reflects timing of payments, combined with a decrease in capital expenditure payables.
Total Equity

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 7, 2024,
the related Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, and Equity for the twelve and thirty-six weeks
ended September 7, 2024 and September 9, 2023, the related Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the thirty-six weeks
ended September 7, 2024 and September 9, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial
information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 30, 2023, and the related Consolidated Statements of
Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated
February 8, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information
consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
See “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks.” In addition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business Risks” and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect we will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the 12 weeks ended September 7, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan.

We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations.

See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2023 Form 10-K.
