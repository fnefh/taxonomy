PART I
ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, primarily operates, franchises, and develops casual dining restaurants in North America famous
for serving more than two dozen craveable, high-quality burgers with Bottomless Steak Fries® and sides in a fun environment welcoming to Guests of all ages.

We opened the first Red Robin® restaurant in Seattle, Washington in September 1969. In 1979, the first franchised Red Robin restaurant was opened in Yakima,
Washington. In 2001, we formed Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and consummated a reorganization of the Company. Since that time, Red
Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. has owned, either directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding capital stock or membership interests, respectively, of Red Robin
International, Inc. and our other operating subsidiaries through which we operate our Company-owned restaurants. Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, references to "Red Robin," "we," "us," "our", or the "Company" refer to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.

As of the end of our fiscal year on December 25, 2022, there were 511 Red Robin restaurants, of which 414 were Company-owned and 97 were operated by
franchisees. Our franchisees are independent organizations to whom we provide certain support. See "Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements" for additional
information about our franchise program. As of December 25, 2022, there were Red Robin restaurants in 38 states and one Canadian province.

The Company operates its business as one operating and one reportable segment. Financial information for our operating segment is included in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company's fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the last Sunday of the calendar year. We refer to our fiscal years as 2022, 2021, and 2020 throughout this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal years, fiscal year end dates, and the number of weeks in each period are summarized in the table below:

**Restaurant Concept**

With our menu of Gourmet Burgers and American favorites, attractive atmosphere, and playful environment that connects friends and family, our brand not only carries great memories for our most loyal Guests but also appeals to a broad demographic. Our Guests seek connection with friends and family across a diverse and multi-generational demographic.

We pride ourselves on our Gourmet Burgers and other mainstream favorites served in a casual, playful atmosphere. Our menu features our signature product, a line of Gourmet Burgers made from premium quality, fresh ground beef. To complement our best-selling Gourmet Burgers, we offer an everyday-value line of Red's Tavern Double® burgers, and Red Robin's Finest line made with premium toppings. We also offer burgers made with other proteins including chicken breasts (grilled or fried), turkey patties, as well as a proprietary vegetarian patty and the Impossible™ plant-based burger patty. We offer a selection of buns, including gluten free, sesame, brioche, and lettuce wraps, with a variety of toppings, including house-made sauces, crispy onion straws, sautéed mushrooms, several cheese choices, and a fried egg. All of our burgers are served with our all-you-can-eat Bottomless Steak Fries® or Guests may choose from other side options. We specialize in customizing our menu items to meet our Guests' dietary needs and preferences and have received recognition from experts in the allergen community. In addition to burgers, which accounted for 61% of food sales in 2022, Red Robin serves an array of other mainstream favorites that appeal to our Guests. These items include a variety of foods like Donatos® pizza, wings, salads, other entrees, and desserts. We also offer a range of single-serve and shareable desserts as well as our milkshakes. Our beverages include signature alcoholic and non-alcoholic specialty drinks, cocktails, wine, and a variety of national and craft beers.

We strive to customize the pace of the experience for our Guests based on their occasion, from accommodating time-pressured meals to offering a place to relax and connect with family and friends. We call this the "gift of time." Red Robin also has an extraordinary approach to Guest service, and we have cataloged thousands of stories of Red Robin Team Members who live our values. Many examples can be found on our website, www.redrobin.com. Note that our website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference herein, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

We also strive to provide our Guests with exceptional dining value and the ability to customize their experience. In 2022, we had an average check per Guest of $15.99. Average Guest check increased 10.5% compared to 2021. We believe our price-to-value relationship, featuring our innovative array of quality burgers, served with bottomless fries, differentiates us from our casual dining competitors and allows us to appeal to a broad base of middle income, multi-generational consumers.

**ESG: Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability**

Red Robin is a company that cares; we strive to make the world a better place for our Team Members, our community, and our planet. We are beginning to undertake a more formal and robust sustainability journey with meaningful goals and a commitment to align with the industry and are informed by experts including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (the "SASB"). We will continue to adapt our sustainability approach in 2022, we published our first sustainability report, which is available on our website at ir.redrobin.com. The contents of the sustainability report and our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.

**Human Capital Management**

We strive to ensure our people, who we refer to as Team Members, live out and benefit from our core values: Integrity, Fun, Unbridled Hospitality, and High Performance. We believe that when we live out these values, we win together!

Winning together is our core objective. We nurture this culture by ensuring that our people are front and center, that they have a clear understanding of what is expected, and that people love working for our brand. We strive to provide our people with a great place to work, opportunities for growth, and competitive compensation for their contributions. Our values empower and motivate our Team Members and create a Company culture that we collectively take pride in every day. We also provide

our Team Members the opportunity to grow and develop, promote health and safety, and value inclusion, diversity, and engagement.
As part of our human capital management strategy, we focus on the following areas:
Our Team Members
As of December 25, 2022, we had 24,335 Team Members consisting of 23,908 Team Members at Company-owned restaurants and 427 Restaurant Support Center
and field-based Team Members. We focus on General Manager tenure in restaurants and its positive link to Guest traffic, overall Guest satisfaction, and Team Member
turnover trends. Our General Manager turnover during 2022 was 20.9%, and 72.0% of General Managers have been managing their current restaurant for a year or more.
None of our Team Members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We support our Team Members by offering market-competitive compensation and benefits for eligible Team Members. Tip eligible Team Members are paid at
least the tip credit rate or minimum wage rate as mandated by federal, state, or local government agencies, in addition to receiving customer tips. We aim to ensure
tipped positions make more than the federal, state, or local minimum wage when including tips. Our benefit programs include medical, dental, and vision insurance
offerings, employee assistance programs, shift meals, Red Robin meal discounts, paid time off, 401(k) with employer match, an employee stock purchase plan, and
equity-based awards for eligible Restaurant Support Center and operations Team Members, generally, at the director level and above.
Our compensation and performance evaluation systems are designed to compensate our Team Members fairly for their level of experience, team effort, and overall
contribution to our business. We leverage our rewards to motivate our Team Members to do what is necessary in our mission to deliver a best-in-class Guest experience.
For our field operations leaders we anticipate implementing a new performance-based manager compensation program. Our individual restaurant managers and multi-
restaurant operators, are now referred to as "Managing Partners" and "Market Partners," respectively. Under our new 2023 plan we expect each Partner will earn a base
salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant's operating profit. We expect to change our legacy program
because we believe that providing each Partner with a significant stake in our business will attract and retain the best talent in the industry. We also believe that this
program rewards our Partners for making the right day-to-day decisions to satisfy our Guests and meet our financial objectives.
Health and Safety
We operate with the health, safety, and well-being of Red Robin's Team Members, Guests, and communities in mind, as well as federal, state and local regulatory
requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took additional measures to protect our Team Members and Guests from infectious disease as well as comply with
state and local protocols designed to maintain a healthy work environment.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DE&I")
At Red Robin, our Guests and Team Members reflect the communities we serve and can always come as they are. We champion a culture of inclusion, diversity of
thought, perspective and experience, all vital ingredients of a winning recipe. We have a successful Women's Excellence program, a Company-wide resource group to
support and inspire Team Members through development, networking, leadership, and other resources while fueling a culture of opportunity and diversity. In 2022, we
established a 10-member Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council to develop a long-term strategy and plan for our Company. This group meets on a monthly basis to
assess opportunities for the Company to improve its efforts to create a best-in-class work environment that thrives on inclusion and diversity of thought. This Council
meets with our Executive Team and Board of Directors on a periodic basis to provide recommendations and updates on our progress against our evolving DE&I
objectives.
Restaurant Management
From 2020 through 2022, our typical restaurant management team consisted of a General Manager, an assistant General Manager, one to two associate managers,
and additional shift supervisors depending on restaurant sales volumes. We believe it is critical to operate our restaurants with a full complement of experienced,
professional, and salaried restaurant management. Beginning in 2023, we anticipate changing the typical restaurant management team to consist of a Managing Partner,
an assistant General Manager, a kitchen manager, and associate managers or shift supervisors as appropriate dependent primarily on restaurant Sales volume. We expect
this transition in restaurant management will occur in phases. This transition marks a major change in our operational approach for the future. Expectations for local
restaurant leadership will be to "own" all aspects of the profit and loss of the restaurant. Decision making on a number of P&L related activities will now be driven by
local leadership with the support of multi-unit field operations leaders when appropriate. In support of this approach the compensation plan for field restaurant leaders
will change significantly. A larger portion of the total compensation package for Managing Partners will be in the form of a monthly bonus linked to restaurant-level
operating profit. Leaders who are effective

at driving higher levels of monthly operating profit will receive higher monetary rewards. This model also supports our intent to improve our level of community focus
within the local regions we serve. Managing Partners will have the flexibility and resources to drive localized activities aimed at nurturing relationships within the
community to drive Guest traffic. It is our expectation that this approach will help to drive both top and bottom-line results.

The management team of each restaurant is responsible for the day-to-day operation of that restaurant, including hiring, training, and coaching of Team Members,
as well as operating results. Our typical restaurant employs approximately 57 Team Members, most of whom work part-time on an hourly basis.

## Learning and Development

We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the training and development of Team Members and the establishment of, and
adherence to, high standards relating to Team Member performance, Guest satisfaction, food and beverage preparation, and the maintenance of our restaurants. Each
restaurant maintains a group of certified learning coaches, including a head learning coach, who collectively are tasked with preparing new Team Members for success
by providing on-the-job training leading up to a final skills certification for their position. Team Members seeking advancement have the opportunity to join our
management development program as a Shift Supervisor. We continue to focus on hiring, training, and retaining our Team Members as we believe this is key to
maintaining quality and consistency in each of our restaurants.

New restaurant managers participate in our eight-week Management Foundations training program. This program hones each manager's skills, specifically in two
areas: flawless shift execution and effective coaching of Team Members.

These learning and development practices at the restaurants support our talent pipeline to develop and promote our restaurant management Team Members from
within.

## Team Member Engagement

We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve Team Member experience and identify opportunities to strengthen our culture. We welcome open,
candid feedback to ensure Team Members feel heard and engaged and to better support the values important to each of our Team Members. We accomplish this through
a variety of programs and forums, including town halls, virtual open forums, and one-on-one coaching, wellness and engagement meetings, and Team Member Voice
surveys. In addition to these structured programs and forums, we maintain an open-door policy at all levels of the Company. Our Company remains committed to
offering Team Members numerous opportunities to have their voices heard because we believe our Team Members are our most valuable resource.

In late 2022, we partnered with an outside vendor to launch a new Team Member engagement survey across our enterprise. Launch is set for mid-2023. We plan to
use this information to gather insights from our Team Member population and identify opportunities to better meet their needs. We plan to offer the use of this survey
tool multiple times during the year to gain feedback when key events occur, so we can quickly respond to suggestions and concerns when they arise. We believe that
such a tool will not only assist us with workforce retention, but also enhance labor productivity over time.

## Food Safety and Purchasing

Our food safety and quality assurance programs help manage our commitment to safe, quality ingredients and responsible food preparation and service. Our Food
Safety Management Program is a set of systems designed to protect from risk and control hazards. We provide detailed specifications for our proprietary food
ingredients, products, and supplies to our suppliers. We qualify and require outside third party certification audits on an annual basis for all of our food and beverage
suppliers, as well as growers. Their certifications must comply with the Global Food Safety Initiative, if applicable. Our restaurant leaders must pass and maintain an
accredited manager-level food safety and sanitation certification. Strict food safety protocols, including safe cooking temperature requirements, food handling
procedures, cooling procedures, and frequent temperature and quality checks, ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve in our restaurants. In order to provide the
freshest ingredients and products and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, each restaurant's management team determines the restaurant's
daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies, and accordingly, orders from approved suppliers, and distributors. The restaurant management
team inspects deliveries to ensure that the products received meet our safety and quality specifications. Additionally, we engage an independent auditing company to
perform unannounced comprehensive food safety and sanitation assessments at least three times a year in all Company-owned and franchised restaurants. If an
assessment identifies any gaps, a documented plan is required for any deficiency noted. This same follow-up requirement is in place for government regulatory
inspections.

To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the best possible prices for our high-quality ingredients, products, and supplies, our centralized purchasing
team negotiates supply agreements that may include fixed price contracts that can vary in term or formula-based pricing agreements that can fluctuate on changes in raw
material commodity pricing. Of our total cost of goods in 2022, ground beef represented approximately 15%, poultry represented approximately 12%, and potatoes
represented

approximately 11%. We monitor the market for the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of
fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily cheese, bacon and ground beef, have historically been subject to market price
fluctuations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced distribution disruptions, commodity cost inflation, and certain food and supply shortages. To manage this
risk in part, we enter into fixed-price purchase commitments for certain commodities; however, it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed-price purchase
commitments for certain commodities, or we may choose not to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities. We believe that substantially all of our food and
supplies meeting our specifications are available from alternate sources, which we have identified to diversify our supply chain. As of December 25, 2022,
approximately 49% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times
through the end of 2023.
Restaurant Development, Remodels, and Donatos®
In 2020, Red Robin reestablished a new restaurant development program as part of its long-term growth strategy. With the transition to a new leadership team in
2022, we have deprioritized new restaurant growth as we focus on other business initiatives and uses of capital.
In 2022, we resumed our restaurant refresh and remodel program to keep our restaurants relevant and well-maintained. We continue to believe this type of
investment presents an opportunity to provide compelling investment returns. We are conducting a thorough review and evaluation of all completed refreshes and
remodels to gather learnings and measure consumer response. When complete, we expect this evaluation will inform our go forward design criteria, investment level,
and pace of refreshes and remodels.
In 2020, we announced our partnership with Donatos®, a high-quality pizza brand "nested" inside of Red Robin restaurants. Through this partnership, our
restaurants prepare and serve DonatosⓇ branded pizzas to our dine-in and off-premises Guests. Pursuant to a licensing arrangement, we pay royalties on sales of
DonatosⓇ pizza products to Donatos®. As of December 25, 2022, we have introduced DonatosⓇ pizzas to 245 restaurants. We plan to continue implementation of
DonatosⓇ to additional restaurants in 2023 and anticipate eventually operating DonatosⓇ in substantially all Red Robin restaurants. We invested $6.1 million and
$17.1 million in the Donatos® expansion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Comparable restaurant revenue growth in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 at
restaurants with DonatosⓇ outperformed restaurants without Donatos® by 470 basis points.
Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements
As of December 25, 2022, our franchisees operated 97 restaurants in 16 states and British Columbia, Canada. Our two largest franchisees own 41 restaurants
located in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio.
Franchise Compliance Assurance
We actively work with and monitor our franchisees' performance to help them develop and operate their restaurants in compliance with Red Robin's standards,
systems, and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we review the franchisee's site selection and provide the franchisee with our prototype building
plans. We provide trainers to assist the franchisee in opening the restaurant for business. We advise the franchisee on all menu items, management training, and
equipment and food purchases. We also exchange best operating practices with our franchisees as we strive to improve our operating systems while attaining a high level
of franchisee participation.
Information Systems and Digital Technology
We rely on information systems and digital technology in all aspects of our operations, striving to create seamless Guest experiences and enable Operations to
deliver on our Brand commitments. In our restaurants, these technologies are designed to facilitate operational efficiency and support the Guest experience. These
technologies include (but are not limited to) labor management systems, sales and forecasting tools, inventory management, and operational execution solutions. These
technologies are integrated with our point-of-sale system to provide daily, weekly, and period-to-date reporting that is important for our Operators to run an efficient and
high-performing restaurant. We also use technology to interact with our Guests via our digital platforms, including our website, mobile Apps, loyalty platform, online
ordering site, table top kiosks, Server handhelds, and Guest feedback systems, which provide actionable insights on the overall Guest experience.
We utilize centralized financial, accounting, and human resource management systems to support our Restaurant Support Center and Company-owned restaurants.
In addition, we use an Operations scorecard that integrates data from our centralized systems and distributes information to assist in managing the performance of our
restaurants. We believe these combined tools are important in analyzing and improving our operations, profit margins, and monitoring other key business metrics.
In 2021, we significantly upgraded our digital capabilities implementing the first phase of our digital transformation which included a new and improved ordering
site, custom mobile Apps (iOS and Android), and a new integrated Loyalty

Platform specifically designed to connect with our Guests in a more meaningful and personalized way. Digital enhancements and loyalty improvements continue to be an iterative effort and we expect to continue to implement ongoing enhancements that benefit our Guests and Team Members. In 2023 and 2024, we expect to begin infrastructure modernization efforts to improve performance and stability of current and future technology solutions.

We accept electronic payment cards from our Guests for payment in our restaurants. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our Guests and Team Members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our Guests' credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our Team Members' personal information. We have taken several steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect. Our systems are carefully designed and configured to protect against data loss or compromise. For example, because of the number of credit card transactions processed in our Company-owned restaurants, Red Robin is required to maintain compliance per the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) for our networks and systems both at our Restaurant Support Center and Company-owned restaurants. Red Robin not only meets the requirements but also maintains a higher-level designation as a Merchant and Service Provider. The major credit card companies, require annual assessment to ensure certain levels of system security and procedures are in place to protect our Guests' credit card and other personal information.

We also engage security assessors and consultants to review and advise us on our other data security practices with respect to protection of other sensitive personal information that we obtain from Guests and Team Members.

Marketing and Advertising

We build brand equity and awareness through a marketing mix inclusive of paid, owned and earned media. We leverage social media, SEM, SEO, online reputation and social community management, email, SMS, website and public relations initiatives. These programs are funded primarily through cooperative creative development and national media advertising funds.

Beginning in 2023, we expect to reallocate national paid media marketing activities to emphasize Guest engagement through local restaurant marketing in communities in which we operate and improve the dine-in experience. In recent years, we have undertaken significant market research initiatives to gain a deep understanding of our Guests, our brand promise, and what we must do to deliver that promise. We use a Guest satisfaction tool in all restaurants that provides feedback from Guests on their experiences. Restaurant managers also continually monitor our performance relative to peers and test potential business drivers among both current and potential Guests. We leverage our over eleven million member Red Robin Royalty™ database to gain insights and track the frequency and purchase behavior of our Guests.

Our brand creative and messaging highlights our craveable food, distinctive positioning, dine-in experience and emotional connection with Guests. We will also continue marketing support for our off-premises business which includes carryout, catering, and delivery.

Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and our Guests may choose to purchase food at supermarkets or other food retailers. Although, for some occasions,
we compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including quick-service and fast-casual restaurants, our primary competition is with other sit-down, casual
dining restaurants within the full service dining segment. In addition, we compete to attract Guests for off-premises dining occasions, including online ordering, delivery,
to-go, and catering. The number, size, and strength of competitors vary by region, concept, market, and even restaurant. We compete on the basis of taste, quality, price
of food and related Guest value, Guest service, ambiance, location, and overall dining experience.

We believe our Guest demographics, strong brand recognition, Gourmet Burger concept, family friendly atmosphere, attractive price-value relationship, and the
quality of our food and service enable us to differentiate ourselves from our casual dining competitors. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these
factors. Our competitors include well-established national chains which have more substantial marketing resources. We also compete with many other restaurant and
retail establishments for Team Members.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Sales in most of our restaurants are typically higher during the summer months and winter holiday season due to
factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality.
Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and comparable restaurant
sales for any particular future period may vary.
Trademarks
We have a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including the Red Robin®, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers®, "YUMMM®", Red Robin Gourmet
Burgers + Brews®, and Red Robin Royalty® and logos. We have registered these marks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we
have registered various trademarks in certain other international jurisdictions. Pursuant to our licensing arrangement with Donatos®, we license the right to use the
Donatos
trademark.
In order to better protect our brand, we have also registered the Internet domain namewww.redrobin.com. We believe our trademarks, service marks, and other
intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to our brand building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concept.
Government Regulation
Over the last few years, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments have issued and revised a significant amount of regulations
affecting our business, with requirements often changing without much advance notice. Regulations relating to the vaccination and COVID-19 testing of Guests and
Team Members, Guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices, sanitation practices, isolation and quarantine periods for Team Members, paid
sick leave, and mask mandates for Guests and Team Members materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our Guests.

We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content, and
menu labeling. Our collection or use of personal information about Guests or our Team Members is regulated at the federal and state levels, including the California
Consumer Privacy Act.
Our restaurants are subject to various licensing requirements and other regulations by state, and local health, safety, fire, and other authorities, including licensing
requirements, regulations for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food, and public health related indoor capacity restrictions. To date, we have been able to obtain and
maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals. The development and construction of new restaurants is also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land
use, and environmental regulations. We are also subject to certain guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
7

# Table of Contents

and various state codes and regulations, which require restaurants and our brand to provide full and equal access to persons with physical disabilities.
We are also subject to federal regulation and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee
relationship. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our Team Members and can significantly impact our operating costs. These laws govern
minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, tip credits, paid leave, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, health care and other benefits, workers' compensation
rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations, and discriminatory conduct.

## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider the risks described below before making an investment
decision. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The trading price or
value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. When making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you
should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.

### Risks Related to Our Business
Our business strategy may not be successful or achieve the desired results, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

Our "North Star" business strategy developed under new leadership is designed to drive long-term shareholder value and enhance Red Robin's competitive
positioning. Our strategy focuses on transforming to an operations focused restaurant company, elevating the Guest experience, removing costs and complexity,
optimizing Guest engagement, and driving growth in comparable restaurant revenue and unit level profitability, and delivering financial commitments.

These strategies and related initiatives, including changes to our restaurant management structures, may not result in sustained higher sales. Changes to our
operations structure and compensation, service model, Guest experience and cooking platform, supply chain and vendors, and Guest engagement may not achieve the
business growth and results we expect, which may negatively affect Guest satisfaction, Guest traffic, sales, or profits. Our business and desired results depend upon our
ability to continue to grow and evolve through various important strategic initiatives. There can be no assurance we will be able to develop or implement these or other
important strategic initiatives, or that we have, or will have, sufficient resources to fully and successfully implement, sustain results from, or achieve additional expected
benefits from them, which could in turn adversely affect our business.

The global and domestic economic environment may negatively affect frequency of Guest visits and average ticket spend at our restaurants, which would negatively
affect our revenues and our results of operations.

The global and domestic economic environment affects the restaurant industry and may negatively affect us directly and indirectly through our customers,
distributors, and suppliers. These conditions include unemployment, weakness and lack of consistent improvement in the housing markets, downtrend or delays in
residential or commercial real estate development, volatility in the U.S. stock market and in other financial markets, inflationary pressures, wage rates, tariffs and other
trade barriers, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumer confidence. As a result, our Guests may be apprehensive about the economy
and maintain or further reduce their level of discretionary spending, especially in a potential recessionary environment. This could affect the frequency with which our
Guests choose to dine-out or the amount they spend on meals, thereby decreasing our revenues and potentially negatively affecting our operating results. Also, our
Guests may choose to purchase food at supermarkets or other food retailers. We believe there is a risk that prolonged uncertain economic conditions might cause
consumers to make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently or at lower priced restaurants on a more
permanent basis, which would have a negative effect on our profitability as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of sales.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and may further disrupt our business, which has and could further materially adversely affect our operations, business, and
financial results. Any future epidemic, disease outbreak, or public health emergency may result in similar adverse effects.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to negatively impact our
ability to operate our restaurants, sales and traffic at our restaurants, restaurant staffing, availability of supplies, and commodity costs. The extent to which the COVID-
19 pandemic and other epidemics, disease outbreaks, or public health emergencies will impact our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations
depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency; the
negative impact on the economy; the short and longer-term impacts on the demand for restaurant services and levels of consumer confidence; our ability to successfully
navigate the impacts; government action, including restrictions on restaurant operations; and increased unemployment and reductions in consumer discretionary
spending. Even if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may damage our reputation and adversely affect our
business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

We cannot guarantee that changes to our operational policies and training will be effective to keep our Team Members and Guests safe from COVID-19 or future
public health emergency. Any publicity relating to health concerns or the perceived or specific outbreaks of COVID-19 or other public health emergency attributed to
one or more of our restaurants, or restaurants generally, could result in a significant decrease in Guest traffic in all of our restaurants and could have a material adverse
effect

10

on our results of operations. Changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or future public health emergencies and any additional changes may materially adversely
affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly if these changes are in place for a prolonged amount of time.
If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work or we are unable to properly staff our restaurants in connection with COVID-19, our operations may
be negatively impacted. Work-from-home and other measures have introduced and may continue to introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks,
and have affected the way we conduct our business, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that measures taken will be sufficient to
mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical
functions.
The COVID-19 pandemic as well as other public health emergencies may also materially adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic growth plans,
including delays in the rollout of DonatosⓇ pizza to additional restaurant locations, the implementation of technology platforms and technology solutions, restaurant
remodels, and development of new restaurants in future years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced shortages of food items and other supplies at our restaurants,
and we could face similar supply shortages in a future health emergency. A shortage of supplies could adversely impact our restaurant sales and operations. In addition,
certain of our Company-owned restaurants have remained permanently closed or may ultimately close, directly or indirectly, due to COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic on our business could continue to have adverse effects on our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and financial
condition, some of which may be significant and adversely impact our access to capital or to borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and, as a result, our ability to
operate our business on the same terms as we conducted business prior to the pandemic, complete our planned capital expenditures, and execute our strategic plan.
Our success depends on our ability to effectively compete in the restaurant industry to attract and retain Guests.
Competition in the restaurant industry is intense and barriers to entry are low. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurants in all segments
ranging from quick serve and fast casual to polished casual and those verging on fine dining. These competitors range from independent local operators that have
opened restaurants in various markets, high growth targeted "better" burger concepts in the quick serve and fast casual space, to the well-capitalized national restaurant
companies. Many of these concepts have already captured segments of the market that we are targeting, and are expanding faster than we are, penetrating both desirable
geographic and demographic markets. Many of our competitors are well established in the casual dining market segment and in certain geographic locations and some
of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have available. Accordingly, they may be better equipped than us to
increase marketing or to take other measures to maintain their competitive position, including the use of significant discount offers to attract Guests. We also compete
with other restaurants and retail establishments for prime real estate locations.
We have experienced and continue to experience the impacts of labor shortages and significant labor cost inflation, which have and may continue to negatively
impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to provide the experience our Guests expect and desire depends on our ability to continue attracting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified
management and operating Team Members, especially our restaurant-level leadership in our new Market Partner and Managing Partner system. Labor shortages in our
industry and in the broader economy have disrupted, and may further disrupt, our ability to maintain adequate staffing levels at our restaurants. Increasing competition
in the market for Team Members may increase our labor costs, including by requiring us to take additional measures to ensure that our compensation and benefits for
Team Members remain competitive within the restaurant industry and with other industries that compete with us for workers, which could materially increase our
expenses. During the last couple years, we took, and we may continue to take, certain measures to limit the impact of staffing shortages on the Guest experience. These
measures included limiting operating hours and dine-in services at some of our restaurants. If labor shortages continue or worsen, we may be required to take similar or
additional measures at a larger number of our restaurants. We have also recently announced changes to our restaurant management structures. If we are not successful in
implementing these measures, or if these measures are insufficient to mitigate the impacts of any labor shortages, our Guest experience may be negatively impacted,
leading to a decline in traffic and sales, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, many of our vendor partners continue to experience challenges in hiring and retention, which together with global supply chain disruptions have
contributed to intermittent product and distribution shortages. We may be unable to mitigate the impacts of such disruptions by locating vendors who can provide us
with supplies that meet our timing, quality, and cost requirements and expectations, or at all, particularly in the event of widespread supply chain disruptions. Sustained
supply shortages have and could continue to adversely affect our revenue and our costs.
We believe it is becoming increasing likely that the United States federal government will seek to significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit
wage (or eliminate the tip credit altogether) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. Should this happen,
other state and local jurisdictions that have
11

# Page 14 of 79

Table of Contents
historically mandated higher wages and greater benefits than what is required under federal law may seek to further increase wages and mandated benefits. In addition to
increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other
Team Members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities, and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the
applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wage increase or expansion of benefits mandates will have a
particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for
goods, construction, and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs.
While we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements, greater economies of scale and
by offering a variety of health plans to our Team Members, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to anticipate and offset
increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
Decreased cash flow from operations, or an inability to access credit or successfully execute our potential sale-leaseback transactions could negatively affect our
business initiatives or may result in our inability to execute our revenue, expense, and capital deployment strategies.
Our ability to fund our operating plans and to implement our capital deployment strategies depends on sufficient cash flow from operations or other financing,
including using funding under our revolving Credit Facility and from potential sale-leaseback transactions. Our capital deployment strategies include but are not limited
to paying down debt, maintaining existing restaurants and infrastructure, and executing on our long-term transformation strategy. If we experience decreased cash flow
from operations, our ability to fund our operations and planned initiatives, and to take advantage of growth opportunities, may be delayed or negatively affected. In
addition, these disruptions and any resulting negative effect on our net income, cash flows, or other relevant financial performance metrics under our revolving Credit
Facility could affect our ability to borrow or comply with our covenants under that facility. While our share repurchase program is currently suspended, when resumed,
any repurchase by us of our shares of common stock will further reduce cash available for operations and future growth, as well as debt repayment.
A privacy or security breach involving our information technology systems, or the failure of our data security measures could interrupt our business, damage our
reputation, and negatively affect our operations and profits.
The protection of Guest, Team Member, and Company data is critical to us. We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments,
consumer credit, and fraud. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal
and health information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and
constantly changing requirements including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other similar legislative initiatives. Compliance with these requirements
may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and the development of new administrative processes, and if we fail to comply with the laws and
regulations regarding privacy and security, we could be exposed to risks of fines, investigations, litigation and disruption of our operations.
Moreover, we accept electronic payment cards from our Guests for payment in our restaurants. In the ordinary course of our business, we receive and maintain
certain personal information from our Guests, Team Members, and vendors, and we process Guest payments using payment information. Customers and employees
have a high expectation we will adequately protect their personal information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this
customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this
information. A number of restaurant operators and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen.
Although we employ security technologies and practices and have taken other steps to try to prevent a breach, we may nevertheless not have the resources or technical
sophistication to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. If we have experienced, or in the future experience, a security breach, we could become subject to
claims, lawsuits, or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft of credit or debit card information, compromised security and
information systems, failure of our employees to comply with applicable laws, the unauthorized acquisition or use of such information by third parties, or other similar
claims. Any such incidents or proceedings could disrupt the operation of our restaurants, adversely affect our reputation, Guest confidence, and our results of operations,
or result in the imposition of penalties or cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenditures, including those necessary to remediate any damage to persons
whose personal information may have been compromised. Although we have established a number of procedures designed to increase transparency and address our
Guests' concerns regarding data breaches (whether actual or perceived), this policy may not be effective in addressing those concerns, which may in turn adversely
affect our reputation and Guest confidence. We maintain a separate insurance policy covering cyber security risks and such insurance coverage may, subject to policy
terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, but is subject to a retention amount and may not be applicable to a particular incident or otherwise may be
insufficient to cover all our losses beyond any retention.

Further, in light of recent court rulings and amendments to policy forms, there is uncertainty as to whether traditional commercial general liability policies will be
construed to cover the expenses related to a cyber-attack and breaches if credit and debit card information is stolen.

Because of the number of credit card transactions we process, we are required to maintain the highest level of PCI Data Security Standard compliance at our
Restaurant Support Center and Company-owned restaurants. As part of an overall security program and to meet PCI standards, we undergo regular external vulnerability
scans and we are reviewed by a third party assessor. As PCI standards change, we may be required to implement additional security measures. If we do not maintain the
required level of PCI compliance, we could be subject to costly fines or additional fees from the card brands that we accept or lose our ability to accept those payment
cards. Our franchisees are separate businesses that have different levels of compliance required depending on the number of credit card transactions processed. If our
franchisees fail to maintain the appropriate level of PCI compliance or they experience a security breach, it could negatively impact their business operations, and we
could face a loss of or reduction in royalties or other payments they are required to remit to us and it could adversely affect our reputation and Guest confidence.

**If there is a material failure in our information technology systems, our business operations and profits could be negatively affected, and our systems may be
inadequate to support our future growth strategies.**

We rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial systems, marketing
programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions. This reliance has grown since the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic as we have had to rely to a greater extent on systems such as online ordering, contactless payments, online reservations, systems supporting a
remote workforce. Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, including
technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to effectively manage and run our business.
These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments
of resources and capital.

We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology
systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity and online and offline fraud are prevalent
and continue to increase. In addition to traditional computer "hackers," threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states and nation-
state supported actors now engage in attacks. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social engineering, such as phishing,
malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential
stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection
for long periods of time. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states and nation-state supported actors, are
becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm and diversion of funds.
Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example,
applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.

Any breach of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation
of our consumers', users' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our
business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation, resulting in lost sales and consumers,
fines, lawsuits, government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections) or significant legal and remediation expenses. We
also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. Additionally, if third parties on which we rely
experience cybersecurity incidents, we may not become aware of such incidents in a timely manner, which may impact our ability to mitigate their impacts, which may
exacerbate the risks described above.

In addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those initially implemented in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our information technology systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-
attacks. Our software or information technology systems, or that of third parties upon who we rely to operate our business, may have material vulnerabilities and, despite
our efforts to identify and remediate these vulnerabilities, our efforts may not be successful or we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial
measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. It may be expensive and time-consuming to remediate material vulnerabilities, and our operations,
reputation, sales and financial performance may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully and promptly remediate such vulnerabilities. Further, like other
companies in the restaurant industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing attacks, and other
attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. For

example, in 2021, a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache log4j was identified as affecting large amounts of systems worldwide, and one of our third party
software service providers was impacted and suffered a ransomware attack as a result. We completed investigation of this incident and concluded that they resulted in no
material adverse impact to us. However, despite the precautions we take to mitigate the risks of such events, an attack on our enterprise information technology system,
or those of third parties with which we do business, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information or a breach of
confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Such events could impair our ability to conduct our operations or cause disruptions to our supply chain, which
could have an adverse impact on revenue and harm our reputation. Additionally, such an event could expose us to regulatory sanctions or penalties, lawsuits or other
legal action or cause us to incur legal liabilities and costs, which could be significant, in order to address and remediate the effects of an attack and related security
concerns. The insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.
We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with
regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If these systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of
our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues
and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal information collection for digital marketing, digital
commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications
throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers. Any interruption
in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in digital commerce and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.
Moreover, these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption from
earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches, or other attempts to harm our systems.
A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and
secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could result in interruption and delays in Guest services, adversely affect our reputation, and
negatively impact our results of operations.
Our marketing and branding strategies to attract, engage, and retain our Guests may not be successful, which could negatively affect our business.
We continue to evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to customers and compete effectively to attract, engage, and retain customers. Our
unique loyalty program, Red Robin Royalty™, has experienced some success in enrollment and driving sales and Guest counts by providing loyal Guests with various
incentives and rewards. We intend to continue to provide a family friendly atmosphere and shifted our marketing focus to reinforce moments of connection and brand
equities instead of price to drive Guest engagement, traffic, and sales. Going forward, we plan to focus more on engaging with and supporting the local communities in
which we operate. We do not have any assurance our marketing strategies will be successful. If our advertising, branding, and other marketing programs and methods
are not successful, we may not generate the level of restaurant sales or Guest traffic we expect, and the expense associated with these programs may negatively affect our
financial results. Moreover, many of our competitors have larger marketing resources and more extensive national marketing strategies and media usage and we may not
be able to successfully compete against those established programs.
If we are unable to effectively use and monitor social media, our marketing efforts as well as our reputation could be harmed, which could negatively impact our
restaurant sales and financial performance.
As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on an omni-channel creative strategy including increased social and digital engagement platforms, including Facebook®,
Instagram®, and Twitter® to attract and retain Guests. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad
appeal. Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more
traditional social media platforms obsolete and making it challenging for us to differentiate our social media messaging. As a result, we need to continuously innovate
and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal.
Social media can be challenging because it provides consumers, employees, and others with the ability to communicate approval or displeasure with a business, in
near real time, and provides any individual with the ability to reach a broad audience and with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. If we are
unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could "go viral" causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation,
whether or not factually accurate. In addition, social media can facilitate the improper disclosure of proprietary information, exposure of personally identifiable
information, fraud, or out-of-date information.
As a result, if we do not appropriately manage our social media strategies, our marketing efforts in this area may not be successful and any failure (or perceived
failure) to effectively respond to negative or potentially damaging social media chatter,
14

whether accurate or not, could damage our reputation, negatively impacting our restaurant sales and financial performance. The inappropriate use of social media
vehicles by our Guests or Team Members could increase our costs, lead to litigation, or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.
Changes in consumer preferences could negatively affect our results of operations.
The restaurant industry is characterized by the continual introduction of new concepts and is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences, tastes, and eating
and purchasing habits. Our restaurants compete on the basis of a varied menu and feature burgers, salads, soups, appetizers, other entrees, desserts, and our signature
alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and we are in the process of rolling out DonatosⓇ pizza to our restaurants. Our continued success depends, in part, upon the
continued popularity of these foods and this style of dining. Shifts in consumer preferences away from this cuisine or dining style could have a material adverse effect
on our future profitability. In addition, competitors' use of significant advertising and food discounting could influence our Guests' dining choices. There is no assurance
that the addition of DonatosⓇ pizza to our menu will not negatively impact our brand or cannibalize sales of core menu items.
Further, changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole rests
on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, and national levels, and the effect on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet,
nutrition, and health. New laws requiring additional nutritional information to be disclosed on our menus, changes in nutritional guidelines issued by the federal
government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, or academic studies, among other things,
may affect consumer choice and cause consumers to significantly alter their dining choices in ways that adversely affect our sales and profitability.
We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases, and risks related to renewal.
As of December 25, 2022, 378 of our 414 Company-owned restaurants are located on leased premises. We have in the past and may in the future engage in sale-
lease back transactions, which have and may in the future increase the number of our leased properties. Payments under our operating leases account for a significant
portion of our operating expenses. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. In connection with closing
restaurants, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance
of the lease term.
In addition, as each of our leases expires, there can be no assurance we will be able to renew our expiring leases after the expiration of all remaining renewal
options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we may incur additional costs to operate our restaurants, including increased rent and other costs
related to the negotiation of terms of occupancy of an existing leased premise. If we are unable to renew a lease or determine not to renew a lease, there may be costs
related to the relocation and development of a replacement restaurant or, if we are unable to relocate, reduced revenue.
Changes in consumer buying patterns, particularly due to declines in traffic near our leased locations, and increases in online sales, may affect our revenues,
operating results, and liquidity.
The success of our restaurants depends in large part on leased locations. Our restaurants are primarily located near high density retail areas such as regional malls,
lifestyle centers, big box shopping centers, and entertainment centers. We depend on a high volume of visitors at these centers to attract Guests to our restaurants. As
demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may or may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Online sales continue to increase and negatively
impact consumer traffic at traditional "brick and mortar" retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, big box shopping centers and entertainment centers. A
decline in development or closures of businesses in these settings or a decline in visitors to retail areas near our restaurants could negatively affect our restaurant sales.
In addition, desirable locations for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost, due in part to the inability to easily terminate a long-
term lease.
In the last several years, off-premises sales, specifically delivery, have increased due to consumer demand for convenience. While we plan to continue to invest in
the growth of our online, to-go, catering, and delivery services to drive off-premises sales, there can be no guarantee we will be able to continue to increase our off-
premises sales. Off-premises sales could also cannibalize dine-in sales, or our systems and procedures may not be sufficient to handle off-premises sales, which may
require additional investments in technology or people. Additionally, a large percentage of delivery from our restaurants is through third party delivery companies.
These third party delivery companies require us to pay them a commission, which lowers our profit margin on those sales. Any bad press, whether true or not, regarding
third party delivery companies or their business model may negatively impact our sales. While we have introduced an alternative to third party delivery by offering an
online Company platform to collect orders and outsource the "last mile" of delivery, we may not be able to convert Guests to our platform and that model remains
subject to some of the same risks.

**Our operations are susceptible to the changes in cost and availability of commodities which could negatively affect our operating results.**

Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation and monetary policy, potential imposition of tariffs on imports from other countries, product availability, recalls of food products, and seasonality, as well as the effects of the current macroeconomic environment on our suppliers, may affect our commodity costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain. In an effort to mitigate some of this risk, we enter into fixed price agreements on some of our food and beverage products, including certain proteins, produce and cooking oil. As of the end of 2022, approximately 49% of our estimated 2023 annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times through 2023. Changes in the price or availability of commodities for which we do not have fixed price contracts could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Expiring contracts with our food suppliers could also result in unfavorable renewal terms and therefore increase costs associated with these suppliers or may necessitate negotiations with alternate suppliers. Although the majority of our commodities are sourced domestically, changes in trade policy and tariffs could negatively impact our commodity costs. We may be unable to obtain favorable contract terms with suppliers or adjust our purchasing practices and menu prices to respond to changing food costs, and a failure to do so could negatively affect our operating results.

**We may experience interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from third parties.**

Our restaurants depend on frequent deliveries of fresh produce, food, beverage, and other products. This subjects us to the risk of interruptions in food and beverage supplies that may result from a variety of causes including, but not limited to, outbreaks of food-borne illness, disruption of operation of production facilities, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy of our suppliers or other unforeseen circumstances, especially where a product comes from a single or small number of suppliers. Such shortages could adversely affect our revenue and profits. Our restaurants bear risks associated with the timeliness of deliveries by suppliers and distributors as well as the solvency, reputation, labor relationships, freight rates, and health and safety standards of each supplier and distributor. We strive to have multiple approved suppliers on key items; however, the Company is undertaking initiatives to consolidate suppliers and there are situations where we only have one approved supplier, which increases the risk to our supply chain if something were to happen to interrupt the supplier's ability to continue supplying the Company. Other significant risks associated with our suppliers and distributors include improper handling of food and beverage products, and/or the adulteration or contamination of such food and beverage products.

**Price increases may negatively affect Guest visits.**

From time to time, we increase prices, primarily to offset increased costs and operating expenses. We cannot provide assurance that any future price increases will not deter Guests from visiting our restaurants, reduce the frequency of their visits, or affect their purchasing decisions.

**New or improved technologies or changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies could negatively affect our business.**

Advances in technologies or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by such technologies could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable Guest proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than us, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position. There can be no assurance we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology, and market trends. Additionally, from time to time, we implement new or different technologies in our restaurants, including our recent decision to introduce flat top cooking methods into our restaurants. These initiatives have involved and may in the future involve significant capital expenditures, and may involve unexpected expenditures for training, maintenance or otherwise, and may ultimately not produce the results we anticipate. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.

**Expanding our restaurant base is a component of our long-term growth and our ability to open and profitably operate new restaurants is subject to factors beyond our control.**

The expansion of our restaurant base depends in large part on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to timely and efficiently open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants on a profitable basis. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants, or the inability to profitably operate them once opened, could materially and adversely affect our planned growth.

Table of Contents

The success of our expansion strategy and the success of new restaurants depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:

*   changes to or volatility in the macroeconomic environment nationally and regionally, which could affect restaurant-level performance and influence our decisions on the rate of expansion, timing, and the number of restaurants to be opened;
*   competition in our markets and general economic conditions that may affect consumer spending or choice;
*   our ability to locate, hire, train, and retain qualified operating Team Members to staff our new restaurants, especially our Managing Partners and Market Partners;
*   identification of and ability to secure an adequate supply of available and suitable restaurant sites;
*   timely adherence to development schedules;
*   cost and availability of capital to fund restaurant expansion and operation;
*   negotiation of favorable lease and construction terms;
*   the availability and cost of construction materials and labor;
*   our ability to manage construction and development costs of new restaurants;
*   unforeseen environmental problems with new locations;
*   securing required governmental approvals and permits, including liquor licenses, in a timely manner or at all;
*   our ability to attract and retain Guests;
*   weather, natural disasters, and other calamities; and
*   our ability to operate at acceptable profit margins.

We are subject to the risks presented by acquisitions or refranchising.

As part of our expansion efforts, we have acquired some of our franchised restaurants in the past. In the future, we may, from time to time, consider opportunistic acquisitions or dispositions of restaurants. We may also in the future pursue refranchising with quality operators in certain identified markets. Any future acquisitions or dispositions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include among other things:

*   the difficulty of integrating operations and Team Members;
*   the potential disruption to our ongoing business;
*   the potential distraction of management;
*   the effect on selling, general, and administrative expenses and earnings;
*   the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies; and
*   the impairment of relationships with Team Members and Guests as a result of changes in ownership and management.

New or less mature restaurants, once opened, may vary in profitability and levels of operating revenue for six months or more.

New and less mature restaurants typically experience higher operating costs in both dollars and percentage of revenue initially when compared to restaurants in the comparable restaurant base. It takes approximately six months or more for new restaurants to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies and other factors typically associated with new restaurants. These factors include operating costs, which are often significantly greater during the first several months of operation, and fluctuating Guest counts at new locations, as well as competition from competitors or our own restaurants, consumer acceptance of our restaurants in new markets and lack of market awareness of our brand in a new market. Further, there is no assurance our less mature restaurants will attain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants.

The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in the Western United States makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in that region.

As of December 25, 2022, a total of 166 or 40% of our 414 Company-owned restaurants, representing 49% of restaurant revenues, were located in the Western United States (i.e., Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington state). As a result of our geographic concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in the Western United States, as well as regional differences in the legal, regulatory, and litigation environment, could have a

material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other regional occurrences such as local strikes, energy shortages, or increases in energy prices,
droughts, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters.
We rely on our senior executive team for the development and execution of our business strategy and the loss of any member of our senior executive team could
negatively affect our operating results.
We recently implemented significant changes in our senior executive management team to support the Company's new "North Star" five-point plan. Key members
of our senior executive management team are central to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or attract other highly qualified senior
executives, particularly if we do not offer competitive employment terms. The loss of the services of any of our key senior executives or the failure to implement an
appropriate succession plan could prevent us from achieving our business strategy and initiatives, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our
results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.
If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified restaurant management and operations Team Members in an increasingly competitive market, we may
be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified management and operating Team Members is central to providing the desired Guest and Team Member
experience in our restaurants and delivering on our business strategy. Qualified management and operations Team Members are currently in high demand. From time to
time, we make capital expenditures for, and commit management resources towards, efforts aimed at improving our competitiveness and our ability to attract and retain
qualified management and operating Team Members, such as our recently announced restaurant management transition program. We may not be successful in
implementing these initiatives, and they may not lead to the benefits or results that we anticipate. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people, especially in our
restaurants at the Managing Partner level and regionally at the Market Partner level, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses,
hourly Team Member turnover could increase, and our ability to operate our restaurants and roll out new service model and technology solutions effectively could be
limited, and the Guest experience could be negatively affected, leading to a decline in traffic and sales.
Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due to various risks and unexpected circumstances, including increases in costs, seasonality,
weather, and other factors outside our control.
We are subject to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual quarterly and annual results to fluctuate significantly or be negatively affected. These
risks include but are not limited to: extended periods of inclement weather which may affect Guest visits as well as limit the availability and cost of key commodities
such as beef, poultry, potatoes, and other items that are important ingredients in our products; material disruptions in our supply chain; changes in borrowings and
interest rates; changes to accounting methods or principles; impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and losses on restaurant closures; and costs from natural
disasters and repairs to damaged or lost property.
Moreover, our business fluctuates seasonally. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer
months and winter holiday season. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of
seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter
or for any year, and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease.
Our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business, expose us to liability or damage our reputation.
Franchisees are independent entities and are not our employees, partners, or affiliates. We share with our franchisees what we believe to be best practices in the
restaurant industry; however, franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses. Consequently, the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be
diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and
requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant Team Members. In addition, as independent businesses, franchisees may not be required
to comply with the same levels of business or regulatory compliance we are. While we try to ensure the quality of our brand and compliance with our operating
standards, and the confidentiality thereof, are maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot provide assurance our franchisees will avoid actions that negatively affect
the reputation of Red Robin or the value of our proprietary information. Our image and reputation and the image and reputation of other franchisees may suffer
materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline if our franchisees do not operate restaurants according to our standards.

We are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor-licensee relationship. Further, there have been
historical actions before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) where it was alleged that a parent company could be held liable for the actions of its franchisees,
including potentially jointly liable for labor and wage violations by its franchisees. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing our franchisee
relationships or adverse decisions similar to the above-described NLRB actions could subject us to liability for actions of the franchisees, or expose us to liability to
franchisees, or fines and penalties for non-compliance.
Food safety and food-borne illness concerns, and any related unfavorable publicity could have an adverse effect on our business.
We dedicate substantial resources to ensuring our Guests enjoy safe, quality food products. Nonetheless, restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely
affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation regarding poor food quality, food-borne illness, personal injury, food tampering, communicable disease,
adverse health effects of consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods, or other concerns. Food safety issues also could be caused by food suppliers or
distributors and, as a result, could be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, norovirus, listeria, hepatitis
A, salmonella, or trichinosis, as well as other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our or a franchisee's restaurants, could adversely
affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales. The occurrence of food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected
ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.
Health concerns relating to the consumption of beef, chicken, or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively affect our results of
operations.
Consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about food-related illness, the consumption of beef (which is the key ingredient in many of our menu
items), or negative publicity or publication of government or industry findings concerning food quality, illness, and injury. Further, consumers may react negatively to
reports concerning our food products or health or other concerns or operating issues stemming from one or more of our restaurants. Such negative publicity, whether or
not valid, may negatively affect demand for our food and could result in decreased Guest traffic to our restaurants. A decrease in Guest traffic to our restaurants as a
result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business and negatively affect our
profitability.
Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs, including costs related to the increase in minimum wage and new health care laws.
Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. Increased labor costs, whether due to competition, unionization, increased minimum and tip
wage, state unemployment rates, employee benefits costs, or otherwise, may adversely impact our operating expenses. A considerable amount of our restaurant Team
Members are paid at rates related to the federal, state, or local minimum wage. Further, we have a substantial number of restaurants located in states or municipalities
where the minimum wage is greater than the current federal minimum wage, including California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and New York. For example,
California enacted legislation that increased its minimum wage through a series of annual rate increases, from $10.50 an hour in January 2017 to $15 an hour in January
2022, and some California localities currently mandate wages higher than $15 an hour. In addition, the Biden administration and members of Congress have called for
an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour. We anticipate additional legislation increasing minimum wage standards will be enacted in
future periods and in other jurisdictions, including a potential increase or elimination of the tip credit wage. In addition to increasing the overall wages paid to our
minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other team members who, in recognition of their
tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip
credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor
costs. Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for goods,
construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs.
In the past, many of our eligible Team Members chose not to participate in our Company-sponsored health care plans for various reasons, but we expect to
continue to see increased costs due to the impact of changes in the health care laws, including as a result of any repeal, replacement or other significant modifications of
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act"). Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage or
health care costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. A shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes
could also increase our labor costs. In the past, we have been able to offset increases in labor costs by improving our productivity or changing staffing models in our
restaurants or by taking gradual increases in pricing, but there is no guarantee we can continue to do so in the future. In addition, we rely on our Team Members to
accurately disclose the full amount of tips received, and we based our FICA tax reporting on the amounts provided to us by such tipped Team Members. Inaccurate
Team Member FICA tax reporting could subject us to monetary liabilities. If our labor costs increase and

we are not able to offset costs through productivity or efficiency gains from changing staffing models, profitable sales drivers or costs reduction efforts, or to pass along
the costs in the form of increased prices to our Guests, then it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, changes to our staffing models in
our restaurants due to labor costs or any labor shortages, could negatively impact our ability to provide adequate service levels to our Guests, which could result in
adverse Guest reactions and a possible reduction in Guest traffic at our restaurants.
Our failure to remain in compliance with governmental laws and regulations as they continually evolve, and the associated costs of compliance, could cause our
business results to suffer.
Our business is subject to various federal, state, and local government laws and regulations, including, among others, those relating to our employees, public health
and safety, food safety, alcoholic beverage control, public accommodations, financial and disclosure reporting and controls, and consumer health regulations, including
those pertaining to nutritional content and menu labeling such as the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie
information on their menus. These laws and regulations continually evolve and change, and compliance may be costly and time-consuming. Moreover, we may fail to
maintain compliance with all laws and regulations despite our best efforts. Changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, or failure to comply with them could
result in, among other things, increased exposure to litigation, administrative enforcement actions or governmental investigations or proceedings; revocation of required
licenses or approvals; fines; and civil and criminal liability. These negative consequences could increase the cost of or interfere with our ability to operate our business
and execute our strategies.
Various federal, state, and local employment laws govern our relationship with our Team Members and affect operating costs. These laws govern employee
classification, wage rates, fair scheduling and payment requirements including tip credit laws and overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment and other taxes,
health care and benefits, workers' compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, labor relations, child labor regulations, and discriminatory conduct.
Changes in these laws or our failure to comply with enforcement requirements could require changes to our operations that could harm our operating results. For
example, although we require all of our Team Members to provide us with the government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of
our Team Members, without our knowledge, may not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. A number
of other factors could adversely affect our operating results, including:

*   additional government-imposed increases in minimum and/or tipped wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence, sick leave, and mandated health benefits;
*   increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities;
*   a reduction in the number of states that allow gratuities to be credited toward minimum wage requirements; and
*   increased employee litigation including claims under federal and/or state wage and hour laws, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
    (WARN) Act of 1988.

There has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and
environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and
water use. As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and make commitments, establish goals or set targets
with respect to various environmental and social issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets. If we are not effective in
addressing social and environmental sustainability matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In addition, the actions needed to achieve our commitments, goals
and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us and our supply chain
associated with social and environmental sustainability matters.
We are subject to "dram shop" statutes in some states. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an
establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such intoxicated person. Failure to comply with alcoholic beverage control or dram shop regulations could
subject us to liability and could negatively affect our business.
Our future success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.
Our business prospects will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property, including the Red Robin, Red Robin
Gourmet Burgers®, Red Robin America's Gourmet Burgers & Spirits®, "YUMMM®", Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and BrewsTM, and Red Robin RoyaltyTM names and
logos. We have registered or filed applications for trademarks for these names and logos, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in
Canada and we have applied to register various trademarks in certain other international jurisdictions. Our trademarks could be infringed in ways that leave us without
redress, such as by imitation or by filings by others in jurisdictions where we are not currently

registered. In addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how in operating our restaurants, and we employ various methods to protect these trade secrets and
proprietary know-how. However, such methods may not afford adequate protection and others could independently develop similar know-how or obtain access to our
know-how, concepts, and recipes. Consequently, our business could be negatively affected and less profitable if we are unable to successfully defend and protect our
intellectual property.
The Company's effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws.
Prior to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, then presidential candidate Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, the
creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports, and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. Additionally, a repeal of NOL carrybacks has also been discussed.
During 2022, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, tax legislation that includes the 15% corporate minimum income tax for certain large corporate
taxpayers. At this time, the Company is not subject to the corporate minimum tax and does not project that it will be subject to the tax in the near future. If any or all of
President Biden's other proposed legislation (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to the
Company's effective tax rate and cash tax refunds. Additionally, while we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be
materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash
flows in the period which the final determination is made.
A significant increase in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and business prospects.
As a member of the restaurant industry, we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation, including class action lawsuits, or from Guests alleging illness,
injury, or other food quality, health, or operational concerns. Negative publicity resulting from these allegations could harm our restaurants, regardless of whether the
allegations are valid or whether we are liable. In addition, we are subject to the same risks of negative publicity resulting from these sorts of allegations even if the claim
actually involves one of our franchisees.
Any failure by us to comply with the various federal and state labor laws governing our relationship with our Team Members including requirements pertaining to
minimum wage, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations,
and discriminatory conduct, may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. We have been subject to such claims from time to time. The possibility of
a material adverse effect on our business relating to employment litigation is even more pronounced given the high concentration of Team Members employed in the
Western United States, as this region, and California in particular, has a substantial amount of legislative and judicial activity pertaining to employment-related issues.
Further, employee claims against us based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, or wrongful termination may divert our financial and management
resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations.
Labor organizing could adversely affect our operations and harm our competitive position in the restaurant industry, which could harm our financial performance.
Our employees or others may attempt to unionize our workforce, establish boycotts or picket lines or interrupt our supply chains which could increase our labor
costs, limit our ability to manage our workforce effectively, and cause disruptions to our operations. A loss of our ability to effectively manage our workforce and the
compensation and benefits we offer to our staff members could harm our financial performance.
Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.
There are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure against. Such losses could have
a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our employee health,
workers' compensation, general liability, property, and cyber insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates
underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Failure to obtain and maintain adequate directors' and officers' insurance could materially adversely affect our
ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.

Risks Related to Owning Our Stock
The market price of our common stock is subject to volatility, which has and may continue to attract the interest of activist stockholders.
During fiscal 2022, the price of our common stock fluctuated between $5.70 and $18.42 per share. The market price of our common stock may be significantly
affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst
expectations, changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant industry, announcements of significant transactions
(including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant industry, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In
addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual
company's operating performance. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our Company and industry, as well as factors
related to the equity markets overall. Moreover, such volatility has in the past and may in the future attract the interest of activist stockholders. Responding to activist
stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and the perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from responding to activist strategies could itself then
further affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.
Any failure to repurchase the Company's stock up to the maximum amounts permitted under our repurchase program may negatively impact investor perception of
us and may affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
Our stock repurchase program is temporarily suspended. If and when we reinstate our stock repurchase program, or put a new repurchase program in place, it may
require us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and/or may require us to incur indebtedness utilizing our existing Credit Facility or some other
form of debt financing. Our ability to repurchase stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, as supplemented by proceeds from
the exercise of employee stock options and our capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond
our control. The inability to complete stock repurchases under a repurchase program may negatively impact investor perception of us and may therefore affect the
market price and volatility of our stock.
ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
ITEM 2. Properties
We currently lease the real estate for most of our Company-owned restaurant facilities under operating leases with remaining terms ranging from less than one
year to over 15 years excluding options to extend. These leases generally contain options which permit us to extend the lease term at an agreed rent or at prevailing
market rates. Certain leases provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of adjusted gross restaurant sales in excess of specified levels. Contingent
rental payments are recognized as a variable lease expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines achieving the specified levels
during the year is probable. Certain lease agreements also require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance, and property tax costs.
We own real estate for 36 Company-owned restaurants located in Arizona (4); Arkansas (1); California (1); Colorado (4); Florida (1); Georgia (1); Illinois (1);
Indiana (1); Maryland (1); Missouri (1); North Carolina (3); Ohio (4); Pennsylvania (3); Texas (5); Virginia (4); and Washington (1).
Our Restaurant Support Center and test kitchen is located in Englewood, Colorado. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a dispersed
workforce policy that permits many of our Restaurant Support Center Team Members to continue working remotely and we expect that to continue on a go-forward
basis. For on-site critical, Company leadership, and those who desire to work in a shared location, we have optimized our office footprint at this location to meet the
needs of that population. We occupy this facility under a lease that expires May 31, 2025. In addition, we occupy the first floor and sublease to a third party the second
and third floors of a facility in Greenwood Village, Colorado under a lease that expires on May 31, 2025.
Our existing prototype for new Red Robin restaurants is approximately 5,100 square feet with a capacity of approximately 200 seats. We develop restaurants under
ground leases on which we build our own restaurants in addition to converting existing buildings on standalone, in-line, end cap, and mall locations. As of December 25,
2022, our restaurant locations comprised approximately 2.7 million square feet.

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol RRGB. As of February 24, 2023, there were 89 registered owners of our common stock.

Dividends

We did not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock during 2022, 2021 or 2020. We currently anticipate we will retain any future cash flow to service debt, maintain existing restaurants and infrastructure, and execute on our long-term business strategy. Our Credit Facility has certain limitations on paying dividends or making repurchases of our shares, and we are subject to certain covenant ratios, including a leverage ratio under our Credit Agreement.

Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

During the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022, the Company did not have any sales of securities in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act that have not been reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K. No share repurchases were made by the Company during 2022. Our ability to repurchase shares is limited to certain conditions set forth by our lenders in the Credit Facility.

Performance Graph

The following graph compares the yearly percentage in cumulative total stockholders' return on Common Stock of the Company since the end of its fiscal year 2017, with the cumulative total return over the same period for (i) The Russell 3000 Index, and (ii) the S&P 600 Restaurants.

Pursuant to rules of the SEC, the comparison assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2017, the last trading day in the Company's 2017 fiscal year, in the Company's Common Stock and in each of the indices.

This performance graph shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" under either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides a narrative of our financial performance and condition that
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All comparisons under this heading between 2022 and 2021 refer to the fifty-
two weeks ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, unless otherwise indicated.
Overview
Description of Business
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries ("Red Robin," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company"), primarily operates,
franchises, and develops casual dining restaurants with 511 locations in North America. As of December 25, 2022, the Company operated 414 Company-owned
restaurants located in 38 states. The Company also had 97 franchised restaurants in 16 states and one Canadian province as of December 25, 2022. The Company
operates its business as one operating and one reportable segment.
Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at Company-owned restaurants. We also earn revenue from royalties and fees from
franchised restaurants.
The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of each calendar year. Most of our fiscal years have 52 weeks; however, we experience a 53rd week once every
five to six years. Both 2022 and 2021 refer to 52 week fiscal years.
Fiscal Year 2022 Accomplishments
Fiscal 2022 was a year of progress and transition for our business. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact us particularly in the first half of fiscal 2022
directly through government mandated restrictions, and indirectly through supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. We and the broader United States economy
experienced inflation levels not seen in decades. Despite these headwinds, our accomplishments in 2022 include the following:
• Revenue increased by approximately $104.5 million, from approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021, to approximately $1.3 billion in fiscal 2022.
• Achieved a comparable restaurant revenue increase of 9.2%. Comparable restaurant revenue has increased for eight (8) consecutive quarters.
• Comparable restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant traffic exceeded the industry average as measured by the Black Box Casual Dining index.
• Continued investments in sales building and infrastructure initiatives:
Ο Installed Donatos® in 52 Company-owned restaurants, bringing the total number of restaurants with Donatos® to 245 as of December 25, 2022.
Ο Comparable restaurant revenue growth in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 at restaurants with DonatosⓇ outperformed restaurants without Donatos
by 470 basis points.
Ο Invested in Guest facing facility upgrades and renovations in more than 200 restaurants.
Ο Upgraded infrastructure technology in restaurant and support center locations.
• Facilitated a successful transition to a new Chief Executive Officer and other executive leadership positions.
Inflationary Cost and COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic and the related aftermath continues to create unprecedented challenges for our industry including changing consumer behavior, labor
and supply chain challenges, and wide spread inflationary costs. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased 200 basis points in 2022 compared to 2021, driven
primarily by commodity cost inflation.
Our ability to attract and retain Team
Members became more challenging in the competitive job market in 2022. At the start of fiscal 2022, staffing was our number one priority. We made significant
progress in improving the staffing levels in our restaurants throughout the year. The challenges in hiring and retention and global supply chain disruptions also affected
many of our vendor partners, resulting in intermittent product and distribution shortages.
We remain focused on proactively addressing these industry challenges, while delivering a great Guest experience and continuing to prioritize the satisfaction and
retention of our Team Members.

We believe the non-GAAP measure of adjusted loss per diluted share gives the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and it
is intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted loss per diluted share excludes the effects of asset
impairment; gain on sale of restaurant property; severance and executive transition costs; other financing costs; restaurant closure costs; closed corporate office costs, net
of sublease income; COVID-19 related costs; litigation contingencies; board and stockholder matters costs; goodwill impairment; change in estimate gift card
breakage; write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, and related income tax effects. We have revised our definition of adjusted loss per diluted share to exclude other
financing costs, closed corporate office, net of sublease income, change in estimate - gift card breakage, and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. We did not
revise prior years' adjusted loss per diluted share amounts because there were no other charges similar in nature to these costs. Other companies may define adjusted net
loss per share differently, and as a result our measure of adjusted loss per share may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Adjusted loss per share
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net loss as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance.

The following table summarizes Net Loss (a GAAP measure), and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP measures) for the fifty-two weeks ended
December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021:

Restaurant revenue, which comprises primarily food and beverage sales, increased $92.6 million in 2022, or 8.1%, as compared to 2021. The increase was due to a
$100.6 million, or 9.2%, increase in comparable restaurant revenue, partially offset by a $8.0 million decrease at non-comparable restaurants, including the impact of
restaurant closures. The comparable restaurant revenue increase was driven by a 10.1% increase in average Guest check with a 0.9% decrease in Guest count. The
increase in average Guest check resulted from a 6.4% increase in pricing and a 3.8% increase in menu mix, and was partially offset by a 0.1% decrease from higher
discounts. The increase in menu mix was primarily driven by our limited time menu offerings and higher dine-in sales volumes. Dine-in sales comprised 71.3% of total
food and beverage sales in 2022, as compared to 65.5% in 2021.

Average weekly net sales volumes represent the total restaurant revenue for all Company-owned Red Robin restaurants for each time period presented, divided by
the number of operating weeks in the period. Comparable restaurant revenues include those restaurants that are in the comparable base based on operating five full fiscal
quarters as of the end of each period presented. Temporarily closed Company-owned restaurants due to the COVID-19 pandemic were not included in the comparable
base for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. Fluctuations in average weekly net sales volumes for Company-owned restaurants reflect the
effect of comparable restaurant revenue changes as well as the performance of new and acquired restaurants during the period, the average square footage of our
restaurants, as well as the impact of changing capacity limitations in response to COVID-19 levels in a given locality. Net sales per square foot represents the total of
restaurant revenue for Company-owned restaurants included in the comparable base divided by the total adjusted square feet of Company-owned restaurants included in
the comparable base.

Franchise revenue primarily includes royalty income and advertising fund contributions. Franchise revenue increased $2.1 million, or 12.0%, in 2022 compared to
2021 primarily due to increased comparable franchise sales. The dollar amount of both royalty income and advertising fund contributions increased as each is calculated
primarily as a fixed percentage of franchise sales.

Other revenue primarily comprises gift card breakage, which represents the value associated with the portion of gift cards sold that are unlikely to be redeemed,

Cost of sales, which comprises food and beverage costs, is variable and generally fluctuates with commodity costs and sales channel mix and volume. Cost of sales
as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 200 basis points in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by approximately 15.3% commodity
basket inflation, partially offset by menu price increases.

Labor costs include restaurant-level hourly wages and management salaries as well as related taxes and benefits. Labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue
decreased 20 basis points in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage, and lower management incentive compensation costs,
partially offset by wage rate inflation in 2022.

Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. In
2022, occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 50 basis points as compared to 2021 primarily driven by sales leverage and the impact of
permanently closed restaurants and lease amendments, partially offset by higher general liability costs.
Our fixed rents in 2022 and 2021 were $69.3 million and $68.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million due to the recognition of occupancy costs in Other charges for
temporarily closed Company-owned restaurants during periods of closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of lease amendments including a lease
modification that resulted in a financing lease becoming an operating lease, partially offset by decreases from 16 restaurants permanently closed during 2022 and 14
restaurants permanently closed during 2021.

General and administrative expenses increased $9.5 million or 12.6% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by increased
conference and travel costs following the ease of COVID-19 restrictions, higher share-based incentive compensation costs, and higher staffing costs.

Selling expenses increased $4.4 million or 9.3% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased digital marketing.

**Interest Expense and Interest Income**

Interest expense in 2022 and 2021 was $20.6 million and $14.2 million, respectively. The $6.5 million increase was primarily due to the increase in average total
debt and higher interest rates. Our weighted average interest rate in 2022 and 2021 was 9.1% and 7.1%.

Interest income and other decreased by $0.7 million to $0.0 million in 2022 from $0.7 million in 2021 due to interest income, primarily related to an income tax
refund, that was offset by investment losses, related to a deferred compensation plan for which assets are held in a rabbi trust, in 2022 compared to investment gains
related to the deferred compensation plan in 2021.

**Income Taxes**

Income tax provision was $0.7 million in 2022, compared to an income tax benefit of $0.2 million in 2021. Our effective tax rate was a 1.0% provision in 2022 and
a 0.3% benefit in 2021. The increase in tax expense for the year ended December 25, 2022, is primarily due to the 2022 impact of state taxes including minimum state
income taxes and state franchise taxes as well as an adjustment to federal taxes.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $35.4 million to $48.8 million at December 25, 2022, from $22.8 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is using available cash flow from operations to maintain existing restaurants and infrastructure, and execute on its long-term strategic initiatives. As of December 25, 2022, the Company had approximately $58.8 million in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility.

**Operating Cash Flows**

Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $11.8 million to $35.5 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The change in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to repayment of CARES Act deferred payroll tax of $8.8 million; $5.6 million higher interest payments due to the increased average total debt and higher interest rates; and decreased cash from earnings after non-cash items, as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, partially offset by changes in working capital, including the tax refunds received in 2022.

**Investing Cash Flows**

Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased $12.7 million to $29.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of a restaurant property and decreased spending on the DonatosⓇ expansion, partially offset by increased spending on restaurant improvements, and investments in technology and other projects.

Expenditures for DonatosⓇ expansion include expenditures for kitchen equipment, other equipment and other capital costs associated with adding DonatosⓇ to our restaurants, Restaurant improvement capital and other consists of capital equipment for our restaurants, Investment in technology, infrastructure and other consists of capital costs related to restaurant technology assets, capital overhead, and other items.

**Financing Cash Flows**

Net cash flows provided by financing activities increased $28.0 million to $29.5 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to $30.6 million in net borrowings in 2022 compared to a net borrowings of $3.7 million in 2021 as a result of the Company's refinancing of debt on March 4, 2022 and $3.9 million in initial deposit proceeds received related to the sale of a restaurant property in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by an increase in cash used for debt issuance costs.

**Credit Facility**

On March 4, 2022, the Company replaced its prior amended and restated Credit Agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") with a new Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), which provides for a new Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate ("ABR"), which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum.

As of December 25, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $205.7 million net of $8.3 million of unamortized deferred financing charges and discounts, of which $3.4 million was classified as current, in addition to amounts issued under letters of credit of $9.1 million. The amounts issued under letters of credit reduce the amount available under the Credit Facility but are not recorded as debt.

We are subject to a number of customary covenants under our Credit Facility, including limitations on additional borrowings, acquisitions, stock repurchases, sales of assets, and dividend payments, as well as a Total Net Leverage ratio covenant. As of December 25, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants applicable to our Credit Facility.

For additional information regarding our Credit Facility, see Note 8. Borrowings included within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

**Debt Outstanding**

Total debt outstanding increased $37.9 million to $214.9 million at December 25, 2022, from $177.0 million at December 26, 2021, primarily driven by net proceeds from the execution of the Credit Facility during the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2022.

**Share Repurchase**

On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company's current share repurchase program of up to a total of $75 million of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization will terminate upon completing repurchases of $75 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Pursuant to the repurchase program, purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock. From the date of the current program approval through December 25, 2022, we have repurchased a total of 226,500 shares at an average price of $29.14 per share for an aggregate amount of $6.6 million. There were no share repurchases in 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, as of December 25, 2022, we had $68.4 million of availability under the current share repurchase program.

Effective March 14, 2020, the Company suspended its share repurchase program to provide additional liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new Credit Agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares to certain conditions set forth by our lenders in the new Credit Facility.

(5) Other non-current liabilities primarily represent the employee deferred compensation plan liability. Refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Programs, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
**Financial Condition and Future Liquidity**
We require capital principally to maintain, improve, and refurbish existing restaurants; build new restaurants; support infrastructure needs; fund operational
changes; and for general operating purposes. We are required to make interest and principal payments under the terms of our Credit Agreement, and may use capital to
pay additional principal on our borrowings or repurchase our common stock as allowed by our Credit Agreement. Our primary short-term and long-term sources of
liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our Credit Facility. We expect cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under the Credit
Facility will be sufficient to meet debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. In January 2023, the
Company announced it is evaluating a sale-leaseback transaction related to its owned properties and anticipates proceeds will be used to repay debt, fund capital
investments, and repurchase shares of Company stock subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement and approval by the Board of Directors. We and the restaurant
industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories, and vendors generally grant short-term trade credit for purchases, such as food
and supplies. The addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants are reflected as long-term assets and not as part of working capital.
**Working Capital**
We typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a working capital
deficit because restaurant sales are primarily conducted on a cash or credit card basis. Rapid turnover of inventory results in limited investment in inventories, and cash
from sales is usually received before related payables for food, supplies, and payroll become due. In addition, receipts from the sale of gift cards are received well in
advance of related redemptions. Rather than maintain higher cash balances that would result from this pattern of operating cash flows, we typically utilize operating cash
flows in excess of those required for currently maturing liabilities to pay for capital expenditures, debt repayment, or to repurchase stock. When necessary, we utilize our
Credit Facility to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. We believe our future cash flows generated from restaurant operations combined with our remaining
borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and sale-leaseback transactions will be sufficient to satisfy any working capital deficits and our planned capital
expenditures.
**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**
Critical accounting policies and estimates are those we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often
because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors we
believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, including our estimates of future restaurant-level cash flows, which are
subject to the current economic environment, and we might obtain different results if we use different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following as the
Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require
management's most subjective and complex judgment. Information regarding the Company's other significant accounting policies is disclosed in Note 1, *Description of
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies*, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
*Impairment of Long-Lived Assets* - Long-lived assets, including restaurant sites, leasehold improvements, other fixed assets, right of use assets, and amortizable
intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present. Expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the
recoverability of the asset. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the restaurant-level. The estimate of cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain
assumptions about expected future operating performance, including assumptions on future revenue trends. Management's estimates of undiscounted cash flows may
differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes to our business model, or changes in operating performance. If the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we recognize an impairment loss. The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is determined using discounted cash flows.

# Table of Contents

Judgments made by management related to our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors
such as changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance, and the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets. As the ongoing expected cash
flows and carrying amounts of long-lived assets are assessed, these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge. Each restaurant's past and present
operating performance were reviewed in combination with projected future results, primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows, which indicated possible
impairment. For those restaurants for which undiscounted cash flows did not exceed their carrying value, we compared the carrying amount of each restaurant to its fair
value as estimated by management. Determining the fair value of the long-lived assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions and is typically determined using a
discounted cash flow projection model. The weighted average cost of capital discount factor is determined using external information such as the risk-free rate of return,
industry beta factors, and premium adjustments. Management uses other market information such as market rent and discount rates, which are subject to judgment, to
estimate the fair value of restaurant right of use lease assets. During 2022, the Company determined long-lived assets at 46 locations were impaired as a result of our
cash flow analysis, and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $38.0 million. During 2021, we impaired ten Company-owned restaurants as a result of our cash
flow analysis resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $6.4 million.

Information technology systems, such as internal-use computer software, are reviewed and tested for recoverability if the internal-use computer software is not
expected to provide substantive service potential, a significant change occurs to the extent or manner in which the software is used or is expected to be used, a significant
change is made or will be made to the software program, or costs of developing or modifying internal-use software significantly exceed the amount originally expected to
develop or modify the software. During 2020, the Company impaired information technology assets totaling $5.2 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic redirecting
our implementation of certain digital platforms in order to accelerate our speed to market.

Liquor licenses with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. We determine fair
value based on quoted prices in the active market for the license in the same or similar jurisdictions, representing a level 1 fair value measurement. At the end of 2022,
the Company performed its annual review of its indefinite lived liquor licenses that had a carrying value of $6.7 million, and recorded impairment charges of
$0.5 million to indefinite-lived intangibles in 2022. In 2021, $0.5 million of impairment charges were recorded and, in 2020, no impairment charges were recorded to
liquor licenses with indefinite lives.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
Under our Credit Facility, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to rates
based on SOFR plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds
Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum. As of December 25, 2022, we had $214.0 million of borrowings subject to variable
interest rates. A 1.0% change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre-tax interest expense fluctuation of $2.1 million on an
annualized basis.
We continue to monitor our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis and may use interest rate swaps or similar instruments in the future to manage our exposure to
interest rate changes related to our borrowings as the Company deems appropriate.
Commodity Price Risks
The Company's restaurant menus are highly dependent upon a few select commodities, including ground beef, poultry, potatoes, and restaurant supplies. We
purchase food, supplies and other commodities for use in our operations based on prices established with our suppliers. Many of the commodities purchased by us are
subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control, including the price of other commodities, weather, seasonality, production, trade
policy, and other factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced distribution disruptions, commodity cost inflation, and certain food and supply shortages. To
manage this risk in part, we enter into fixed-price purchase commitments for certain commodities; however, it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed-price
purchase commitments for certain commodities, or we may choose not to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities. We believe that substantially all of our
food and supplies meeting our specifications are available from alternate sources, which we have identified to diversify our supply chain to mitigate our overall
commodity risk. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to commodity price increases. A 1.0% increase in food
and beverage costs would negatively impact cost of sales by approximately $3.1 million on an annualized basis.
Many of the food products we purchase are affected by changes in weather, production, availability, seasonality, and other factors outside our control. In an effort
to mitigate some of this risk, we have entered into fixed price agreements on some of our food and beverage products, including certain proteins, produce, and cooking
oil. As of December 25, 2022, approximately 49% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are
scheduled to expire at various times through the end of 2023. These contracts may exclude related expenses such as fuel surcharges and other fees. In addition, we
believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources, which helps to reduce or mitigate these risks.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 25, 2022 and
December 26, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the periods ended December 25,
2022 and December 26, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
periods ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to
which it relates.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 9 in the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As of December 25, 2022, the Company had $318.5 million in property and equipment, net, $361.4 million in operating lease assets, net, and $7.6 million in finance
lease assets, net. The Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant-level whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. During 2022, the Company determined long-lived assets at 46 locations were impaired as a result of their cash flow
analysis and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $38.0 million.
Long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Expected cash flows
associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the restaurant-level. The estimate of cash
flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, including assumptions of future revenue trends. If the sum of
the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and measured as the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of the asset.
We identified the evaluation of long-lived asset impairment as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the
undiscounted cash flows, including assumptions about expected future operating performance, and the fair value of the lease assets. This required a high degree of auditor
judgment and an increased extent of effort, when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified and evaluated potential
impairment

indicators, and when evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions, particularly related to undiscounted cash flows and market rent.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the impairment of long-lived assets included the following, among others:

*   We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s assessment and evaluation of potential impairment indicators for long-lived assets and over forecasted undiscounted cash flows and market rent used in their recoverability and impairment analyses.
*   We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s evaluation of impairment indicators by:

    *   Evaluating the Company’s process for identifying qualitative and quantitative impairment indicators by location and whether the Company appropriately considered such indicators
    *   Conducting a completeness assessment to determine whether additional impairment indicators were present during the period that were not identified by the Company.
*   We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations and the underlying source of information for a selection of restaurant sites.
*   We evaluated the reasonableness of the information in the Company’s forecasted undiscounted cash flows used in their recoverability and impairment analyses, by comparing the forecasts to

    *   Historical actual information
    *   Internal communications between management and the Board of Directors
    *   Forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company.
*   We evaluated the Company’s forecasted undiscounted and discounted cash flows for consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.
*   With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the market rent by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the market rent used by management.

RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Description of Business
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries ("Red Robin," "we," "us," "our", or the "Company"), primarily operates,

The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include
the accounts of Red Robin and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company's fiscal year is 52 or
53 weeks ending the last Sunday of the calendar year. Year-end dates and the number of weeks in each fiscal year are shown in the table below for periods presented in

(c) Reclassifications
Certain amounts presented have been reclassified within the December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform with
the current period presentation, including prior year reclassifications from Other, net to Amortization of debt issuance costs. The reclassifications had no effect on the
Company's cash flows from operations.
(d) Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The areas that require management's most significant estimates are impairment of long-lived
assets, lease accounting, estimating fair value, and unearned revenue. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Change in Accounting Estimate - Gift Card Breakage
As part of its annual assessment of gift card breakage and during the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2022, the Company re-evaluated the estimated
redemption pattern related to gift cards and aligned the recognition of gift card breakage to the updated estimated redemption pattern. As a result, the Company
recognized $5.9 million of additional gift card breakage in Other revenues, partially offset by $0.6 million of associated commissions costs recognized in Selling, general
and administrative expenses, in the first quarter of 2022. This change in accounting estimate decreased net loss by $5.2 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share for
the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2022. The Company may record adjustments related to changes in estimated redemption patterns in the future which could be
material.
Change in Accounting Estimate - Red Robin Loyalty Breakage
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company re-evaluated the estimated redemption pattern related to Red Robin Royalty benefits and aligned the recognition of
loyalty breakage to the updated estimated redemption pattern. As a result, the Company recognized an additional $2.9 million of loyalty breakage in Restaurant revenue.
The Company re-evaluates the estimated redemption pattern related to Red Robin Royalty each year and may record adjustments related to changes in estimated
redemption patterns in the future which could be material.

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant Guest, franchisee, or other customer.

The Company recognizes revenues from restaurant operations when payment is tendered at the point of sale, as the Company's performance obligation to provide food and beverage to the customer has been satisfied.

The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date, and it does not deduct dormancy fees from outstanding gift card balances. We recognize revenue from gift cards as either: (i) Restaurant revenue, when the Company's performance obligation to provide food and beverage to the customer is satisfied upon redemption of the gift card, or (ii) gift card breakage, as discussed below.

Gift card breakage is recognized when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote and the Company determines there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balance to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon the Company's specific historical redemption patterns. The Company recognizes gift card breakage by applying its estimate of the rate of gift card breakage on a pro rata basis over the period of estimated redemption.

Red Robin Royalty™ deferred revenue primarily relates to a program in which registered members earn an award for a free entrée for everynine entrées purchased. Registered members can also earn an award if they visit a Red Robin restaurant 5 separate times within 5 weeks of joining our Royalty™ program. We recognize the current sale of an entrée and defer a portion of the revenue to reflect partial prepayment for the future entrée the member is entitled to receive. We estimate the future value of the award based on the historical average value of redemptions. We also estimate what portion of registered members are not likely to reach the ninth purchase or fifth visit based on historical activity and recognize the revenue related to those purchases from deferred revenue. We recognize the deferred revenue in restaurant revenue on earned rewards when the Company satisfies its performance obligation at redemption, or upon expiration. We compare the estimate of the value of future awards to historical redemptions to evaluate the reasonableness of the deferred amount.

Revenues we receive from our franchise arrangements include sales-based royalties, advertising fund contributions, area development fees, and franchise fees. Red Robin franchisees are required to remit 4.0% to 5.0% of their revenues as royalties to the Company and contribute up to 3% of revenues to two national advertising funds. The Company recognizes these sales-based royalties and advertising fund contributions as the underlying franchisee sales occur. Contributions to these Advertising Funds from franchisees are recorded as revenue under Franchise revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in accordance with ASC Topic 606, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*.

The Company also provides its franchisees with management expertise, training, pre-opening assistance, and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees and franchise fees. The Company capitalizes these fees upon collection from the franchisee, which then amortize over the contracted franchise term as the services comprising the performance obligation are satisfied. The Company typically grants franchise rights to franchisees for a term of 20 years, with the right to extend the term for an additional 10 years if various conditions are satisfied by the franchisee.

Other revenue consists of gift card breakage, licensing income, and recycling income.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash** - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card issuers are typically converted to cash within two to four days of the original sales transaction and are considered to be cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. The Company holds cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions in excess of amounts covered by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and sometimes invests excess cash in money market funds not insured by the FDIC. The Company periodically assesses the credit risk associated with these financial institutions and believes that the risk of loss is minimal.

The Company is required to carry restricted cash balances that are reserved as collateral for existing letters of credit. The amounts issued under letters of credit, which are undrawn and expire in June 2023, totaled $9.1 million.

**Accounts Receivable, Net**- Accounts receivable, net consists primarily of third party gift card receivables, third party delivery partner receivables, trade receivables due from franchisees for royalties and advertising fund contributions, and tenant improvement allowances. At the end of 2022, there was approximately $11.6 million of gift card receivables in accounts receivable related to gift cards that were sold by third party retailers compared to $0.9 million at the end of 2021. At the end of

2022, there was also approximately $2.3 million related to third party delivery partners in accounts receivable compared to approximately $3.0 million at the end of
2021.
Inventories - Inventories consist of food, beverages, and supplies valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value At the end of 2022
and 2021, food and beverage inventories were $10.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively, and supplies inventories were $16.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively.
Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor
replacements, maintenance, and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method based on the shorter of the estimated useful lives
or the terms of the underlying leases of the related assets. Interest incurred on funds used to construct Company-owned restaurants is capitalized and amortized over the
estimated useful life of the related assets.
The estimated useful lives for property and equipment are:

<table>
<tr><th></th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>Buildings</td><td>5 years to 20 years</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leasehold improvements</td><td>Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life, not to exceed 20 years</td></tr>
<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures, and equipment</td><td>5 years to 20 years</td></tr>
<tr><td>Computer equipment</td><td>2 years to 5 years</td></tr>
</table>

The Company capitalizes certain overhead related to the development and construction of its new restaurants as well as certain information technology
infrastructure upgrades. Costs incurred for the potential development of restaurants that are subsequently terminated are expensed.
Leases - The Company leases land, buildings, and equipment used in its operations under operating and finance leases. Our leases generally have remaining terms
of 1-15 years, most of which include options to extend the leases for additional5-year periods. Generally, the lease term is the minimum of the non-cancelable period of
the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods up to a term of 20 years.
We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease
liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the
operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To
determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. We estimate
this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and management judgment.
Our leases typically contain rent escalations over the lease term. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally,
tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce our right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the
right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term.
Some of our leases include rent escalations based on inflation indexes and fair market value adjustments. Certain leases contain contingent rental provisions that
include a fixed base rent plus an additional percentage of the restaurant's sales in excess of stipulated amounts. Operating lease liabilities are calculated using the
prevailing index or rate at lease commencement. Subsequent escalations in the index or rate and contingent rental payments are recognized as variable lease
expenses. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all applicable classes of underlying assets. Short-term disclosures include only those leases with a
term of 12 months or less, and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, that do not include an
option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise, are not recorded on the balance sheet.
We elected the practical expedient that does not require us to separate lease and non-lease components for our population of real estate assets.
Intangible Assets, net - Intangible assets comprise primarily leasehold interests, acquired franchise rights, and the costs of purchased liquor licenses. Leasehold
interests primarily represent the fair values of acquired lease contracts having contractual rents lower than fair market rents and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the remaining initial lease term. Acquired franchise rights, which represent the acquired value of franchise contracts, are amortized over the term of the franchise
agreements. The costs of obtaining non-transferable liquor licenses from local government agencies are capitalized and generally amortized over a period of up to 20
years. The costs of purchasing transferable liquor licenses through open markets in jurisdictions with a limited number of authorized liquor licenses are capitalized as
indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Liquor licenses with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. We determine fair
value based on prices in the open market for license in same or similar jurisdictions. Impairment charges of $0.5 million were recorded related to indefinite-lived
intangibles in 2022 and $0.5 million were recorded in 2021. No impairment charges were recorded in 2020.

**Impairment of Long-Lived Assets** - The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including restaurant sites, leasehold improvements, other fixed assets,
information technology systems, right of use assets, and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent
of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities, generally at the restaurant-level. If the assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined using projected cash flows discounted
using an estimated weighted average cost of capital. Management may also utilize other market information to determine fair value such as market rent and discount
rates, to estimate the fair value of restaurant right of use lease assets. Restaurant sites and other assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount
or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Information technology systems, such as internal-use computer software, are reviewed and tested for recoverability if the
internal-use computer software is not expected to provide substantive service potential, a significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software is used
or is expected to be used, a significant change is made or will be made to the software program, or costs of developing or modifying internal-use software significantly
exceed the amount originally expected to develop or modify the software.

**Other Assets, net** - Other assets, net consist primarily of assets related to various deposits, the employee deferred compensation plan, and unamortized debt
issuance costs on the revolving Credit Facility. Debt issuance costs on the revolving Credit Facility are capitalized and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line
basis which approximates the effective interest rate method over the term of the Company's long-term debt.

**Advertising** - Under the Company's franchise agreements, both the Company and the franchisees must contribute up to3.0% of revenues to two national media
advertising funds (the "Advertising Funds"). These Advertising Funds are used to build the Company's brand equity and awareness primarily through a national
marketing strategy, including national television advertising, digital media, social media programs, email, loyalty, and public relations initiatives.

Total advertising costs of $35.7 million, $34.3 million, and $24.9 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020 and were included in Selling, general, and administrative
expenses.

Advertising production costs are expensed in the period when the advertising first takes place. Other advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

**Self-Insurance Programs** - The Company utilizes a self-insurance plan for health, general liability, and workers' compensation coverage. Predetermined loss
limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit the Company's per occurrence cash outlay. Accrued liabilities and other current liabilities and accrued
payroll and payroll-related liabilities include the estimated cost to settle reported claims and incurred but unreported claims.

**Legal Contingencies** - In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are uncertain. We record
an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. In making
such determinations we evaluate, among other things, the probability of an unfavorable outcome, and when we believe it probable that a liability has been incurred, our
ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss.

**Pre-opening Costs** - Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-opening costs include rental expenses through the date of opening for each restaurant, travel
expenses, wages, and benefits for the training and opening teams, as well as food, beverage, and other restaurant opening costs incurred prior to a restaurant opening for
business. Costs related to preparing restaurants to introduce Donatos® will be expensed as incurred and included in pre-opening costs.

**Income Taxes** - Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the estimated effects of all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized for the
estimated effects of all deductible temporary differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon
profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. However, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be
adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are increased or reduced or if there are differences in the timing or amount of future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.

Pursuant to the guidance for uncertain tax positions, a taxpayer must be able to more likely than not sustain a position to recognize a tax benefit, and the
measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Reference Rate Reform

In March 2020, FASB issued Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This update provides temporary optional expedients to applying the reference rate reform guidance to contracts that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. Under this update, contract modifications resulting in a new reference rate may be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract. This guidance is effective upon issuance of the update and applies to contract modifications made through December 31, 2022. We adopted Topic 848 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 in conjunction with the refinancing of our Credit Facility and its associated transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), noting it did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss upon adoption.

We reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

our fiscal calendar.

**Credit Facility**

On March 4, 2022, the Company replaced its prior amended and restated Credit Agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") with a new Credit Agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, Red Robin International, Inc., as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, the issuing banks from
time to time party thereto, Fortress Credit Corp., as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole
Bookrunner. The five-year $225.0 million Credit Agreement provides for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit and a $200.0 million term loan (collectively, the
"Credit Facility"). The borrower maintains the option to increase the Credit Facility in the future, subject to lenders' participation, by up to an additional $40.0 million in
the aggregate on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Facility will mature on March 4, 2027. No amortization is required with respect to the revolving Credit Facility. The term loans require quarterly
principal payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the term loan. The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base
Rate ("ABR"), which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum.
The variable interest rates were 9.81% for the term loan and 10.44% for the revolving line of credit as of December 25, 2022.

As of December 25, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $205.7 million net of $8.3 million of unamortized deferred
financing charges and discounts, of which $3.4 million was classified as current. As of December 26, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the credit
facility under the Prior Credit Agreement of $176.1 million, of which $9.7 million was classified as current, in addition to amounts issued under letters of credit of $7.9
million.

Red Robin International, Inc., is the borrower under the Credit Agreement, and certain of its subsidiaries and the Company are guarantors of borrower's
obligations under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors,
including the Company, and are available to: (i) refinance certain existing indebtedness of the borrower and its subsidiaries, (ii) pay any fees and expenses in connection
with the Credit Agreement, and (iii) provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of the Company, the borrower and its subsidiaries, including
permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures, but excluding restricted payments.

On March 4, 2022, Red Robin International, Inc., the Company, and the guarantors also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement")
granting to the Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors to secure the obligations under the
Credit Agreement. This new Security Agreement replaced the existing security agreement, dated January 10, 2020, which was entered into in connection with the Prior
Credit Agreement.

Red Robin International, Inc., as the borrower is obligated to pay customary fees to the agents, lenders and issuing banks under the Credit Agreement with respect
to providing, maintaining, or administering, as applicable, the credit facilities.

In connection with entry into the new Credit Agreement, the Company's Prior Credit Agreement was terminated. In connection with such termination and new
borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, the Company paid off all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest, and fees under the Prior Credit Agreement.

The summary descriptions of the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
full text of the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement, respectively, which were filed as exhibits to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2022.

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing charges related to the extinguishment of the Prior Credit Agreement on March 4, 2022. These charges were recorded to interest expense, net and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2022. In association with the execution of the new Credit Agreement, the Company recognized $4.8 million of deferred financing charges and $6.1 million of original issuance discount.

9. Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurements are made under a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the measuring of fair value:

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quote prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments.

The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund obligations under a deferred compensation plan. See Note 15. Employee Benefit Programs. Amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value and are included in Other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Fair market value of mutual funds is measured using level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets).

The following tables present the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021 (in thousands):

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, right of use assets, and intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired.

During 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company measured non-financial assets for impairment using continuing and projected future cash flows, as discussed in Note 4. Other Charges (Gains), net, which were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level 3 fair value measurement.

Based on our 2022, 2021, and 2020 impairment analyses, we impaired long-lived assets at 46, 10 and 40 locations with carrying values of $80.4 million, $13.7 million, and $67.3 million. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets in 2022, 2021, and 2020 to be $2.4 million, $7.2 million and $34.7 million based on level 3 fair value measurements.

Liquor licenses with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. We determine fair
value based on quoted prices in the active market for the license in the same or similar jurisdictions, representing a level 1 fair value measurement. During the fourth
quarter of 2022, the Company performed its annual review of its indefinite lived liquor licenses that had a carrying value of $6.7 million, and recorded impairment
charges of $0.5 million to indefinite-lived intangibles in 2022. Impairment charges of $0.5 million were recorded to liquor licenses with indefinite lives in 2021 andno
impairment charges were recorded in 2020.

Disclosures of Fair Value of Other Assets and Liabilities

The Company's liability under its Credit Facility is carried at historical cost in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of December 25, 2022, the fair
value of the Credit Facility was approximately $205.1 million and the principal amount carrying value was $214.0 million. The Credit Facility term loan is reported net
of $8.3 million in unamortized discount and debt issuance costs in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2022. The carrying value approximated the fair
value of the Credit Facility as of December 26, 2021, as the interest rate on the instrument approximated current market rates. The interest rate on the Credit Facility
represents a level 2 fair value input.

The increase in tax expense for the year ended December 25, 2022, is primarily due to the 2022 impact of state taxes including minimum state income taxes and
state franchise taxes as well as an adjustment to federal taxes. The decrease in the Company's effective tax benefit in 2021 is primarily due to the 2020 favorable rate
impact of net operating loss carrybacks allowed as part of the CARES Act.

The Company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of $48.3 million as of December 25, 2022. This is comprised of approximately $21.8 million of federal net operating loss carryovers, approximately $17.6 million of state net operating loss carryovers, and approximately $8.9 million of foreign net operating loss carryovers. The federal net operating loss has an indefinite carryforward period, the state net operating loss carryovers expire at various dates between 2025 and 2042, and the foreign net operating loss carryovers expire at various dates between 2035 and 2042.

As of December 25, 2022, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $39.6 million related to federal tax credits, which expire at various dates between 2037 and 2041. The Company also had a deferred tax asset of $1.2 million related to state tax credits which expire in 2024.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that it will not realize some portion or all the tax benefit of its deferred income tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including historical operating losses, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In 2020, management determined that a full valuation allowance was required and has recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 25, 2022 and at December 26, 2021.

Based on the Company’s evaluation of its deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of approximately $116.3 million has been recorded against the deferred tax asset for federal and state tax credits, federal and state deferred tax assets, all net operating loss carry forwards and the deferred taxes of our foreign subsidiary.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not
anticipate significant changes in the aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, other than nominal tax settlements.
The Company had outstanding federal and state refund claims of approximately $0.6 million as of December 25, 2022.

*Recent Tax Legislation*

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 were signed into law by President Biden on August 9, 2022 and
August 16, 2022, respectively. The legislation introduces new options for monetizing certain credits, a corporate alternative minimum tax, and a stock repurchase excise
tax. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of CHIPS and IRA, but at present does not expect that any of the provisions included in these Acts would result in a
material impact to our deferred tax assets, liabilities, or income taxes payable.

**12. Commitments and Contingencies**

Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving highly subjective judgment about
potential outcomes of future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including
the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the claim or claims in question, the presence of
complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation
against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure.
Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures each quarter in consultation with legal counsel, and we assess the probability and range of possible
losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the consolidated financial statements. However, the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from
our current estimates.

In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, administrative proceedings, and other contingencies. These include
employment related claims and class action lawsuits, claims from Guests or Team Members alleging illness, injury, food quality, health, or operational concerns, and
lease and other commercial disputes. To date, none of these claims, certain of which are covered by insurance policies, have had a material effect on the Company.
While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these suits, legal proceedings, and claims with certainty, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for
potential losses associated with these matters has been made in the financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position and results of operations. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in
greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

As of December 25, 2022, we had a balance of $7.7 million for loss contingencies on our consolidated balance sheets, of which $3.0 million relates to a class
action settlement that is scheduled to be paid in first quarter 2023. We increased our estimate of loss contingency liabilities by approximately $4.1 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 related to changes during the fourth quarter in the status ongoing litigation matters. We ultimately may be subject to greater or less than the accrued
amount for this and other matters.

As of December 25, 2022, we had purchase commitments to certain vendors who provide food and beverages and other supplies to our restaurants, for an
aggregate of $142.1 million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such, no liability has been recorded.

13. Stockholders' Equity
On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized an increase to the Company's share repurchase program of approximately $21 million to a total of
$75 million of the Company's common stock. The increased share repurchase authorization became effective on August 9, 2018 and will terminate upon completing
repurchases of $75 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made in open market or
privately negotiated transactions. Purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion, and the timing and amount of any share repurchases will be
determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any
particular amount of common stock, and the Company may suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time. In 2022, the Company did not repurchase any
shares under its share repurchase program. From the date of the current program approval through December 25, 2022, we have repurchased a total of 226,500 shares at
an average price of $29.14 per share for an aggregate amount of $6.6 million. Accordingly, as of December 25, 2022, we had $68.4 million of availability under the
current share repurchase program.
14. Stock Incentive Plans
In May 2017, the Company's stockholders approved the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2017 Stock Plan"). Following the date of approval, all grants are
made under the 2017 Stock Plan and no new awards may be granted under the Second Amended and Restated 2007 Performance Plan (the "2007 Stock Plan"). The 2017
Stock Plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company common stock
or unit of the Company's common stock, as well as cash performance awards pursuant to the plan. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Stock Plan include
officers, employees, directors, consultants, and other service providers or any affiliate of the Company. The maximum number of shares of the Company's common
stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2017 Stock Plan was 630,182 shares. The 2017 Stock Plan was amended in May 2019, and again in
May 2020 to add an additional 660,000 and 275,000 shares, respectively, bringing the total to 1,565,182 shares as of December 25, 2022.
Vesting of the awards under the 2017 Stock Plan is determined at the date of grant by the plan administrator. Each award granted under the 2017 Stock Plan and
2007 Stock Plan fully vests, becomes exercisable and/or payable, as applicable, upon a change in control event. However, unless the individual award agreement
provides otherwise, with respect to executive and certain other high level officers, upon the occurrence of a change in control, no award will vest unless such officers'
employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without cause during the two years following such change in control event. Each award expires on such
date as shall be determined at the date of grant; however, the maximum term of options, SARs, and other rights to acquire common stock under the plan is ten years
after the initial date of the award, subject to provisions for further deferred payment in certain circumstances. Vesting of awards under these plans were generally time
based over a period of one year to four years. As of December 25, 2022, 198,958 options and awards to acquire the Company's common stock remained outstanding
under the 2007 Stock Plan; all remaining options and awards are outstanding under the 2017 Stock Plan.
Stock-based compensation costs recognized in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $6.3 million, $6.6 million, and $4.3 million with related income tax benefits of $0.6
million, $1.4 million, and $0.3 million. The 2022 costs were comprised of $9.6 million stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $3.3 million reduction due to
executive team forfeitures recorded in Other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
As of December 25, 2022, there was $8.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost, excluding estimated forfeitures. Unrecognized compensation costs are
expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately 0.25 years for stock options, 0.92 years for the restricted stock units
("RSU"), and 1.71 years for the performance stock units ("PSU").

(1) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding options. The Company applies estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from
our historical forfeitures of similar awards.

The estimated fair value of each option granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes multiple option-pricing model, and expense is recognized straight line over
the vesting period. No options were granted during 2022 or 2021. The average assumptions used in the model for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2022, December
26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 were as follows:

|       | 2020 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Risk-free interest rate | 0.5 % |
| Expected years until exercise | 4.7 |
| Expected stock volatility | 61.0 % |
| Dividend yield | — % |
| Weighted average Black-Scholes fair value per share at date of grant | $ 6.28 |

Total intrinsic value of options exercised was $4 thousand, $89 thousand, and $30 thousand in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the rate for zero coupon U.S. Government issues with a remaining term similar to the expected life. The expected life of the
options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends and Team Member exercise patterns. The expected stock
price volatility represents an average of the Company's historical volatility measured over a period approximating the expected life. The dividend yield assumption is
based on the Company's history and expectations of dividend payouts.

Time-Based RSUs

During 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company issued time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain employees as permitted under the 2017 Stock Plan. The
Company can grant RSUs to its directors, executive officers, and other key employees. The RSUs granted to employees typically vest in equal installments over three to
four years. For the Company's board of directors, RSUs vest in full on the earlier of theone-year anniversary of the grant date or the next annual stockholder meeting.
Upon vesting, one share of the Company's common stock is issued for each RSU. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock
at the date of grant, and expense is recognized straight line over the vesting period.

The table below summarizes the status of the Company's time-based RSUs under the 2017 and 2007 Stock Plans (shares in thousands):

Restricted Stock Units

|       | Shares | Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Outstanding, December 26, 2021 | 419 | $ 28.89 |
| Awarded | 339 | 14.70 |

Performance Stock Units

During 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company granted performance stock unit awards (“PSUs”) to certain employees as permitted under the 2017 Stock Plan. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock on the payment date.

Prior to 2020, each PSU was divided into three equal tranches with applicable performance periods, typically consisting of a fiscal year, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance goals at target and applicable vesting conditions. Fair value of each PSU granted was equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the grant date, and expense is recognized ratably across the total performance period based on probability of achieving applicable performance goals. PSUs remain unvested until the end of the third performance period and are forfeited in the event of termination of employment of a grantee prior to the last day of the third performance period.

Beginning in 2020, the Company began granting PSU awards based on relative total stockholder return defined as increases in the Company’s stock price during a performance period of three years as compared to the total stockholder return of a group of peer companies. Fair value of each PSU granted is determined by a Monte Carlo valuation model, and expense is recognized straight line over the performance period. PSUs remain unvested until the last day of the three year performance period and are generally forfeited in the event of termination of employment of a grantee prior to the last day of the three year performance period. If the relative total stockholder return target is not met, compensation cost for these PSUs is not reversed.

companies. Compensation is recognized variably over the 3-year performance period based on a Monte Carlo valuation model. Beginning in 2017, the long-term cash incentive plan was based on operational metrics with 3 one-year performance periods. Compensation expense for awards granted before 2020 is recognized variably over the performance period based on the plan-to-date performance achievement. All long-term cash incentive awards cliff vest after 3 years at the end of each performance cycle. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded $(0.4) million, $0.5 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, in compensation expense to Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the 2017 long-term cash incentive plan. The amounts recorded in 2022 include the reversal of the expense related to 2020 grants for which performance targets were not met.

During 2022 and 2021, the long-term cash incentive plan payout totaled $0.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively. At December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, a $0.6 million and $1.0 million long-term cash incentive plan liability was included in Accrued payroll and payroll-related liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

15. Employee Benefit Programs

Employee Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company offers a deferred compensation plan that permits key employees and other members of management defined as highly compensated employees under the IRS code to defer portions of their compensation in a pre-tax savings vehicle that allows for retirement savings above 401(k) limits. Under this plan, eligible Team Members may elect to defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of variable compensation and commissions each plan year.

The assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust, where they are invested in certain mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments and are available to satisfy the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. These mutual funds have published market prices and are reported at fair value. See Note 9. Fair Value Measurements. Changes in the market value of the investments held in the trust result in the recognition of a corresponding gain or loss reported in Interest income and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. A corresponding change in the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan results in an offsetting compensation expense, or reduction of expense, reported in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

The Company recognized a $0.8 million decrease in deferred compensation expense in 2022, and an increase in deferred compensation expense of $0.7 million in 2021 and $0.6 million in 2020. As of December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, $4.3 million and $6.3 million of deferred compensation assets are included in Other current assets, net and $4.3 million and $6.3 million of deferred compensation plan liabilities are included in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In July 2017, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP Plan"). The ESPP Plan authorized 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock for issuance. In May 2020, our board of directors authorized the issuance of an additional 150,000 shares of the Company's common stock under the ESPP Plan. In December 2022, our board of directors authorized the issuance of an additional 350,000 shares of the Company's common stock under the ESPP Plan to a total of 600,000 shares. Under the ESPP Plan, eligible Team Members may voluntarily contribute up to 15% of their salary, subject to limitations, to purchase common stock at a price equal to85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the first day of each offering period or 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the last day of each offering period, whichever amount is less. In general, all of the Company's officers and Team Members who have been employed by the Company for at least one year and who are regularly scheduled to work more than 20 hours per week are eligible to participate in this plan, which operates in the successive six months commencing on January 1 and July 1 of each fiscal year. During 2022, the Company issued a total of63,841 shares under the ESPP Plan with 55,585 shares available for future issuance. During 2021, the Company issued a total of42,563 shares under the ESPP Plan.

For 2022, in accordance with the guidance for accounting for stock compensation, the Company estimated the fair value of the awards granted pursuant to the stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes multiple-option pricing model. The assumptions used in the model included risk-free interest rates from 1.84% to 4.05%, 0.5 year expected life, expected volatilities from 54.13% to 55.00%, and 0% dividend yield. The weighted average fair value per share at grant date was $4.36. For 2021, the assumptions used in the model included 0.31% risk-free interest rate, 0.5 year expected life, expected volatility of 53.94%, and 0% dividend yield. The weighted average fair value per share at grant date was $2.16. The Company recognized $0.1 million of compensation expense related to this plan in 2022, $0.2 million in 2021, and $0.1 million in 2020.

## Employee Defined Contribution Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) Savings Plan ("401k Plan") which covers eligible Team Members who have satisfied the service requirements and reached
21 years of age. The 401k Plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, allows Team Members to defer specified percentages of their
compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company may make matching contributions in an amount determined by the board of directors. In addition, the Company may
contribute each period, at its discretion, an additional amount from profits. Employer matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% of compensation and 50% on
the next 2% of compensation. The Company matches contributions when the employee contribution is made, and the employer matching contributions are not subject to
a vesting schedule. The Company recognized matching contribution expense of $2.9 million in 2022, $2.8 million in 2021, and $2.5 million in 2020.

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of such period, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are:

*   Recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and

*   Accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

*   Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

*   Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

*   Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 25, 2022, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting included herein.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and misstatements are prevented or detected. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.

Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 25, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
