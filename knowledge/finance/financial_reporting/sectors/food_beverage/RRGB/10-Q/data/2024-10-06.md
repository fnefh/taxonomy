## Reclassifications

Certain amounts presented have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Company's consolidated results. We made adjustments to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) to disaggregate franchise and other revenue and to disaggregate interest expense and interest income and other, net. Additionally, we made adjustments to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to disaggregate borrowings and repayments on revolving credit facilities, repayments on the term loan and finance lease obligations and to reclassify gift card breakage within unearned revenue.

In December 2023, FASB issued Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures which updates income tax disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendment also provides further disclosure comparability. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively. However, retrospective application is permitted. We do not expect these amended disclosures will have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.

In November 2023, FASB issued Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

We reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition - Revenues consist of sales from restaurant operations (including third party delivery), franchise revenue, and other revenue including gift card breakage and miscellaneous revenue. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant Guest, franchisee, or other customer.

The Company recognizes revenues from restaurant operations when payment is tendered at the point of sale, as the Company's performance obligation to provide food and beverage to the customer has been satisfied.

The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date, and it does not deduct dormancy fees from outstanding gift card balances. We recognize revenue from gift cards as either: (i) Restaurant revenue, when the Company's performance obligation to provide food and beverage to the customer is satisfied upon redemption of the gift card, or (ii) gift card breakage, as discussed below.

Gift card breakage is recognized when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote and the Company determines there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balance to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon the Company's specific historical redemption patterns. The Company recognizes gift card breakage by applying its estimate of the rate of gift card breakage on a pro rata basis over the period of estimated redemption.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we re-launched our Red Robin Royalty program ("Royalty"). Under the re-launched program, Royalty members generally earn points for every dollar spent. We may also periodically offer promotions, which typically provide the customer with the opportunity to earn bonus points or other rewards. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, Royalty members earn rewards that may be redeemed for food and beverage items. Earned rewards generally expire 90 days after they are issued, and points generally expire if a qualifying purchase is not made within 365 days of the last purchase. We defer revenue based on the estimated stand-alone selling price of points or rewards earned by customers as each point or reward is earned, net of points or rewards we do not expect to be redeemed. Our estimate of points and rewards expected to be redeemed is based on historical Company-specific data. We evaluate Royalty redemption rates annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. Estimating future redemption rates requires judgment based on current and historical trends, and actual redemption rates may vary from our estimates. TM

Revenues we receive from our franchise arrangements include sales-based royalties, advertising fund contributions, and franchise fees. Red Robin franchisees are required to remit 4.0% to 5.0% of their revenues as royalties to the Company and contribute up to 3% of revenues to two national advertising funds. The Company recognizes these sales-based royalties and advertising fund contributions as the underlying franchisee sales occur. Contributions to these Advertising Funds from franchisees are recorded as revenue under Franchise revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .

The Company typically grants franchise rights to franchisees for a term of20 years, with the right to extend the term for an additional10 years if various conditions are satisfied by the franchisee.

Other revenue consists of gift card breakage, licensing income, and recycling income.

## 4. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated based upon the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if holders of options exercised their options into common stock. As the Company was in a net loss position for both the quarter to date and year to date periods ended October 6, 2024, all potentially dilutive common shares are considered anti-dilutive.

The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding stock options and awards.Basic weighted average shares outstanding is reconciled to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows (in thousands):

## Credit Agreement

On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, Red Robin International, Inc., as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, the issuing banks from time to time party thereto, Fortress Credit Corp., as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner. The five-year $240.0 million Credit Agreement provides for a $40.0 million revolving line of credit and a $200.0 million term loan (collectively, the "Credit Facility"). The borrower maintains the option to increase the Credit Facility in the future, subject to lenders' participation, by up to an additional $40.0 million in the aggregate on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Facility will mature on March 4, 2027. No amortization is required with respect to the revolving line of credit. The term loans require quarterly principal payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the term loan. Quarterly principal payments are no longer required as a result of the debt repayments from the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transactions. The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate, which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus1.0% per annum.

In addition, the Company had amounts issued under letters of credit of $8.1 million and $7.7 million as of October 6, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Red Robin International, Inc., is the borrower under the Credit Agreement, and certain of its subsidiaries and the Company are guarantors of the borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors, including the Company, and are available to: (i) refinance certain existing indebtedness of the borrower and its subsidiaries, (ii) pay any fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, and (iii) provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of the Company, the borrower and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures, but excluding restricted payments.

On March 4, 2022, Red Robin International, Inc., the Company, and the guarantors also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement") granting to the Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement.

Red Robin International, Inc. as the borrower is obligated to pay customary fees to the agents, lenders and issuing banks under the Credit Agreement with respect to providing, maintaining, or administering, as applicable, the credit facilities.

On July 17, 2023, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment") to, among other things, remove the previously included $50.0 million aggregate cap on sale-leasebacks of Company-owned real property that are permitted under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment, among other things, provides certain relief from the financial covenant by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by $15.0 million to $40.0 million through the end of the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50% per annum and that are ABR-based loans to 6.50% per annum; and adds certain additional reporting requirements.

In conjunction with the execution of the Second Amendment, the Company paid certain customary amendment fees to the lenders under the credit facility totaling approximately $2.9 million. The Company performed an analysis of the Second Amendment under ASC Topic 470, Debt , and determined that debt modification accounting was appropriate for our term loan and revolving line of credit due to the change in total capacity and the increase in applicable margin interest rates under the new amendment. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company capitalized $2.7 million of the amendment fees as deferred loan fees which will be amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility, and expensed the remaining $0.2 million of fees.

The summary descriptions of the Credit Agreement, the Security Agreement, the First Amendment, and the Second Amendment, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement, each of which was filed February 28, 2024, as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the Second Amendment which was filed August 22, 2024 as an exhibit to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 14, 2024.

On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment"). See Note 9. Subsequent Event.

## 7. Fair Value Measurements

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments.

The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund obligations under a deferred compensation plan. Amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value and are included in Other assets, net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair market value of mutual funds is measured using level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets).

The following tables present the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, right of use assets, and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired.

During 2024 and 2023, the Company measured non-financial assets for impairment using continuing and projected future cash flows, which were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level 3 fair value measurement.

During the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024, we impaired long-lived assets atthree and five restaurant locations, respectively, with a carrying value of approximately $1.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be $1.1 million and $2.0 million as a result of the closures, resulting in a $0.2 million and $1.3 million impairment charge and a $0.6 million and $1.7 million decrease in right of use assets due to remeasurement for the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024, respectively. During the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2023, we impaired long-lived assets at eight and twelve restaurant locations, respectively. We also impaired the closed corporate office during the year to date period of 2023. The carrying value of the assets impaired in the third quarter of 2023 was $15.3 million and the carrying value of the assets impaired during the year to date period of 2023 was $27.7 million. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be $10.5 million and $20.5 million, resulting in a $4.8 million and $7.2 million impairment charge during the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2023, respectively.

## Disclosures of Fair Value of Other Assets and Liabilities

The Company's liability under its Credit Facility is carried at historical cost in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 6, 2024, the fair value of the Credit Facility was approximately $178.0 million and the principal amount carrying value was $187.9 million. The Credit Facility term loan is reported net of $7.2 million in unamortized discount and debt issuance costs in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 6, 2024. The carrying value of the Credit Facility was $189.1 million and the fair value of the Credit Facility was $186.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The interest rate on the Credit Facility represents a level 2 fair value input.

## 8. Commitments and Contingencies

Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving highly subjective judgment about potential outcomes of future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the claim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures each quarter in consultation with legal counsel, and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current estimates.

As of October 6, 2024, we had reserves of $8.3 million for loss contingencies included within Accrued liabilities and other on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, administrative proceedings, and other contingencies. These include employment related claims and class action lawsuits, claims from Guests or Team Members alleging illness, injury, food quality, health, or operational concerns, and lease and other commercial disputes. To date, none of these claims, certain of which are covered by insurance policies, have had a material effect on the Company. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these suits, legal proceedings, and claims with certainty, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for potential losses associated with these matters has been made in the financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

As of October 6, 2024, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments primarily related to certain vendors who provide food and beverage and other supplies to our restaurants, for an aggregate of $188.1 million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such, no liability has been recorded.

## 9. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to:

- · increase the permitted Maximum Net Total Leverage Ratio beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025 through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026;
- · maintain the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement at $40 million through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026. The revolving commitments were previously scheduled to be reduced to $25 million at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2025.

In conjunction with the Third Amendment, the Company paid certain customary amendment fees to the lenders under the credit facility totaling approximately $1.6 million, which will be added to the term loan and payable at maturity. Terms in this section that are capitalized but not defined have the meanings given to them in the Third Amendment. The summary description of the Third Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety to the full text of the Third Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

## Comparable Restaurant Revenue

As of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company revised its definition of comparable restaurant revenue to reflect Company-owned restaurants that have operated for 18 months as of the beginning of the period presented. The prior definition included Company-owned restaurants that have operated for five full quarters as of the beginning of the period presented. The Company believes this change will provide investors with a better understanding of our financial performance from period to period. The change did not have a material impact on previously reported results and as such, prior periods were not revised to reflect the new definition.

For the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024, there were 402 and 401 comparable restaurants, respectively.

The following table presents total Company-owned and franchised restaurants by state or province as of October 6, 2024:

Restaurant revenue, which is comprised primarily of food and beverage sales, decreased $2.5 million, or 0.9%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to the comparable period of 2023. Restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to the closure of 9 locations subsequent to October 1, 2023. Comparable restaurant revenue increased 0.6% and includes a 4.9% increase in average Guest check offset in part by a 4.3% decrease in Guest count. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 7.5% increase in menu prices, partially offset by a 1.1% decrease from menu mix and a 1.4% decrease from additional discounts. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by greater incidence of promotional menu items offered at reduced prices.

Restaurant revenue decreased $29.7 million or 3.0% in the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. Restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a 2.1% decrease in comparable restaurant revenue inclusive of a benefit from the change in the Company's loyalty program. Comparable restaurant revenue reflects a 6.5% decrease in Guest count, partially offset by a 4.4% increase in average Guest check. The decrease in Guest count is due in part to overlapping elevated performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, our exit of virtual brands in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and adverse weather impacts during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 6.7% increase in menu prices, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease from menu mix and a 0.8% decrease from discounts. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by Guests shifting visits from third party delivery platforms with elevated menu prices, to dine in visits at standard menu prices, and reduced incidence of add on menu items. Dine-in sales comprised 76.5% of total food and beverage sales during the year to date period of 2024, as compared to 74.8% in the same period in 2023.

Average weekly net sales volumes are calculated as the total restaurant revenue for all Company-owned Red Robin restaurants for each time period presented, divided by the number of operating weeks in the period.

Pre-opening costs, which are expensed as incurred, comprise the costs related to preparing restaurants to introduce Donatos and other initiatives, as well as direct costs, including labor, occupancy, training, and marketing, incurred related to opening new restaurants and hiring the initial work force. Our pre-opening costs fluctuate from period to period, depending upon, but not limited to, the number of restaurants where Donatos has been introduced, the number of restaurant openings, the size of the restaurants being opened, and the location of the restaurants. Pre-opening costs for any period will typically include expenses associated with restaurants opened during the period as well as expenses related to restaurants opening in subsequent periods. ® ®

We did not open any new restaurants or roll out any Donatos locations in the year to date period of fiscal 2024. We opened one restaurant and completed the rollout of 25 Donatos locations in the year to date period of fiscal 2023. ® ®

## Interest Expense

Interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was $6.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The $0.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate to 14.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 13.4% in the prior year quarter. Average outstanding debt was $191.6 million and $194.5 million as of October 6, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

Interest expense was $18.9 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 and $20.4 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2023. The $1.4 million decrease was primarily due to the net paydown of debt with the proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate to 13.3% for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 12.6% in the same period last year. Average outstanding debt was $185.2 million and $205.9 million as of October 6, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

## Income Tax Provision

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was a 0.5% benefit, compared to a 3.5% expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 was 0.1%, compared to 6.4% for the year to date period of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024 reflects the valuation allowance recorded against the Company's net tax assets in addition to certain state income taxes due to attribute limitations, minimum state income taxes, and state franchise taxes. The higher effective tax rate for the fiscal 2023 periods as compared to the fiscal 2024 periods is due to the near break-even pretax book income generated in fiscal 2023.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures give the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company and are intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted exclude the impact of non-operating or nonrecurring items including changes in estimates, asset impairments, litigation contingencies, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, restaurant and office closure costs, gains on sale leaseback transactions, severance and executive transition costs and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items net of income tax impacts. Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently, and as a result our measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss) as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance.

The Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise revenue and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, and pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because these costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $1.3 million to $30.3 million as of October 6, 2024, from $31.6 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. As of October 6, 2024, the Company had approximately $42.0 million in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and $20.0 million available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility.

## Cash Flows

The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each period presented (in thousands):

| Net cash provided by operating activities                    | $ 1,840             | $ 17,361            |
| Net cash provided by investing activities                    | 4,873               | 18,992              |
| Net cash used in financing activities                        | (7,990)             | (33,741)            |
| Net change in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash | $ (1,277)           | $ 2,612             |

## Operating Cash Flows

Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $15.5 million to $1.8 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to $17.4 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the decrease in restaurant level profitability.

## Investing Cash Flows

Net cash flows provided by investing activities decreased to $4.9 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $19.0 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. The $14.1 million decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower proceeds from sale lease-back transactions in the current year period, partially offset by a reduction in current year capital expenditures. In addition, cash provided by investing activities in the prior year included a $3.5 million cash outflow for the acquisition of five franchised restaurants.

The following table lists the components of our capital expenditures for the periods presented (in thousands):

|                                          | Forty Weeks Ended   | Forty Weeks Ended   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| New restaurants and restaurant refreshes | -                   | 1,421               |
| Total capital expenditures               | $ 19,414            | $ 37,074            |

## Financing Cash Flows

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased to $8.0 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to $33.7 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 primarily relate to the paydown of $21.2 million of debt with proceeds from the saleleaseback transaction and debt issuance costs associated with an amendment to the credit facility, partially offset by $20 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 primarily relate to the net paydown of debt of $24.6 million and $10.0 million in share repurchases.

## Credit Facility

On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), which provides for a Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate, which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum.

On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment among other things: provides certain relief from the financial covenant by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by $15.0 million to $40.0 million through the end of the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50% per annum and that are ABR-based loans to 6.50% per annum; and adds certain additional reporting requirements.

On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment") which extends the provisions of the Second Amendment through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026.

As of October 6, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $180.7 million, net of $7.2 million of unamortized deferred financing charges and discounts, none of which was classified as current. As of October 6, 2024, the Company had $20.0 million of available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility and $8.1 million of letters of credit issued against cash collateral. The Company's cash collateral is reported in Restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Covenants

We are subject to a number of customary covenants under our Credit Facility, including limitations on additional borrowings, acquisitions, stock repurchases, sales of assets, and dividend payments, as well as a net total leverage ratio covenant, as defined, that adjusts periodically as specified in the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement. As of October 6, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

Additionally, as noted under " Credit Facility " above, the Third Amendment extended the increase in the required maximum net total leverage ratio covenant from the third quarter of 2025 through the end of the first quarter of 2026.

## Working Capital

We typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a working capital deficit because restaurant sales are primarily conducted on a cash or credit card basis. Rapid turnover of inventory results in limited investment in inventories, and cash from sales is usually received before related payables for food, supplies, and payroll become due. In addition, receipts from the sale of gift cards are received well in advance of related redemptions. Rather than maintain higher cash balances that would result from this pattern of operating cash flows, we typically utilize operating cash flows in excess of those required for currently maturing liabilities to pay for capital expenditures, debt repayment, or to repurchase stock. When necessary, we utilize our Credit Facility to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. We believe our future cash flows generated from restaurant operations combined with our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, and cash on hand, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next 12 months.

## Share Repurchase

On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company's current share repurchase program of up to a total of $75.0 million of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization will terminate upon completing repurchases of $75.0 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Pursuant to the repurchase program, purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock. From the date of the current program approval through October 6, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 1,088,588 shares at an average price of $15.18 per share for an aggregate amount of $16,520,000. The Company completed no share repurchases during the quarter and year to date periods ended October 6, 2024. Accordingly, as of October 6, 2024, we had $58.5 million of availability under the current share repurchase program. Our Credit Agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares to certain conditions set forth by the lenders in the Credit Facility.

## Table of Contents

## Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Sales in most of our restaurants were historically higher during the spring months and winter holiday season due to factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality, and seasonality of sales may shift over time. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.

## Contractual Obligations

There were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations since the filing of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies .

## Critical Accounting Estimates

Critical accounting estimates are those we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, including our estimates of future restaurant level cash flows, which are subject to the current economic environment and potentially unknown future events, and we might obtain different results if we use different assumptions or conditions. We had no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates which were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.

## ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There has been no material change in the interest rate risk or commodity price risk since the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

We continue to monitor our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis and may use interest rate swaps or similar instruments in the future to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings as the Company deems appropriate. As of October 6, 2024, we had $187.9 million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates. A 1.0% change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre-tax interest expense fluctuation of $1.9 million on an annualized basis.

We purchase food, supplies and other commodities for use in our operations based on prices established with our suppliers. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to commodity price increases. A 1.0% increase in food and beverage costs would negatively impact cost of sales by approximately $2.9 million on an annualized basis.

## ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company ("Management"), including the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, based upon the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings

Evaluating contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving subjective judgment on the potential outcome of future events and the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current analysis. Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures each quarter in consultation with legal counsel and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

For further information related to our litigation contingencies, see Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into an incremental amendment to its Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment"), by and among the Company, Red Robin International, Inc., as the borrower (the "Borrower"), certain subsidiary guarantors party thereto, certain lenders party thereto (constituting the Required Lenders and each Revolving Facility Lender holding a Second Amendment Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment) and Fortress Credit Corp., as administrative agent and as collateral agent (the "Agent"), which amends the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 4, 2022 (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1, dated as of July 17, 2023, and that certain Amendment No. 2, dated as of August 21, 2024, the "Credit Agreement", and by the Third Amendment, the "Amended Credit Agreement"), by and among the Company, the Borrower, the lenders and issuing banks from time to time party thereto, the Agent and the other parties from time to time party thereto. All capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Amended Credit Agreement.

The Third Amendment provides additional flexibility to continue to implement our business strategy, making the following changes to the Credit Agreement:

- · Maintaining the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement at $40 million through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026. The revolving commitments were previously scheduled to be reduced to $25 million at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2025.
- · Providing additional relief from the financial covenant by increasing the permitted Maximum Net Total Leverage Ratio beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025 through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026.

The summary descriptions of the Third Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
