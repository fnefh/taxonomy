All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.

The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Red Robin have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date but does not include all disclosures required for audited annual financial statements. For further information, please refer to and read these interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2023.

## Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements

As previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the period ended July 9, 2023, the Company discovered a multi-year error in its calculation and recognition of revenue related to gift cards, primarily related to breakage revenue that had been recognized for bonus and discounted gift cards for which no or discounted monetary consideration was received, which resulted in the Company overstating total revenues by $0.1 million and $0.6 million for the twelve and forty weeks ended October 2, 2022. Management has evaluated this misstatement and concluded it was not material to prior periods, individually or in the aggregate. However, correcting the cumulative effect of the error in the twelve and forty weeks ended October 2, 2022 would have had a significant effect on the results of operations for such periods. Therefore, the Company is correcting the relevant prior period Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes for this error for comparative purposes.

The following tables reflect the effects of the correction on all affected line items of the Company's previously reported Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Form 10-Q:

## 4. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated based upon the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if holders of options exercised their options into common stock. As the Company was in a net loss position for both the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, all potentially dilutive common shares are considered anti-dilutive.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding stock options and awards.Basic weighted average shares outstanding is reconciled to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows (in thousands):

During the second quarter of 2022 the Company closed on an agreement to sell a restaurant property that the Company owned and leased back on a short-term basis. The Company collected initial net proceeds from the purchaser-lessor of $3.9 million, which represented a portion of the total consideration received from the sale. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company received the remaining proceeds, upon which the lease terminated and the sale transaction was completed, and recognized a $9.2 million gain on the sale of the restaurant property. The initial net proceeds of $3.9 million are included within cash flows from financing activities and the final proceeds received of $8.5 million are included within cash flows from investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022.

Litigation contingencies during the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 represent reserves for various in progress legal matters.

## Credit Agreement

On March 4, 2022, the Company replaced its prior amended and restated credit agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") with a new Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, Red Robin International, Inc., as the borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto, the issuing banks from time to time party thereto, Fortress Credit Corp., as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner. The five-year $225.0 million Credit Agreement provides for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit and a $200.0 million term loan (collectively, the "Credit Facility"). The borrower maintains the option to increase the amount of borrowings available under the Credit Agreement in the future, subject to lenders' participation, by up to an additional $40.0 million in the aggregate on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Facility will mature on March 4, 2027. No amortization is required with respect to the revolving Credit Facility. The term loans require quarterly principal payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the term loan. The Credit Facility's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate ("ABR"), which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus1.0% per annum.

Red Robin International, Inc. is the borrower under the Credit Agreement, and certain of its subsidiaries and the Company are guarantors of borrower's obligations under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors, including the Company, and are available to: (i) refinance certain existing indebtedness of the borrower and its subsidiaries, (ii) pay any fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, and (iii) provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of the Company, the borrower and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures, but excluding restricted payments.

On March 4, 2022, Red Robin International, Inc., the Company, and the guarantors also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement") granting to the Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement. This new Security Agreement replaced the existing security agreement, dated January 10, 2020, which was entered into in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement.

Red Robin International, Inc. as the borrower is obligated to pay customary fees to the agents, lenders and issuing banks under the Credit Agreement with respect to providing, maintaining, or administering, as applicable, the credit facilities.

In connection with entry into the new Credit Agreement, the Company's Prior Credit Agreement was terminated. In connection with such termination and new borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, the Company paid off all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest, and fees under the Prior Credit Agreement.

On July 17, 2023, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement Amendment") to remove the previously included $50.0 million aggregate cap (the "Prior Cap") on sale-leasebacks of Company-owned real property. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, it also was agreed that (i) the Company may reinvest in the business within 360 days of receipt the net proceeds of sale-leasebacks to the extent that such proceeds are equal to or less than the amount of the Prior Cap and (ii) the Company shall make a mandatory prepayment with the net proceeds of sale-leasebacks to the extent that such proceeds exceed the amount of the Prior Cap. Additionally, the prepayment premium associated with any mandatory prepayments derived from the net proceeds of sale-leasebacks that exceed the Prior Cap is reduced by the Credit Agreement Amendment to a premium equal to 50% of the prepayment premium otherwise applicable. The Amendment also made certain other conforming changes to the Existing Credit Agreement to effect the foregoing.

The summary descriptions of the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Amendment, and the Security Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement Amendment, and the Security Agreement, respectively, which have been filed as exhibits to the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2022, with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement, and July 19, 2023, with respect to the Credit Agreement Amendment.

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing charges related to the extinguishment of the Prior Credit Agreement on March 4, 2022. These charges were recorded to interest expense, net and other on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022. In association with the execution of the new Credit Agreement, the Company recognized $4.8 million of deferred financing charges, and $6.1 million of original issuance discount.

## 7. Fair Value Measurements

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments.

The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund obligations under a deferred compensation plan. Amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value and are included in Other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Fair market value of mutual funds is measured using level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets).

The following tables present the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in Other assets, net on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 1, 2023 and December 25, 2022 (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| Total assets measured at fair value | $ 4,250           | $                 | $ -       | $ -       |

Other than as disclosed in Note 9. Acquisition of Franchised Restaurants, as of October 1, 2023, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities that were measured using level 2 or 3 inputs. The Company also had no non-financial assets or liabilities that were required to be measured on a recurring basis.

## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, right of use assets, and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired.

The Company has measured non-financial assets for impairment using continuing and projected future cash flows, which were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level 3 fair value measurement. See Note 5. Other Charges (Gains), net.

We impaired long-lived restaurant assets with a carrying value (including right of use lease assets) of $15.3 million and $26.7 million during the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, recognizing impairment expense of $4.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively, related to the net book value of these long-lived restaurant assets. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be $10.5 million and $20.2 million in the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023. Additionally, we impaired long-lived assets at the Company's closed corporate office with a carrying value (including right of use lease assets) of $1.0 million, recognizing an impairment expense of $0.7 million during the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, related to the net book value of these long-lived restaurant assets. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be $0.3 million in the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023. The impairments were recorded as a result of quantitative impairment analyses.

## Disclosures of Fair Value of Other Assets and Liabilities

The Company's liability under its credit facility is carried at historical cost in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 1, 2023, the fair value of the credit facility was approximately $188.0 million and the principal amount carrying value was $189.1 million. The credit facility term loan is reported net of $7.0 million in unamortized discount and debt issuance costs in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 1, 2023. The carrying value of the credit facility was $214.0 million and the fair value of the credit facility was $205.1 million as of December 25, 2022. The interest rate on the credit facility represents a level 2 fair value input.

## 8. Commitments and Contingencies

Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving highly subjective judgment about potential outcomes of future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the claim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures each quarter in consultation with legal counsel, and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current estimates.

In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, and other contingencies, certain of which are covered by insurance policies. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these suits, legal proceedings, and claims with certainty, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for potential losses associated with these matters has been made in the financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of any one of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. A significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

As of October 1, 2023, we had a balance of $13.7 million for loss contingencies included within Accrued liabilities and other on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, administrative proceedings, and other contingencies. These include employment related claims and class action lawsuits, claims from Guests or Team Members alleging illness, injury, food quality, health, or operational concerns, and lease and other commercial disputes. We increased our estimate of loss contingency liabilities by approximately $3.6 million for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 and $9.1 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 related to changes during the third quarter in the status of ongoing litigation matters. We ultimately may be subject to greater or less than the accrued amount for this and other matters.

As of October 1, 2023, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments to certain vendors who provide food and beverages and other supplies to our restaurants, for an aggregate of $216.6 million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such, no liability has been recorded.

## 9. Acquisition of Franchised Restaurants

On April 17, 2023, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities offive restaurants from one of its U.S. franchisees for cash consideration of $3.5 million. The pro forma impact of this acquisition and the operating results of the acquired restaurants are not presented as the impact was not material to reported results.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method as defined in ASC 805, Business Combinations . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the benefit of the assembled workforce of the acquired restaurants. The goodwill generated by the acquisition is not amortizable for book purposes but is amortizable and deductible for tax purposes. The Company allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows (in thousands):

Table of Contents

|                                      | Fair Value at Acquisition Date   |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Property and equipment, net          | 2,637                            |
| Operating lease assets               | 7,400                            |
| Operating lease liabilities          | (8,250)                          |
| Operating lease assets, net          | (850)                            |
| Other assets, net of liabilities (1) | 299                              |
| Intangible assets, net               | 1,443                            |
| Total purchase price                 | 3,529                            |

Of the $2.6 million in property and equipment, $1.7 million is related to leasehold improvements and $1.0 million is related to personal property. The $0.9 million in net operating lease assets is related to acquired unfavorable leases, which reduces the acquired operating lease right-of-use assets. Of the $1.4 million of intangible assets, $1.2 million is related to reacquired franchise rights, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis. The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a level 3 fair value measurement.

We believe the non-GAAP measure of adjusted loss per share-diluted gives the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and it is intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted loss per share-diluted excludes the effects of change in estimate, gift card breakage, asset impairment, litigation contingencies, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, restaurant closure costs, other financing costs, gain on sale leaseback, net of expenses, closed corporate office costs, net of sublease income, COVID-19 related charges, severance and executive transition costs, and income tax effects and other. We have revised our definition of adjusted loss per diluted share to exclude gain on sale leaseback, net of expenses and other. We did not revise the prior year's adjusted loss per share-diluted because there were no other charges similar in nature to these costs. Other companies may define adjusted net loss per share-diluted differently, and as a result our measure of adjusted loss per share-diluted may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Adjusted loss per share-diluted should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net loss as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance.

We believe the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA give the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company, and it is intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of change in accounting estimate - gift card breakage, asset impairment, litigation contingencies, restaurant closure costs, net, other financing costs, COVID-19 related charges, severance and executive transition costs, closed corporate office, net of sublease income, and gain of sale leaseback, net of expenses, and other. We have revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude gain of sale leaseback, net of expenses and other. We did not revise prior years' adjusted EBITDA because there were no other charges similar in nature to these costs. Other companies may define EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, and as a result our measure of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net loss as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance.

The Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise royalties, fees and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes selling costs and general and administrative expenses, and therefore excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, and pre-opening costs. The Company excludes Other charges (gains), net because these costs are not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations or net income (loss) as indicators of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry.

Restaurant revenue for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023, which comprises primarily food and beverage sales, decreased $9.3 million, or 3.3%, as compared to the third quarter of 2022. Restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a 3.4% decrease in comparable restaurant revenue. The comparable restaurant revenue decrease was driven by a 10.4% decrease in Guest count, partially offset by a 7.0% increase in average Guest check. The decrease in Guest count is due in part, to the Company's decision not to repeat the deep discount "$10 Meal Deal" promotion that was offered in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and the decision to discontinue offering virtual brands. These decisions are expected to reduce complexity and support execution of an enhanced Red Robin guest experience, that results in increased guest counts and profitability in time. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 7.7% increase in menu prices and a 2.1% decrease in discounts, partially offset by a 2.8% decrease from menu mix. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by Guests shifting visits from third party delivery platforms with elevated menu prices, to dine in visits at standard menu prices, and the removal of low Guest preference, but higher priced burger options. Dine-in sales comprised 75.6% of total food and beverage sales during the third quarter of 2023, as compared to 72.4% in the same period in 2022.

Restaurant revenue for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, increased $21.7 million, or 2.3%, as compared to the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022. The increase was due to a $26.4 million, or 2.9%, increase in comparable restaurant revenue, partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease at non-comparable restaurants, including the impact of restaurant closures. The comparable restaurant revenue increase was driven by a 7.5% increase in average Guest check, partially offset by a 4.6% decrease in Guest count. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 7.9% increase in menu pricing and a 0.9% decrease in discounts, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in menu mix. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by Guests shifting visits from third party delivery platforms with elevated menu prices, to dine in visits at standard menu prices, and the removal of low Guest preference, but higher priced burger options. Dine-in sales comprised 74.8% of total food and beverage sales during the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, as compared to 70.9% in the same period in 2022.

Average weekly net sales volumes represent the total restaurant revenue for all Company-owned Red Robin restaurants for each time period presented, divided by the number of operating weeks in the period. Comparable restaurant revenues include those restaurants that have operated five full quarters as of the end of the period presented. Fluctuations in average weekly net sales volumes for Company-owned restaurants reflect the effect of comparable restaurant revenue changes as well as the performance of reopened and new restaurants during the period.

Franchise and other revenue increased by less than $0.1 million, or 0.8%, for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the twelve weeks ended October 2, 2022, and decreased $3.6 million, or 14.8% for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Franchise revenue declined primarily due to a reduction in the percentage of sales each franchisee is required to contribute to support Selling activities. This reduction results from an increased focus on local restaurant marketing and reduced national and/or mass media channels pursuant to our North Star strategy. The percentage of sales each franchisee is required to contribute could change in the future, as we expect to align contributions with spending levels, subject to compliance with the respective franchise agreement. Franchise restaurants reported a decrease of 2.3% comparable restaurant revenue for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, and an increase of 2.3% for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Other revenue increased $0.9 million for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the twelve weeks ended October 2, 2022 primarily due to higher gift card breakage and the reclassification of the year-to-date closed corporate office sublease income to other charges (gains) during the twelve weeks ended October 2, 2022. Other revenue decreased $0.9 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the change in estimate over gift card breakage in 2022.

Cost of sales, which comprises food and beverage costs, is variable and generally fluctuates with sales volume. Cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 120 and 30 basis points for the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The decreases were primarily driven by menu price increases and implementation of various cost savings initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation.

Labor costs include restaurant level hourly wages and management salaries as well as related taxes and benefits. For the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 240 and 110 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by investments in hourly and management labor, payroll taxes, and incentive compensation, partially offset by group insurance. In 2023, we made investments in management and hourly labor to support an enhanced Guest experience, with an objective to drive increases in guest traffic count over time, resulting in an increase in restaurant profitability.

For the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023, other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 30 basis points as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced third party commission expenses associated with lower off premise mix and lower commission rates, lower supplies costs driven by negotiated savings, and lower contract janitorial expenses, partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance costs.

For the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 30 basis points compared to the same period in 2022.

Occupancy costs include fixed rents, property taxes, common area maintenance charges, general liability insurance, contingent rents, and other property costs. Occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 50 basis points for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase is due to the impact of an increase in fixed rents, deleveraging from reduced restaurant revenue, and the sale-leaseback of 18 restaurant properties in 2023.

Our fixed rents for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 were $16.6 million and $16.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million, primarily due to increased expenses related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, partially offset by net Company-owned restaurant closures.

For the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the sale-leaseback of 18 restaurant properties in 2023.

Our fixed rents for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 were $53.6 million and $53.5 million, an increase of $0.1 million, due to increased expenses related to the sale-leaseback of 18 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee, mostly offset by reduced expenses related to net Company-owned restaurant closures.

Components of this category include marketing and advertising costs; restaurant support center, regional, and franchise support salaries and benefits; travel; professional and consulting fees; corporate information systems; legal expenses; office rent; training; and board of directors' expenses.

General and administrative costs in the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 decreased $2.3 million, or 10.7%, as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in salaries and stock compensation due to a reduction in force and executive transition, and decreased travel due to holding a 2022 leadership conference and no leadership conference in 2023, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and lower capitalized wages due to fewer eligible capital projects.

General and administrative costs in the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 increased $2.0 million, or 3.1%, as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, increased travel, and lower capitalized costs due to fewer eligible capital projects, partially offset by a decrease in wages and stock compensation due to the reduction in force and executive transition.

Selling costs in the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 decreased $5.4 million, or 38.2%, and $14.8 million, or 39.5%, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased marketing spend in internet and local media.

Pre-opening costs, which are expensed as incurred, comprise the costs related to preparing restaurants to introduce Donatos and other initiatives, as well as direct costs, including labor, occupancy, training, and marketing, incurred related to opening new restaurants and hiring the initial work force. Our pre-opening costs fluctuate from period to period, depending upon, but not limited to, the number of restaurants where Donatos has been introduced, the number of restaurant openings, the size of the restaurants being opened, and the location of the restaurants. Pre-opening costs for any given quarter will typically include expenses associated with restaurants opened during the quarter as well as expenses related to restaurants opening in subsequent quarters. ® ®

For the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023, pre-opening costs decreased by $0.2 million due to no new restaurant openings or rollouts of Donatos . Pre-opening costs increased by $0.1 million during the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 related to one additional new restaurant opening in Glendale, AZ partially offset by the rollout of 25 less Donatos locations. ® ®

## Interest Expense, Net and Other

Interest expense, net and other was $5.9 million for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 and $4.6 million for the twelve weeks ended October 2, 2022. Interest expense for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 was $6.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively. The $1.6 million increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 was 13.4% and 9.7%, respectively. Lower average outstanding debt, which decreased $5.0 million compared to the same period in 2022, also contributed.

Interest expense, net and other was $19.5 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and $16.2 million for the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022, an increase of $3.4 million, or 21.0%. Interest expense for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 was $20.4 million and $15.8 million, respectively. The $4.5 million increase was primarily related to a higher weighted average interest rate, higher average outstanding debt, which increased $5.0 million compared to the same period in 2022, and the write off of approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing charges related to the Company's Prior Credit Facility upon the execution of the Credit Agreement (as defined below) on March 4, 2022. Our weighted average interest rate on our credit facility debt was 12.6% for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 as compared to 8.7% for the same period in 2022.

Interest income and other decreased by $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the twelve and forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, respectively. The decreases were due to investment changes related to a deferred compensation plan for which assets are held in a rabbi trust, along with lower interest income on bank account balances in the forty-week period.

## Income Tax Provision

The effective tax rate for the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023 was a 3.5% benefit, compared to a 0.3% benefit for the twelve weeks ended October 2, 2022. The effective tax rate for both periods include changes in the valuation allowance as a result of originating temporary differences during the year and varies from statutory rates primarily as a result of the valuation allowance as discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022.

The effective tax rate for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 was a 6.4% expense, compared to a 1.3% expense for the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022. The effective tax rate for both periods include changes in the valuation allowance as a result of originating temporary differences during the year and varies from statutory rates primarily as a result of the valuation allowance as discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $2.6 million to $60.8 million as of October 1, 2023, from $58.2 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is using available cash flow from operations to maintain existing restaurants and infrastructure, and execute on its long-term strategic initiatives. As of October 1, 2023, the Company had approximately $73.6 million in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility (as defined below).

## Cash Flows

The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each period presented (in thousands):

| Net change in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash | $ 2,612             | $ 35,380            |

## Operating Cash Flows

Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $21.4 million to $17.4 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the receipt of an income tax refund of $14.7 million in 2022, and severance payments and higher interest payments in 2023.

## Investing Cash Flows

Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $19.0 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, as compared to net cash flows used of $18.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds from sales of real estate, partially offset by increased investment in restaurant improvements and the acquisition of five franchised restaurants.

The following table lists the components of our capital expenditures, net of currency translation, for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 (in thousands):

## Financing Cash Flows

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $33.7 million for the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023, as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $14.9 million in the same period in 2022.

In 2022, financing activities were a source of cash, due to net draws made on long-term debt as a result of the Company's refinancing of debt on March 4, 2022. In 2023, the use of cash results primarily from the Company's repayment of outstanding debt with proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction, $10.0 million of share repurchases, and standard principal payments due under the terms of the Company's Credit Agreement.

## Credit Facility

On March 4, 2022, the Company replaced its prior amended and restated Credit Agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") with a new Credit Agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the "Credit Agreement"), which provides for a new Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate ("ABR"), which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum.

As of October 1, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $182.1 million net of $7.0 million of unamortized deferred financing charges and discounts, of which $0.9 million was classified as current. As of October 1, 2023, the Company had $25.0 million of available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility.

As of October 1, 2023, the Company had $11.7 million of letters of credit issued against cash collateral, compared to $7.8 million as of the prior comparable period. The Company's cash collateral is recorded in Restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the quarter ended October 1, 2023.

## Covenants

We are subject to a number of customary covenants under our Credit Facility, including limitations on additional borrowings, acquisitions, stock repurchases, sales of assets, and dividend payments, as well as a Total Net Leverage ratio covenant. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

## Debt Outstanding

Total debt outstanding decreased $24.9 million to $190.0 million at October 1, 2023, from $214.9 million at December 25, 2022, primarily driven by payments of long-term debt during the forty weeks ended October 1, 2023.

## Table of Contents

## Working Capital

We typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a working capital deficit because restaurant sales are primarily conducted on a cash or credit card basis. Rapid turnover of inventory results in limited investment in inventories, and cash from sales is usually received before related payables for food, supplies, and payroll become due. In addition, receipts from the sale of gift cards are received well in advance of related redemptions. Rather than maintain higher cash balances that would result from this pattern of operating cash flows, we typically utilize operating cash flows in excess of those required for currently maturing liabilities to pay for capital expenditures, debt repayment, or to repurchase stock as allowed. When necessary, we utilize our credit facility to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. We believe our future cash flows generated from restaurant operations combined with our remaining borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy any working capital deficits and our planned capital expenditures.

## Share Repurchase

On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company's current share repurchase program of up to a total of $75.0 million of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization was effective as of August 9, 2018, and will terminate upon completing repurchases of $75.0 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Pursuant to the repurchase program, purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock.

Effective March 14, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program to provide additional liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2023, the Company resumed its repurchase program.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we repurchased 480,071 shares at an average price of $10.33 per share, for an aggregate amount of $5.0 million.

Under the current authorization through October 1, 2023, we have repurchased a total of 1,088,588 shares at an average price of $15.18 per share for an aggregate amount of $16.5 million. As of October 1, 2023, we had $58.5 million of availability under the current share repurchase program. Our Credit Agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares to certain conditions set forth by the lenders in the Credit Facility.

## Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants were greater during the summer months and winter holiday season and lesser during the fall season. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter.

## Contractual Obligations

There were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations since the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022. Our current purchase obligations for system-wide fixed price commitments for food, beverage, equipment, and restaurant supply items are $223.7 million as of October 1, 2023 of which $43.3 million are due in 2023.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, including our estimates of future restaurant level cash flows, which are subject to the current economic environment and potentially unknown future events, and we might obtain different results if we use different assumptions or conditions. We had no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates which were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022.

## ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There has been no material change in the interest rate risk or commodity price risk since the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022.

We continue to monitor our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis and may use interest rate swaps or similar instruments in the future to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings as the Company deems appropriate. As of October 1, 2023, we had $189.1 million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates. A 1.0% change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre-tax interest expense fluctuation of $1.9 million on an annualized basis.

The Company's restaurant menus are highly dependent upon a few select commodities, including ground beef, poultry, and potatoes. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to commodity price increases. A 1.0% increase in food and beverage costs would negatively impact cost of sales by approximately $3.1 million on an annualized basis.

## ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company ("Management"), including the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, based upon the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d15(e) under the Exchange Act), the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings

Evaluating contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving subjective judgment on the potential outcome of future events and the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current analysis. Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures each quarter in consultation with legal counsel and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the consolidated financial statements.

For further information related to our litigation contingencies, see Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Risk factors associated with our business are contained in Item 1, "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2023. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the fiscal year 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

During the twelve weeks ended October 1, 2023, the Company did not have any sales of securities in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that have not been reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K or that are reported in this Item. On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company's current share repurchase program of up to a total of $75 million of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization became effective on August 9, 2018 and will terminate upon completing repurchases of $75 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions and may include transactions pursuant to a repurchase plan administered in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion and the timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the Company may suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time. The table below provides a summary of the Company's purchases of its own common stock during the third quarter of 2023. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended share repurchases effective March 14, 2020. In May 2023, the Company resumed share repurchases.
