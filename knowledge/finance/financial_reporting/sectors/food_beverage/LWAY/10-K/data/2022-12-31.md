incorporated by reference herein, and other documents we file with the SEC, contain forward looking statements. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make
forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business
through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results
to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements. These statements use words, variations of words, and negatives of words such as "may,"
"could," "believe," "future," "depend," "expect," "will," "result," "can," "remain," "assurance," "subject to," "require," "limit," "impose," "guarantee," "restrict,"
"continue," "become," "predict," "likely," "opportunities," "effect," "change," "future," "predict," and "estimate." Examples of forward looking statements include, but

predictions of actions by customers, suppliers, competitors or regulatory authorities, (iii) statements of future economic performance, and (iv) statements of assumptions
underlying other statements and statements about Lifeway or its business.

These forward looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, estimates and observations of future events based on information available to our
management at the time the statements are made and include any statements that do not relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from
what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements due in part to the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that include:

    outbreak; and

*   the other risks and uncertainties that are set forth in Item 1, "Business", Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and that are described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.

These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking
statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. We intend these forward looking statements to speak only
at the date made. Except as otherwise required to be disclosed in periodic reports required to be filed by public companies with the SEC pursuant to the SEC's rules, we
have no duty to update these statements, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Lifeway was founded in 1986 by Michael Smolyansky shortly after he and his wife, Ludmila Smolyansky, emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States. Lifeway
was the first to successfully introduce kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area.
In the thirty-six years that have followed, Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader
market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, "better for you" foods.
PRODUCTS
Our primary product is drinkable kefir, a cultured dairy product. Lifeway Kefir is tart and tangy, high in protein, calcium and vitamin D. Thanks to our exclusive blend
of kefir cultures, each cup of kefir contains 12 live and active cultures and 25 to 30 billion beneficial CFU (Colony Forming Units) at the time of manufacture.
We manufacture (directly or through co-packers) and market products under the Lifeway, Fresh Made and Glen Oaks Farms brand names, as well as under private
labels on behalf of certain customers.
Our product categories are:
*   Drinkable Kefir, sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types;
*   European-style soft cheeses, including farmer cheese, white cheese, and Sweet Kiss;
*   Cream and other, which consists primarily of cream, a byproduct of making our kefir;
*   ProBugs, a line of kefir products designed for children;
*   Drinkable Yogurt, sold in a variety of sizes and flavors; and
*   Other Dairy, which consists primarily of Fresh Made butter and sour cream.

Net sales of products by category were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Product innovation and new product development
Lifeway is committed to maintaining its positions as the leading producer of kefir and a recognized leader in the market for probiotic products. We routinely evaluate
opportunities for new product flavors and formulations, improved package design, new product configurations and other innovation avenues. Beyond our core drinkable
kefir products, we have an ongoing effort to extend the strength of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into fresh categories and
into additional channels of trade, such as Convenience; Foodservice; Club; and Drug. In 2022, we maintained the level of focus on product innovations, packaging
innovations, and growth opportunities. These product innovation and development efforts have led to additional revenue opportunities.

Lifeway considers research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall business philosophy. Where possible, we leverage our existing staff
and facilities to conduct our innovation, research, and development efforts, rather than maintaining a dedicated research and development staff and facilities or relying
solely on third parties. Until the second half of 2021, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, our focus was on expanding sales of our current products, and less on new
product development. In August 2021, we purchased the Glen Oaks Farms drinkable yogurt product line, and launched our drinkable oat-based kefir product line in
December 2021.

PRODUCTION
Manufacturing
During 2022 and 2021, approximately 96% and 98% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from products manufactured at our own facilities. We currently operate
the following manufacturing and distribution facilities:

*   Morton Grove, Illinois, which produces drinkable kefir, drinkable ProBugs kefir, and cheese products;
*   Waukesha, Wisconsin, which produces drinkable kefir products and from which we store and distribute products;
*   Niles, Illinois, which stores and serves as a distribution point for products; and
*   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which produces drinkable kefir, cheese, and butter products, from which we store and distribute products.

We own these manufacturing facilities. All our fixed assets associated with manufacturing, storage, and distribution of our products are in the United States.

Co-Packers
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent manufacturers ("co-packers") manufacture some of our products. We have a co-packer
agreement to manufacture drinkable yogurt in California. We have a co-packer agreement to manufacture drinkable kefir in Ireland, to serve our European markets.
During 2022 and 2021, approximately 4% and 2% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from products manufactured by co-packers. Our domestic co-packer is Safe
Quality Food ("SQF") certified and follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in
accordance with our quality specifications and that they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.
2
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Sales Organization
We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, brokers, and distributors. Our sales organization strives to cultivate strong, collaborative relationships with
our customers that facilitate favorable shelf placement for our products, which we believe will drive sales volumes when combined with our marketing efforts and our
brand strength. Our relationships with food brokers provide additional customer coverage as a supplement to our direct sales force.
Distribution inside the United States
Lifeway's products reach the consumer through three primary "route-to-market" pathways:
Retail-direct;
Distributor; and
Direct store delivery ("DSD").
Under the retail-direct channel, we sell our products to retailers and deliver it through either the retailers' carriers or third-party carriers that deliver to such retailers'
distribution centers. In turn, our retailers then deliver the products to their respective stores. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include Kroger, Walmart and
Trader Joe's. Under the retail direct-model, optimal product merchandising, assortment and product presentation are attended to by the retailer. Sales to our retail-direct
customers represent approximately 50% of our total net sales for the year ended 2022.
Under the distributor channel, we sell our products to distributors and deliver it through either the distributors' carriers or third-party carriers that deliver to such
distributors' designated warehouses. In turn, our distributors then sell and ship our products to their retail customers. Our distributors often use a DSD model of their
own to make deliveries directly to individual stores, but they also make deliveries to retailers' distribution centers. Our distributor customers include United Natural
Foods (UNFI), KeHE Distributors, and C&S Wholesale Grocers. The distributor attends to optimal product merchandising, assortment, and product presentations at the
retail end of the channel, with support from Lifeway's direct sales force and broker network. Sales to our distributor customers represented approximately 48% of our
total net sales for year ended 2022.
Under the direct store delivery (DSD) route to market, we sell our products to retailers and deliver it directly to the store using Company-owned vehicles and a team of
Lifeway merchandisers who engage face-to-face with store management to ensure optimal product assortments and presentations. We operate our DSD model in the
Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area only. Sales to our DSD customers represent approximately 2% of our total net sales for the year ended 2022.
Distribution outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of Lifeway's products are distributed within the United States; however, certain of our distributors sell our products to retailers in Mexico and portions
of South America and the Caribbean. Additionally, Lifeway products reach consumers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Middle East under third party co-
manufacturing agreements and in-country broker and distributor arrangements. Sales outside the United States represented approximately 1% of net sales for the year
ended 2022.
3
Channel- and Market-Specific Distribution and Broker Representation Arrangements
Lifeway's generally standardized agreements with independent distributors and food brokers allow us the latitude to establish new relationships as opportunities and
needs arise. Where appropriate given the relationship, market, and business opportunity, we offer exclusive channels, markets, and/or territories to our distributors and
brokers.
We provide our independent distributors with products at wholesale prices for distribution to their retail accounts. Lifeway believes that the prices at which we sell our
products to distributors are competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets served. Due to the perishable nature of our
products and the costs to return, we do not offer return privileges to any of our distributors or channel customers; however, from time to time we do provide our
customers with allowances for non-saleable product.
Lifeway engages independent food brokers generally on a commission basis, subject in some cases to a minimum commission guarantee. The commissions vary based
on the scope of services provided and customers served. Our brokers represent our products to a variety of prospective buyers. These buyers could be specialty stores,
retail grocery chains, wholesalers, foodservice operators and distributors, drug chains, mass merchandisers, industrial users, schools and universities, or military
installations. With support from our direct sales force, brokers may provide other value-added services. These may include scheduling and coordinating promotions,
merchandising, centralized ordering, and data collection services.
MARKETING
We use a combination of sales incentives, trade promotions, and consumer promotions to market our products.
Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances
Lifeway offers various sales incentives and trade promotional programs to its retailer and distributor customers from time to time in the normal course of business. These
sales incentives and trade promotion programs typically include rebates, in-store display and demo allowances, allowances for non-saleable product, coupons, and other
trade promotional activities. Trade promotions support price features, displays, and other merchandising of our products by our retail and distributor customers. We

---


# Page 5 of 34

record these arrangements as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of operations.
Consumer Promotions and Marketing Campaigns
We engage in an ongoing and wide variety of marketing and media campaigns - primarily digital and social media, print advertising, television advertising, and event
marketing. We complement these marketing and media efforts with industry-related trade shows and in-store promotional events. Our consumer marketing efforts also
include cooperative advertising programs with our retail customers and various couponing campaigns, online consumer relationship programs, and other similar forms
of promotions.
Our marketing efforts are aimed at stimulating demand with new and existing consumers by elevating awareness and consumption of kefir and probiotics, as well as
enhancing our brand equity. Our awareness marketing seeks to promote the positive nutritional attributes and flavor of our products.
COMPETITION
Lifeway competes with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently faces a small amount of direct competition for kefir products. However,
Lifeway's kefir-based products compete with other dairy products, such as spoonable and drinkable yogurt, and, increasingly, with non-dairy probiotic products. Many
of our competitors are well-established and have significantly greater financial resources than Lifeway to promote their products.
4
SUPPLIERS
We purchase our ingredients such as milk, pectin, and other ingredients from unaffiliated suppliers. In addition, we purchase significant quantities of packaging materials
to package our products and natural gas and electricity to operate our facilities. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms, and
product specifications vary. Although the prices for our principal inputs can fluctuate based on economic, weather, and other conditions, Lifeway believes it has ready
access to alternative suppliers for all critical ingredients, packaging, and other input requirements.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
During the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers collectively accounted for approximately 22% of our total net sales. Two customers collectively accounted
for approximately 28% of net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.
SEGMENTS
Lifeway has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how our chief operating decision maker manages the business and, in a manner, consistent with the
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
Company performance, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. Substantially all our consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that
we produce using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.
DANONE SA
Since October 1999, Danone SA, through subsidiaries (collectively "Danone"), has been the beneficial owner of approximately 24% of the outstanding common stock
of Lifeway. Lifeway and Danone are parties to a Stockholders' Agreement dated October 1, 1999, which as amended provides Danone the right to designate one director
nominee, provides Danone with anti-dilutive rights relating to certain future offerings and issuances of capital stock, and grants Danone limited registration rights.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that our rights in our trademarks and service marks are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from our
competitors and are a valuable part of our business. We own many domestic and international trademarks and service marks. In addition, we own numerous registered
and unregistered copyrights, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, trade dress, technology, know-how, processes, and other proprietary rights that are
not registered. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have
not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also have
licenses to use certain trademarks inside and outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such
licenses are granted. Lifeway's policy is to pursue registration of intellectual property whenever appropriate. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a
combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and domain name dispute resolution systems; as well as licensing
agreements, third-party confidentiality, nondisclosure, and assignment agreements; and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. We regard the
Lifeway family of trademarks and other intellectual property as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. The loss of
such protection would have a material adverse impact on our operations and share price.
5
REGULATION
Lifeway is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities. In the United States, agencies governing the manufacture, marketing, and
distribution of our products include, among others, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the United States Food & Drug Administration ("FDA"), the United States
Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), and
their state and local equivalents. Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe, among other things, the requirements and standards for quality, safety, and
representation of our products to consumers. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our products and production. For example, as required by the
National Organic Program ("NOP"), we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Additionally, our facilities are subject
to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food
Standards Agency in the United Kingdom; the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Agro-Food Quality (known by its Spanish-language acronym "SENASICA")
and the Federal Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risks ("COFEPRIS") in Mexico; the Food Safety Authority in Ireland; and the European Food Safety
Authority, which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state, and local regulations.
Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or
suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION


---


# Page 6 of 34

Our primary raw material is milk. The federal government establishes minimum prices for raw milk purchased in federally regulated areas. Some states have established
their own rules for determining minimum prices. The federal government announces prices for raw milk each month. While we are subject to federal government
regulations that establish minimum prices for milk, and we also pay producer ("over-order") premiums, federal order administration costs, and other related charges that
vary by milk product, location, and supplier.
FOOD SAFETY
Lifeway takes appropriate precautions to ensure the safety of our products. In addition to routine inspections by state and federal regulatory agencies, including the
USDA and FDA, we have instituted Company-wide quality systems that address topics such as supplier control; ingredient, packaging, and product specifications;
preventive maintenance; pest control; and sanitation. Each of our facilities also has in place a hazard analysis critical control points ("HACCP") plan that identifies
critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards. To the extent that the
federal Food Safety Modernization Act applies to Lifeway's business, we develop food safety plans and implement preventive measures to protect against food
contamination. We also maintain a product recall plan, including lot identifiability and traceability measures that allow us to act quickly to reduce the risk of
consumption of any product that we suspect may pose a health issue.
We maintain various types of insurance, including product liability and product recall coverages, which we believe to be sufficient to cover potential product liabilities.
We have also implemented the SQF program at our Illinois and Wisconsin facilities. SQF is a fully integrated food safety and quality management protocol designed
specifically for the food sector. The SQF Code, based on universally accepted CODEX Alimentarius, HACCP guidelines and the Global Food Safety Initiative ("GFSI")
standards, offers a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality simultaneously. SQF certification provides an independent and external validation
that a product, process or service complies with international, regulatory and other specified standards.
SEASONALITY
Lifeway's business is not seasonal.
6
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 289 full-time and two part-time employees, of which 103 were members of a union bargaining unit.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
Lifeway maintains a corporate website for investors at www.lifewayfoods.com and makes available, free of charge, through this website its annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating and understanding us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in conjunction with all of the other information included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in Part II, Item 7 and
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained in Part II, Item 7A. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may become important factors that adversely affect our business.
If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects
could be materially and adversely affected.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
Our product categories face a high level of competition, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.
We compete with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently face a small amount of direct competition for kefir products. However, our kefir-
based products compete with other dairy products, notably spoonable and drinkable yogurt, and, increasingly, with non-dairy probiotic products that incorporate kefir
cultures but are not kefir. We face significant competition for limited retailer shelf space in each of our product categories. Competition in our product categories is
based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy
consumer tastes and preferences. We believe that our brands have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories, and their success
has attracted competition from other food and beverage companies that produce branded products, as well as from private label competitors. Some of our competitors,
such as Danone, General Mills, Chobani, Hain Celestial Group, and Nestle, have substantial financial and marketing resources. These competitors and others may be
able to introduce innovative products more quickly or market their products more successfully than we can, which could cause our growth rate to be slower than we
anticipate and could cause sales to decline.
We also compete with producers of non-dairy products, such as Millennium Products and PepsiCo, that have lower ingredient and production-related costs. As a result,
these competing producers may be able to offer their products to customers at a lower price point. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability
or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. Furthermore, private label competitors are generally able to sell their products at lower
prices because private label products typically have lower marketing costs than their branded counterparts. If our products fail to compete successfully with other
branded or private label offerings, demand for our products and our sales volumes could be negatively impacted.
Additionally, due to high levels of competition, certain of our key retailers may demand price concessions on our products or may become more resistant to price
increases for our products. Increased price competition and resistance to price increases have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our results of
operations.

We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy for our brands on a timely basis or at all.
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to implement our strategy of leveraging our existing brands with our new products to maintain our
market position in our product categories; drive increased sales; acquire or establish new brands; and create strategic alliances including potential joint ventures. Our
ability to implement this strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to:

---


# Page 7 of 34

enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products;
compete successfully in the product categories in which we choose to operate;
introduce timely, new, cost-effective, and appealing products and innovate successfully within our existing product categories;
develop and maintain consumer interest in and demand for our brands considering prevailing consumer tastes and preferences;
increase our brand recognition and loyalty;
enter into strategic arrangements with third-party suppliers to obtain necessary raw materials;
identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture partners and accurately assess their value, growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other
liabilities, and potential profitability;
negotiate acquisitions and joint ventures on terms acceptable to us; and
integrate acquired brands, products, or joint ventures into our company and our business strategy.
If we fail to execute these and other important elements of our business strategy, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
One key element of our business strategy is to introduce timely, new, cost-effective, and appealing products and to innovate successfully within our existing product
categories. However, consumer tastes and preferences change rapidly, and evolve over time. Factors that may affect consumer tastes and preferences include:
dietary trends and increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sugar, fat, protein, fiber or calorie content of different foods and beverages;
concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, such as sugar, other sweeteners, dairy, soybeans, nuts, oils, vitamins, fiber and
minerals;
concerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people;
decisions by yogurt and non-dairy beverage manufacturers to mislabel their products as "kefir" in order to benefit from our branding and marketing efforts, a
marketing ploy that can cause significant confusion and misunderstanding among consumers; and
increased awareness of the environmental and social effects of food processing.
8
Our future investments may not produce the results we expect when we expect them for a variety of reasons including those described herein. Our future product
development and innovation will be reliant on our ability to identify and develop potential new growth opportunities. This process is inherently risky and will result in
investments of substantial time and resources for which we may not achieve any return or value. Successful product development and innovation is also affected by our
ability to launch new or improved products successfully and on a timely and cost-effective basis.
We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity, equity-linked, or debt securities to fund our business strategy, or may be unable to fund that strategy. Any of these
events could adversely affect our financial results and our business. We could experience similar effects if we invest resources in a strategy that ultimately proves
unsuccessful. If, due to a failure of our strategy or any other reason, consumer demand for our products declines, our sales volumes, results of operations, and our
business could be negatively affected, and we may not be able to create or sustain growth or successfully implement our business strategy.
Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to manufacture or distribute products, could adversely affect our business and sales, and/or could increase
our operating costs and capital expenditures.
We have several supply agreements with suppliers and co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods, including packaging and kefir. For some
of these products, we essentially rely on a single supplier or co-packer as our sole source for the item. The failure for any reason of any such sole source or other co-
packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us or the termination or renegotiation of any such sourcing agreement could result in disruptions to
our supply of finished goods and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our suppliers and co-packers are subject to risk, including labor
disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that
could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods, or require that we incur additional expense by
providing financial accommodations to the supplier or co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing new
arrangements with other providers. A new arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing arrangements, if at all.
Our inability to maintain sufficient internal capacity or establish satisfactory co-packing, warehousing and distribution arrangements could limit our ability to operate
our business or implement our strategic plan and could negatively affect our sales volumes and results of operations.
Disruption of our manufacturing or distribution chains or information technology systems, including disruption due to cybersecurity threats, could adversely affect
our business.
The success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong production platform and we rely primarily on internal production resources to fulfill our
manufacturing needs. Our ongoing initiatives to expand our production platform and our productive capacity could fail to achieve such objectives and, in any case, could
increase our operating costs beyond our expectations and could require significant additional capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain sufficient production,
warehousing, and distribution capacity, either internally or through third party agreements, we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing,
distribution, and warehousing costs may increase, which could negatively affect our business.
Furthermore, damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, environmental incident, terrorism, cybersecurity
threats and other security breaches, pandemic, strikes, the financial or operational instability of key distributors, warehousing, and transportation providers, or other
reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products.
We rely on a limited number of production and distribution facilities. A disruption in operations at any of these facilities or any other disruption in our supply chain
relating to common carriers, supply of raw materials and finished goods, or otherwise, whether as a result of casualty, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications
failure, cybersecurity threat, terrorism, labor shortages, contractual disputes or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business and adversely
affect our relationship with our customers. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs.

Our information technology systems are also critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. These
systems include, without limitation, networks, applications, and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information
technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and sales losses, causing our
business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire,
natural disasters, systems failures, and cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly and include, without limitation, computer
viruses, unauthorized attempts to access information, denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches. Like our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and
other third parties with whom we do business generally, we expect that we will continue to be the subject of cybersecurity threats. In some cases, we must rely on the
safeguards put in place by the third parties with whom we do business to protect against security threats. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures and
controls and have invested in sufficient resources to appropriately identify and monitor these threats and mitigate potential risks, including risks involving our customers
and suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches, disruptions to mission critical systems, the
unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data, or harm to facilities or personnel.
These threats and other events could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties; could require significant
management attention and resources; could result in the loss of business, regulatory actions and potential liability; and could negatively impact our reputation among our
customers and the public. Any of these outcomes could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Our debt and financial obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to obtain future financing, and our ability to operate our business.
We have outstanding debt obligations that could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.
Furthermore, from time to time, we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our business strategy, including strategic acquisitions. Our ability
to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors.
We cannot assure that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,
equity-linked, or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and, in the case of equity and equity-
linked securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.77 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $3,72 million outstanding under the note payable, net of $25
thousand of unamortized deferred financing. Our loan agreements contain certain restrictions and requirements that among other things:

*   require us to maintain a quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum working capital ratio;

*   limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate
    purposes;

*   limit our future ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;

*   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions or in funding our strategic growth plan; and

*   impose on us financial and operational restrictions.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our
assets, borrow more money or raise equity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.

10

Our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, it will increase our debt service requirements, which could
adversely affect our cash flow.
Our loan agreements also contain provisions that restrict our ability to:

*   borrow money or guarantee debt;

*   create liens;

*   make specified types of investments and acquisitions;

*   pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;

*   enter into new lines of business;

*   enter into transactions with affiliates; and

*   sell assets or merge with other companies.

These restrictions on the operation of our business could harm our ability to execute on our business strategy by, among other things, limiting our ability to take
advantage of financing, merger and acquisition opportunities, and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect
our ability to comply with these covenants. Unless cured or waived, a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under the credit agreement and
to foreclose upon the collateral securing the debt.
Loss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and other personnel, could negatively impact our business.
We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced senior management team. We also depend on our
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose one or more members of our senior management team whose
responsibilities cannot otherwise be distributed among our other officers, or if we fail to attract talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be
negatively affected.
Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.
We have a union contract governing the terms and conditions of employment for a significant portion of our workforce. Although we believe union relations since the


---


# Page 9 of 34

union's certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of this portion of our workforce have been amicable, there is no assurance that this will continue in the
future or that we will not be subject to future union organizing activity. There are potential adverse effects of labor disputes with our own employees or by others who
provide warehousing, transportation, and distribution, both domestic and foreign, of our raw materials or other products. Strikes or work stoppages or other business
interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which
could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of
operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated, or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to
fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.

11

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our copyrights, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology,
know-how, processes and other proprietary rights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying
on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, and domain name dispute resolution systems; as well as licensing
agreements, third-party confidentiality, nondisclosure, and assignment agreements; and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain
or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of
our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.

We also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties' intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without
merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property,
require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, divert management's attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to
obtain the right to use a third party's intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements,
or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

The Smolyansky family controls a substantial portion of our common stock and has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval.

Although the members of the Smolyansky family together control less than 50% of our common stock collectively, they could significantly influence any matter
requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of our directors and the approval or rejection of any merger, change of control, or other significant
corporate transaction. It is unlikely that any person interested in acquiring Lifeway will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of some members of the
Smolyansky family. The Smolyansky family's interests may not always be aligned with other stockholders' interests. By exercising their influence, members of the
Smolyansky family could cause Lifeway to take actions that are at odds with the investment goals of institutional, short-term, non-voting, or other non-controlling
investors, or that have a negative effect on our stock price.

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of stockholders.

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder actions, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy,
and impact the trading value of our securities. Stockholder actions, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and our
Board, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. We may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to stockholder
actions, and the attention of our management may be diverted by such actions. While we welcome our stockholders' constructive input, there can be no assurance that
stockholder actions would not result in negative impacts to the Company. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results,
and the market price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by stockholder actions.

12
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY
The consolidation of our customers or the loss of any of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.

Customers, such as supermarkets and food distributors, continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased
negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases or demand increased promotional programs, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the
number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail
customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business.

Two of our customers together accounted for 22% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Where we enter into written agreements with our
customers, they are generally terminable after short notice periods by the customer. In addition, our customers sometimes award contracts based on competitive bidding,
which could result in lower profits for contracts we win and the loss of business for contracts we lose. The loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels,
or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended period of time could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.

We rely on sales made by or through our independent distributors to customers. Distributors purchase directly for their own account for resale. The loss of, or business
disruption at, one or more of these distributors may harm our business. If we are required to obtain additional or alternative distribution agreements or arrangements in
the future, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory distribution agreements
may inhibit our ability to implement our business plan or to establish markets necessary to expand the distribution of our products successfully.

We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims, which could harm our reputation, force us to recall products and incur substantial
costs.

The sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties,
inadvertent mislabeling, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during
the storage, processing, handling or transportation phases. We also may be subject to liability if our products or production processes violate applicable laws or
regulations, including environmental, health, and safety requirements, or in the event our products cause injury, illness, or death.

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall or withdraw products, suspend production of our products, or cease operations, which may lead to a material
adverse effect on our business. In addition, customers may cancel orders for such products as a result of such events. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or
market withdrawal, and even if we and each of our co-packers and suppliers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we may become
subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any
assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm, including the risk of reputational harm being magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of
information over the Internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms, and social media, could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential


---


# Page 10 of 34

customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this type might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of
indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability and product recall insurance in amounts that we believe to be adequate.
However, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product
liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
13
We rely on independent certification for several of our products and facilities.
We rely on independent certification, such as certifications of our products as "organic," or "gluten-free," to differentiate our products from others. The loss of any
independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as a probiotic-based product and natural, "better for you" foods company, which could harm our
business. We rely on independent SQF certification at some of our facilities, a certification that some of our customers require us to maintain.
We must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified. For example, we can lose our
"organic" certification if a manufacturing plant becomes contaminated with non-organic materials, or if it is not properly cleaned after a production run. In addition, all
organic raw materials must be certified organic or organic compliant. Our products could lose their organic certifications if our raw material suppliers lose their organic
certifications. Similarly, we could lose our SQF certification if we do not meet the requirements of the SQF Code. The loss of these certifications could cause us to lose
customers that require Lifeway products and/or facilities to carry some or all of them, which could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.
Increases in the cost of raw milk could reduce our gross margin and profit.
Conventional and organic raw milk, our primary raw material, is an agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Both conventional and organic milk
prices in fiscal 2022 were higher than the prior year, and there can be no assurance that such prices will remain at these levels in the future. The supply and price of raw
milk may be impacted by, among other things, weather, natural disasters, real or perceived supply shortages, lower dairy and crop yields, general increases in farm
inputs and costs of production, political and economic conditions, labor actions, government actions, and trade barriers. Increases in the market price for raw milk or
over-order premiums charged by producers may also impact our ability to enter into purchase commitments at a fixed price. There can be no assurance that our
purchasing practices will mitigate future price risk. As a result, increases in the cost of raw milk could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
In addition, the dairy industry continues to experience periodic imbalances between supply and demand for organic raw milk. Industry regulation and the costs of
organic farming compared to costs of conventional farming can impact the supply of organic raw milk in the market. Oversupply levels of organic raw milk can increase
competitive pressure on our products and pricing, while supply shortages can cause higher input costs and reduce our ability to deliver product to our customers. Cost
increases in raw materials and other inputs could cause our profits to decrease significantly compared to prior periods, as we may be unable to increase our prices to
offset the increased cost of these raw materials and other inputs. If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any increased costs
for such raw materials and inputs, our business could be negatively affected.
Reduced availability of raw materials and other inputs, as well as increased costs for them, could adversely affect us.
Our business depends heavily on raw materials and other inputs in addition to conventional and organic raw milk, such as sweeteners, diesel fuel, packaging material,
resin, and other commodities. Our raw materials are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, and we are not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive
access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In 2022, costs to us increased primarily due to inflationary price increases of other ingredients, packaging materials,
and freight. However, for market conditions or competitive reasons, our pricing actions may also lag input cost changes, or we may not be able to pass along the full
effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them.
The organic ingredients we use in some of our products are less plentiful and available from a fewer number of suppliers than their conventional counterparts.
Competition with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic product ingredients may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic products increases.
14
Our business is subject to various food, environmental, and health and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our compliance costs, subject us to
liabilities, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
Our business operations are subject to numerous requirements in the United States relating to food safety, production, and marketing, as well as the protection of the
environment, and health and safety matters. The food production and marketing industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations,
including food safety requirements related to the ingredients, manufacture, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, and distribution of our products, as well
as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to extensive regulation. We are regulated by,
among other federal and state authorities, the FDA, USDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and the U.S. Departments of Commerce, and Labor, as well as
by similar authorities in the foreign countries in which we do business. Environmental laws including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as
similar state and local statutes and regulations in the United States and in each of the foreign countries in which we do business apply to our business operations as well.
These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants, the use of refrigerants, the handling and
disposal of hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination in the environment.
In addition, the marketing and advertising of our products could make us the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and
foreign laws and regulations, and we may be subject to initiatives that limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children.
We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our organic products and production. For example, as required by the National Organic Program ("NOP"),
we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Regulations and formal and informal positions taken by the NOP pursuant
to the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, which created the NOP, are subject to continued review and scrutiny.
Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs, increase other costs of doing business for us,
our customers, or our suppliers, or restrict our actions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In some cases, new laws and regulations or other federal
and state regulatory initiatives could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes and our products. Governmental regulations also
affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of
our customers or suppliers. These costs could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we are found to be in violation of applicable
laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, fines, injunctions, recalls,
cleanup costs, and other civil sanctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
RISKS RELATED TO COVID-19 AND OTHER PANDEMIC OR DISEASE OUTBREAKS
Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt consumption and trade patterns, supply chains, available labor supply, and

---


# Page 11 of 34

production processes, which could materially affect our operations and results of operations.
The ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak will have on our business and our consolidated results of operations is
uncertain.
To date we have seen increased customer and consumer demand for our products. We have not experienced significant supply chain disruptions or labor supply
shortages and we have continued to be able to satisfy customer and consumer demand for our products. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic,
may limit the availability of, or increase the cost of, employees, ingredients, packaging and other inputs necessary to produce our products, and our operations may be
negatively impacted. In 2022, our costs increased primarily due to inflationary price increases of milk, other ingredients, packaging materials, and freight. However,
because of market conditions or for competitive reasons, our pricing actions may sometimes lag input cost changes, or we may not be able to pass along the full effect of
increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them.
15
In 2022, social distancing, shelter-in-place and work-from-home mandates and recommendations have begun to be reduced or eliminated. The increased customer
demand we have realized over the past two years as consumers increased their at-home consumption and e-commerce purchasing during the COVID-19 pandemic may
change or decrease due to the decrease in social distancing and stay-at-home and work-from-home mandates and recommendations. We are unable to predict the nature
and timing of when such change may occur, if at all.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on many factors, including, among others, whether additional waves of COVID-19 or
different variants of COVID-19 will affect the United States and other markets and the duration of any social distancing and stay home and work from home mandates
or recommendations that may occur as a result of such COVID-19 wave or variant; our ability and the ability of our suppliers to continue to maintain production despite
unprecedented demand in the food industry, supply chain disruptions, tight labor markets and increased raw materials and packaging costs; and the extent to which
macroeconomic conditions resulting from the pandemic and the pace of the subsequent recovery impact consumer eating and shopping habits. We cannot predict the
duration or scope of the disruption or the impact of any recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. Therefore, the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this
time.
Future pandemics or disease outbreaks could similarly adversely affect economies and financial markets, consumer spending and confidence levels and result in an
economic downturn that affects customer demand for our products. Our efforts to manage and mitigate these risks may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these
efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any pandemic or disease outbreak, as well as third party actions taken to contain its
spread and mitigate public health effects.

(a) During the fourth quarter of 2015, Lifeway publicly announced a share repurchase program. On November 1, 2017, our Board of Directors amended the
2015 stock repurchase program (the "2017 amendment"), by adding to (i.e., exclusive of the shares previously authorized under the 2015 stock program
repurchase) the authorization the lesser of $5,185 or 625 shares. The program has no expiration date. As of April 2020, the Company had reached the
amended threshold of 625 shares and therefore no shares of common stock remain available to be purchased under the 2017 Repurchase Plan Amendment.
On June 24, 2021, our Board authorized a plan to repurchase up to 250 shares of Common Stock in the open market within 24 months at no more than $10
per share (the "2021 Repurchase Plan"). As of December 31, 2021, the Company had reached the threshold of 250 shares and therefore no shares of
common stock remain available to be purchased under the 2021 Repurchase Plan Amendment.
(b) On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Ludmila Smolyansky ("Ms. Smolyansky"), to purchase 850,340 shares
of Lifeway common stock from Ms. Smolyansky in a privately negotiated share repurchase (the "Share Repurchase"). The Share Repurchase closed on
November 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to
historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements within the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to our future plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. These statements may be identified by the use of words such as
"may," "could," "believe," "future," "depend," "expect," "will," "result," "can," "remain," "assurance," "subject to," "require," "limit," "impose," "guarantee," "restrict,"
"continue," "become," "predict," "likely," "opportunities," "effect," "change," "future," "predict," and "estimate," and similar terms or terminology, or the negative of
such terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions
within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. Factors that could contribute to
such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.

Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
We have seen increased customer and consumer demand for our products during the pandemic as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption.
We have not experienced significant supply chain disruptions or labor supply shortages and have continued to satisfy customer and consumer demand for our products.
Management continues to proactively manage the supply and transportation of materials used to make and package our products, staffing, and transportation of our
products to customers. This proactive planning has allowed the Company to avoid disruption to its manufacturing facilities and production, transportation, and sales and
to meet the increased demand. The Company has maintained full production capacity available at all locations and does not anticipate manufacturing or staffing
disruptions in the near term.
However, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic, may limit the availability of, or increase the cost of, employees, ingredients, packaging and other inputs
necessary to produce our products, and our operations may be negatively impacted. In 2022, our costs increased primarily due to inflationary price increases of milk,
other ingredients, packaging materials, and transportation to our customers. However, because of market conditions or for competitive reasons, our pricing actions may

sometimes lag input cost changes, or we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them.
During 2022, social distancing, shelter-in-place and work-from-home mandates and recommendations have continued to be reduced or eliminated. The increased
customer demand for our products as consumers increased their at-home consumption and e-commerce purchasing during the COVID-19 pandemic may change or
decrease due to the decrease in social distancing and stay-at-home and work-from-home mandates and recommendations. We are unable to predict the nature and timing
of when such change may occur, if at all.

<br>

Net Sales
<br>

Net sales were $141,568 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $22,503 or 18.9% versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher
volumes of our branded drinkable kefir and the impact of price increases implemented during the year, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of our acquisition of
Glen Oaks Farms during the third quarter of 2021. Approximately 18% of the net sales increase results from the full year 2022 impact of our acquisition of Glen Oaks
Farms during the third quarter of 2021.
<br>

Gross Profit
<br>

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 18.9% during the year ended December 31, 2022 from 24.1% during the same period in 2021. The decrease versus
the prior year was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of milk pricing, and the inflationary price increases of other ingredients, packaging materials, and freight,
partially offset by the decrease in depreciation expense and favorable labor efficiency due to increased volumes. We took favorable pricing actions during 2022 to
recover a portion of the input and freight cost inflation. However, for market conditions or competitive reasons, our pricing actions may also lag input cost changes, or
we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them.
<br>

Selling Expenses
<br>

Selling expenses increased by $207 to $11,304 during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11,097 during the same period in 2021. The increase versus prior year is
primarily due to increased investment in advertising and marketing programs, increased broker expense, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
<br>

General and Administrative Expenses
<br>

General and administrative expenses increased $982 to $12,593 during the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11,611 during the same period in 2021. The increase is
primarily a result of increased legal and professional fees, which include expense related to non-routine stockholder action, the fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K restatement,
and incentive compensation, partially offset by lower consulting expense to our former Chairperson of the Board of Directors.
<br>

Provision for Income Taxes
<br>

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $917 and $2,305 during the year ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.
<br>

Our effective income tax rate was 49.1% in 2022 compared to 41.0% in 2021. The statutory Federal and state tax rates remained consistent from 2021 to 2022. The
Company has a number of items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer
compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from year to year. Although similar items
were reflected in 2022, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2022 compared to 2021.


---


# Page 14 of 34

Our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the
underlying income tax rates applicable to various state and local taxing jurisdictions, enacted tax legislation, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation
allowances, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. We record discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes
in the period in which they occur.

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") limits the deductibility of compensation paid to certain of our executives to the extent their total
compensation exceeds $1 million in any taxable year.

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Income (Loss)

We reported net income of $924 or $0.06 per basic and diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $3,311 or $0.21 per
basic and diluted common share in the same period in 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company remains in a
strong financial position, and while it has been impacted by the macroeconomic challenges with commodity inflation and other input cost increases, the Company
believes that its cash flow from operations, revolving credit and term loan facility, and cash and cash equivalents will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for its
working capital needs, capital resource requirements, and growth initiatives and to ensure the continuation of the Company as a going concern.

If additional borrowings are needed, $2,223 was available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 7, Debt). We are in compliance with
the terms of the Credit Agreement and expect to meet foreseeable financial requirements. The success of our business and financing strategies will continue to provide us
with the financial flexibility to take advantage of various opportunities as they arise. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and obtaining financing as
needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company' most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor,
manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, and income tax liabilities) as well as expenditures for property, plant, and equipment.

Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (see Note 7, Debt) and deferred income taxes (see Note 10, Income Taxes).

The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,987 in 2022 compared to $5,564 in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash earnings, which reflect the
impact of input and freight cost inflation in 2022, and the change in working capital.

21

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $4,029 in 2022 compared to $7,142 in 2021. The decrease in cash used reflects the August 2021 acquisition of GlenOaks Farms,
Inc., partially offset by increased capital spending in 2022. Our capital spending is focused in three core areas: growth, cost reduction, and facility improvements.
Growth capital spending supports new product innovation and enhancements. Cost reduction and facility improvements support manufacturing efficiency, safety, and
productivity.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $4,747 during 2022 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2,885 in 2021. The decrease in cash used relates to
the term loan entered into during August 2021 in connection with the acquisition of GlenOaks Farms, Inc., partially offset by the quarterly principal payments under the
term loan.

On June 24, 2021, Lifeway's Board authorized a plan to repurchase up to 250 shares of Common Stock in the open market within 24 months at no more than $10 per
share. We repurchased all 250 shares of common stock at a cost of $1,583 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2021. We intend to hold repurchased
shares in treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Treasury shares are accounted for using the cost method.

On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Ludmila Smolyansky ("Ms. Smolyansky"), to purchase 850,340 shares of Lifeway
common stock from Ms. Smolyansky, Board of Director member. The shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company and Ms. Smolyansky have agreed, among other things, that (i) Ms. Smolyansky will sell the shares at a
purchase price of $4.70 per share, which represents a twenty percent (20.0%) discount to the average closing price of the common stock on Nasdaq over the five (5)
trading day period ended on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) Ms. Smolyansky will use a portion of the proceeds
to satisfy in full certain obligations of Ms. Smolyansky, which are secured by previously disclosed pledges of common stock, causing all such pledges to be released.
The purchased shares will be held in treasury by the Company.

Debt Obligations

# Page 15 of 34

On August 18, 2021, Lifeway entered into the Fourth Modification (the "Fourth Modification") to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as
amended and modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with its existing lender and certain of its subsidiaries. The Fourth Modification amends the Credit
Agreement to provide for, among other things, a $5 million term loan by the existing lender to the borrowers to be repaid in quarterly installments of principal and
interest over a term of five years (the "Term Loan"). The termination date of the Term Loan is August 18, 2026, unless earlier terminated. Except for the addition of the
Term Loan, the Credit Agreement remains substantively unchanged and in full force and effect.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,777 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $3,727 outstanding under the note payable, net of $23 of unamortized
deferred financing fees. We had $2,223 available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. As amended, all outstanding
amounts under the Loans bear interest, at Lifeway's election, at either the lender Base Rate (the Prime Rate minus 1.00%) or the LIBOR plus 1.95%, payable monthly in
arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused line fee of 0.20% on the Revolving Credit Facility and, in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of
credit, a letter of credit fee of 0.20%.
The Company's interest rate on debt outstanding under the revolving line of credit and note payable as of December 31, 2022 was 6.17% and 6.29%, respectively.
We are in compliance with all applicable financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2022. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding our indebtedness and related agreements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.
Contractual Obligations
Not applicable.
22
Critical Accounting Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular
transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP with no need for the application of our judgement. In certain circumstances, the preparation of our Consolidated
Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net
sales and expenses during the reporting period. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however, materially different amounts
might be reported under different conditions or using assumptions, estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Management has discussed
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies.
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill totaled $11,704 as of December 31, 2022. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2022. Our assessment did not
result in an impairment. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. We
estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit annually (as of December 31), or more frequently if certain conditions exist, using a combination of the fair values
derived from both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of
estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on our estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and
market conditions. The discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant
risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The market approach
estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment
characteristics. The resulting fair value, based on the income and market approaches, is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary.
Sales discounts & allowance
We offer various trade promotions and sales incentive programs to customers and consumers. From time to time, we grant certain sales discounts to customers which are
classified as a reduction in sales. The measurement and recognition of discounts and allowances involve the use of judgment and our estimates are made based on
historical experience and specific customer program accruals. Differences between estimated and actual discount and allowance costs are normally not material and are
recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. The process for analyzing trade promotion programs could impact our results of operations and
trade spending accruals depending on how actual results of the programs compare to original estimates. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1,800 of accrued discounts
and allowances.
Share-based compensation
Certain employees and non-employee directors receive various forms of share-based payment awards, and we recognize compensation expense for these awards based
on their grant date fair values. The grant fair value of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") and Performance Share Unit ("PSUs") awards is equal to the Company's closing
stock price on the grant date. The Company granted RSU and PSU awards during 2022 to employees under the 2022 long-term incentive-based plan, and RSU awards to
non-employee Directors under the 2022 Non-Employee Director Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan. We do not estimate forfeitures in measuring the grant date
fair value, but rather account for forfeitures as they occur. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.
23
Income taxes
We pay income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any given time, multiple tax years are subject
to audit by the various taxing authorities. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage
our underlying businesses.
We recognize an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The income tax benefit recognized in our financial statements from such a position is measured based on the

---


# Page 16 of 34

largest estimated benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may
change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may
increase or decrease in any period, which would impact our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets
over time.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2021, the related
consolidated statement of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCАОВ.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.

LIFEWAY FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2022 and 2021
(In thousands)
Note 1 - Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements include all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively "Lifeway" or the "Company"). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgement to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported
amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated
financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based and incentive compensation, and
deferred income taxes.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed an assessment of the useful life of its $3,700 indefinite-lived brand name intangible asset and determined that
it should adjust the estimated useful life from an indefinite length to 15 years. The change in accounting estimate was effective January 1, 2022, at which time the
Company began amortizing the asset over 15 years. The future amortization expense is included in the five-year intangible asset amortization table in Note 5 - Goodwill
and Intangible Assets.
Going Concern
The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern which requires
management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure in certain circumstances. There were no conditions or events,
when considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued.
Cash and cash equivalents
Lifeway considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
are stated at cost, which approximates or equals fair value due to their short-term nature.
Lifeway from time to time may have bank deposits in excess of insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. Lifeway has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes the financial risks associated with these
financial instruments are minimal.
F-7
The Company has no restricted cash as of December 31, 2022. The Restricted cash escrow funds of $580 were deposited by Lifeway in connection with the September
18, 2021 acquisition of certain assets of Glen Oaks Farms, Inc. The funds are security for the liability and indemnity obligations of seller as defined under the asset
purchase agreement. The escrow funds were remitted to the sellers in August 2022.
Revenue Recognition
Lifeway sells food and beverage products across select product categories to customers predominantly within the United States (see Note 12 - Segments, Products and
Customers). The Company also sells bulk cream, a byproduct of its fluid milk manufacturing process. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, Lifeway recognizes revenue when control over the products transfers to its customers, which generally occurs upon delivery to its customers or their
common carriers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or
services, using the five-step method required by ASC 606.
For the Company, the contract is the approved sales order, which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with
customers. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer's ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's
historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer, which is the delivery of food and
beverage products which provide immediate benefit to the customer.
Lifeway accounts for product shipping and handling as fulfillment activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost
of goods sold. Any taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues.
Variable consideration, which includes known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, allowances for non-saleable products, product
returns, trade incentives and coupon redemption, is estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.
Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year
or shorter duration. As such, the Company does not capitalize contract inception costs and it capitalizes product fulfillment costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP and its
inventory policies. It generally does not receive noncash consideration for the sale of goods, nor does it grant payment financing terms greater than one year.

Accounts Receivable
Lifeway provides credit terms to customers in-line with industry standards and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience. Customer
balances are written off after all collection efforts are exhausted. Estimated product returns, which have not been material, are deducted from sales at the time of revenue
recognition. The Company does not charge interest on past due accounts receivable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, valued on a first in, first out basis ("FIFO"). The costs of finished goods inventories include raw
materials, direct labor, and overhead costs. Inventories are stated net of reserves for excess or obsolete inventory.

F-8
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Asset</th>
<th>Useful Life</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Buildings and improvements</td>
<td>10-39 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Machinery and equipment</td>
<td>5-12 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Office equipment</td>
<td>3-7 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vehicles</td>
<td>5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leasehold improvements</td>
<td>Shorter of expected useful life or lease term</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The Company performs impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the assets, are expensed as incurred.
Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. Lifeway estimates the fair value of
its one reporting unit annually (as of December 31), or more frequently if certain conditions exist, using a combination of the fair values derived from both the income
approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, it calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash flow projections are based on the Company's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions.
The discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with
business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value
based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics. The
resulting fair value, based on the income and market approaches, is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives
are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Asset</th>
<th>Useful Life</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Recipes</td>
<td>4 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Brand names</td>
<td>8-15 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Formula</td>
<td>10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer lists</td>
<td>5-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer relationships</td>
<td>15 years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

All amortization expense related to intangible assets is recorded in Amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

F-9
Amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Lifeway conducts more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist, such as a change in the competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new
or different strategies, a loss of a significant customer, or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for its products or changes in the
size of the market for its products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is
generally based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible
asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
Fair value measurements
Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability.

Lifeway's financial assets and liabilities that are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and revolving line of credit for which carrying value approximates fair value.
The Company records its investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting
from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company has
one investment without a readily determinable fair value which is recorded at $1,800 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The investment cost of $1,800
includes a cumulative unrealized gain of $1,731 resulting from an observable price change in 2019. There were no upward or downward adjustments to the investment
cost during 2022 or 2021.
Income taxes
The Provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes currently payable, and those deferred because of temporary differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected
to be realized or settled. The principal sources of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes,
incentive compensation, unrealized gain, capitalization of indirect inventory costs for tax purposes, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and the allowance for
doubtful accounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax
expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period.

F-10

Lifeway analyzes filing positions in all the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions.
The Company recognizes the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be
sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. It applies a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and
derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, Lifeway recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized
upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For
those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria
under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Lifeway recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income
taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation expense is recognized for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value. The fair value of restricted stock awards
is equal to the closing price of Lifeway's stock on the date of grant. The Company does not estimate forfeitures in measuring the grant date fair value, but rather account
for forfeitures as they occur. The Company issues share based equity awards from treasury shares.
Treasury stock
Treasury stock is recorded using the cost method.
Advertising costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported in Selling expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Expenditures totaled $,353 and
$3,267 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Earnings (loss) per common share
Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares issued and outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding and the effect of all dilutive common stock equivalents related to the
Company's outstanding stock-based compensation awards outstanding during the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 322
and 236 common stock equivalents outstanding, respectively.
Segments
The Company is managed as a single reportable segment. The Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), reviews
financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and assessing financial performance, as well as for making strategic operational
decisions and managing the organization. Substantially all of Lifeway's consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that it produces using the same
processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.

F-11
Recent accounting pronouncements
Issued but not yet effective
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The new guidance provides a single comprehensive accounting model on
revenue recognition for contracts with customers and requires that the acquirer in a business combination recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired
in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. With early adoption, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all
business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of adoption and prospectively to
all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. Management does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.
The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR
or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The guidance will be effective prospectively as of March 12, 2020 through
December 31, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management will adopt this new guidance effective January 1, 2023, and does not expect the adoption
of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, in
November 2018 issued an amendment, ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, and in November 2019 issued
two amendments, ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates, and
ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring
entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments,
including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective transition or
modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

Goodwill
The Company performed the annual impairment assessment of goodwill for its single reporting unit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, noting no impairment loss.
Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Lifeway estimates fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques
including discounted cash flows and market multiples analysis with respect to its single reporting unit. These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of
factors, including estimates of future growth rates, its cost of capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, and other variables. Assumptions used in the Company's
valuations were consistent with its internal projections and operating plans. Lifeway's discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by a change in the
competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies, a loss of a significant customer, or a significant change in the market place including
changes in the prices paid for its products or changes in the size of the market for its products. Additionally, under the market approach analysis, the Company used
significant other observable inputs including various guideline company comparisons. Lifeway bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable,
but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the
conclusions of the quantitative goodwill test for the Company's one reporting unit.

Approximately $1,664 of goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.

when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement, as a result of which amounts due under the Modified Credit Agreement
may be accelerated. The loans and all other amounts due and owed under the Credit Agreement and related documents are secured by substantially all of the Company's
assets.
Lifeway was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum working capital covenants at December 31, 2022.
Revolving Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $2,777 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Lifeway had $2,223 available for future borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022. Lifeway's interest rate on debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 was
6.17%.
Deferred Financing Costs
As of December 31, 2022, net unamortized deferred financing costs of $23 related to the term loan were included as a direct deduction from outstanding long-term debt.
Note 8 - Leases
The Company leases certain machinery and equipment with fixed base rent payments and variable costs based on usage. Remaining lease terms for these leases range
from less than one year to five years. The Company includes lease extension options, if applicable and reasonably certain to be exercised, in the calculation of the right-
of-use asset and lease liabilities. Lifeway includes only fixed payments for lease components in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Variable
lease payments are those that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. There are no
residual value guarantees. Lifeway does not currently have leases which meet the finance lease classification as defined under ASC 842.
Lifeway treats contracts as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, it directs the
use of the asset and obtain substantially all the economic benefits of the asset.
The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. Expense for these short-term leases is recorded on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Total lease expense was $229 and $304 (including short term leases) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
F-16
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the
commencement date. Lifeway has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components into a single component for all of its leases. When the
Company is unable to determine an implicit interest rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in
determining the present value of future payments for those leases. Lifeway includes options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset
and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
Future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:

The weighted-average remaining lease term for its operating leases was2.7 years as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average discount rate of its operating leases
was 11.70% as of December 31, 2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $51 and $198 for the year ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.
Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
Lifeway is involved in various legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters, audits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of, or incidental to the
Company's business, including commercial disputes, product liabilities, intellectual property matters and employment-related matters.
Lifeway records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of
such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a periodic basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and
developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, it does not establish
an accrued liability. Currently, none of its accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial position and it is
management's opinion that the ultimate resolution of these outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results
of operations, or cash flows. However, if the Company is ultimately required to make payments in connection with an adverse outcome, it is possible that such
contingency could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 11-Stock-based and Other Compensation

Omnibus Incentive Plan

In December 2015, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of3.5 million shares to satisfy
awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units to qualifying
employees. Under the Plan, the Board or its Audit and Corporate Governance Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives,
generally in the form of restricted stock or performance shares. The number of performance shares that participants may earn depends on the extent to which the
corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Stock awards generally vest over a three-year performance or service period. At December 31, 2022, no shares
remain available for award under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan as it was terminated on August 31, 2022. However, any outstanding awards under the 2015 Omnibus
Incentive Plan are unaffected by the termination of the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan or by the approval of the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2022 Plan") as
described below.

On August 31, 2022, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2022 Plan. Under the 2022 Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant awards of
various types of compensation, including, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The maximum number of shares authorized to be awarded under the 2022 Plan
is 3.25 million shares of common stock, which includes shares that remained available under the now terminated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

F-19

Awards granted under the 2022 Plan are generally subject to a minimum vesting period of at least one year. Awards may be subject to cliff-vesting or graded-vesting
conditions, with graded vesting starting no earlier than one year after the grant date. The Plan Administrator may provide for shorter vesting periods in an award
agreement for no more than five percent of the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2022 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 3.00 million shares
remain available to award under the 2022 Plan.

Lifeway measures the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term of options granted was based on the weighted average
time of vesting and the end of the contractual term. The Company utilized this simplified method as it did not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a
reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.

Restricted Stock Awards

A Restricted Stock Award ("RSA") represents the right to receive one share of common stock in the future. RSAs have no exercise price. The grant date fair value of the
awards is equal to the Company's closing stock price on the grant date. The following table summarizes RSA activity during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Lifeway expenses RSAs over the service period. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations was $279 and $264, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 tax-related benefits of $78 and $76,
respectively, were also recognized. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unearned compensation related to non-vested RSAs was $520, which is expected to be
amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.55 years.

Long-Term Incentive Plan Compensation

Lifeway has established long-term incentive-based compensation programs for certain senior executives and key employees pursuant to the terms of its incentive plans.

2020 CEO Incentive Award

During the fourth quarter 2020, Lifeway awarded a long-term equity-based incentive of $750 to its Chief Executive Officer (the "2020 CEO Award") depending on
Lifeways 2020 performance levels compared to the respective targets. The equity-based incentive compensation is payable in restricted stock that vests one-third in
April 2022, one-third in April 2023, and one-third in April 2024. The issuance of vested equity awards is subject to approval under the Stock Purchase Agreement dated
October 1, 1999. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $229 and $342 was expensed as stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements
of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unearned compensation was $129, of which $105 will be recognized in 2023, and $24 in 2024,
respectively, subject to vesting. During Q2 2021, the number of shares became fixed and determinable. Therefore, the award liability was reclassified from long-term
liabilities to paid in capital.

2021 Equity Award

The 2021 long-term equity incentive plan compensation is based on Lifeway's achievement of adjusted EBITDA performance versus the respective target established by
the Board for 2021. Under the 2021 plan, collectively the participants earned equity-based incentive compensation of $1,069 based on Lifeway's achievement of the
respective financial target. The equity-based incentive compensation is payable in restricted stock that vests one-third in April 2022, one-third in April 2023, and one-
third in April 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $449 and $386 was expensed as stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated
statements of operations, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unearned compensation was $234, of which $194 will be recognized in 2023, and
$40 in 2024, respectively, subject to vesting. During Q2 2022, the number of shares awarded became fixed and determinable. Therefore, the award liability was
reclassified from long-term liabilities to paid in capital.

2022 Equity Award

Under the 2022 long-term incentive plan, participants can earn a specified number of target level Performance Share Units ("PSUs") contingent upon the achievement of
strategic milestones during the three-year measurement period, which is fiscal year 2022 to 2024. The strategic milestones are 1) 3-year cumulative net revenue, and 2)
3-year cumulative adjusted EBITDA. The target number of PSU awards are weighted 50% on net revenue and 50% on adjusted EBITDA. Collectively, the participants
can earn 125,066 PSUs at the target level. Participants may earn more or less than the target number of shares based on actual results, however the minimum and
maximum number of shares that can be earned are bound by minimum and maximum thresholds of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The PSU awards will be earned
and will vest, if at all, after the end of the three-year measurement period based on achievement of the milestones. The PSU awards do not vest during the three-year
measurement period. The PSUs have a grant date fair value of $6.25 dollars per share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, $151 was expensed as stock-
based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations, respectively.

The 2022 long-term incentive plan also granted restricted stock unit awards that contain only a service condition and vest on the passage of time in three equal
installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the August 31, 2022 grant date. The stock-based compensation expense for these awards is included in the
Restricted Stock Award section above.

F-21

Non-Employee Director Plan

On August 31, 2022, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2022 Non-Employee Director Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan (the '2022 Director Plan"), which
authorizes the grant of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which will vest on such schedule as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Each non-employee
director of the Company is eligible to be a participant in the 2022 Director Plan until they no longer serve as a non-employee director. As of the date of each annual
shareholder meeting, the Company may grant each director a number of RSUs for such year and set the vesting schedule for the RSUs granted. Whether and how many
RSUs the Company will grant to directors in any year is subject to the sole discretion of the Company and shall in any event be subject to the 2022 Director Plan's
overall share limits. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2022 Directors Plan is 500 thousand shares. As of
December 31, 2022, 466 thousand shares remain available to award under the 2022 Director Plan. The aggregate fair market value of shares underlying RSU
compensation that may be issued as RSU compensation to a director in any year shall not exceed $170. In addition to the grant of RSUs, the 2022 Director Plan also
provides for the deferral by electing participants of all or part of their cash compensation (in 10% increments) into a deferred cash account, and they may defer all or part
of their cash and/or RSU compensation (in 10% increments) into a deferred RSU account. Deferred benefits are paid in a lump sum upon the applicable director's
departure from the Board of Directors.

Retirement Benefits

Lifeway has a defined contribution plan which is available to substantially all full-time employees. Under the terms of the plan we match employee contributions under
a prescribed formula. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 total contribution expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations was $446 and
$432, respectively.

Note 12-Segments, Products and Customers

Lifeway's primary product is drinkable kefir. The Company manufactures (directly or through a co-manufacturer) and markets products under the Lifeway, Fresh Made,
and GlenOaks Farms brand names, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers.

The Company's product categories are:

*   Drinkable Kefir, a cultured dairy product sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types.
*   European-style soft cheeses, including farmer cheese, white cheese, and Sweet Kiss.
*   Cream and other, which primarily consists of cream, a byproduct of raw milk processing.
*   Drinkable Yogurt, sold in a variety of sizes and flavors.
*   ProBugs, a line of kefir products designed for children.
*   Other Dairy, which primarily consists of Fresh Made butter and sour cream.

Lifeway has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how its chief operating decision maker manages the business and, in a manner, consistent with the
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the
Company's performance, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. Substantially all of Lifeway's consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy
products that it produces using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.

Net sales of products by category were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Note 13 - Share repurchase program

Pursuant to the share repurchase program, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchasedl 79 shares at a cost of $405 or approximately $2.27 per
share. During 2020, the Company reached the amended threshold of 625 shares and therefore no shares of common stock remain available to be purchased under the
2017 Repurchase Plan Amendment as of December 31, 2020.

On June 24, 2021, the Lifeway's Board authorized a plan to repurchase up to 250 shares of Common Stock in the open market within 24 months at no more than $10
per share (the "2021 Repurchase Plan"). The Company repurchased all 250 shares of common stock at a cost of $1,583 during the three-month period ended September
30, 2021. Lifeway intends to hold repurchased shares in treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under its 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Treasury
shares are accounted for using the cost method.

Stock Purchase Agreement

On November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Ludmila Smolyansky ("Ms. Smolyansky"), to purchase850,340 shares of Lifeway
common stock from Ms. Smolyansky. The shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company and Ms. Smolyansky have agreed, among other things, that (i) Ms. Smolyansky will sell the shares at a
purchase price of $4.70 per share, which represents a twenty percent (20.0%) discount to the average closing price of the common stock on Nasdaq over the five (5)
trading day period ended on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) Ms. Smolyansky will use a portion of the proceeds
to satisfy in full certain obligations of Ms. Smolyansky, which are secured by previously disclosed pledges of common stock, causing all such pledges to be released.
The purchased shares will be held in treasury by the Company.

As a closing condition to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Ms. Smolyansky and Mr. Smolyansky delivered an executed amendment (the "Amendment") to that certain
Settlement Agreement dated as of July 27, 2022 (the "Settlement Agreement"), between the Company and Ms. Smolyansky and Mr. Smolyansky. Pursuant to the
Amendment, Ms. Smolyansky and Mr. Smolyansky each agree, among other things, to (i) grant the Company a right of first refusal, subject to Danone North America
Public Benefit Corporation's ("Danone") right of first refusal, on substantially similar terms as Danone (ii) extend the standstill and all related terms under the Proxy
Settlement Agreement through the date of the 2024 annual meeting of the Company's shareholders (the "Standstill"); and (iii) to appear in person or by proxy and vote
their respective remaining shares of common stock beneficially owned, individually or otherwise, and controlled by either of them and over which they have power and
authority to vote during the Standstill (a) in accordance with the recommendations of the Board at any special meeting or annual meeting of the shareholders with respect
to any proposal(s) not related to the sale of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; and (b) in proportion to the vote of the other
shareholders with respect to any proposal relating to any vote on the sale of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

Consulting Services

Lifeway obtains consulting services from Ludmila Smolyansky, a member of the Company's Board of Directors and former Chairperson of its Board of Directors. On
December 28, 2020, Lifeway entered into an amended and restated consulting agreement (the "Agreement"), effective as of December 31, 2020, with Ms. Smolyansky.
Under the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Ms. Smolyansky will continue to provide consulting services with respect to, among other things, the Company's
business strategy, international expansion and product management and expansion. For the services, the Company will pay an annual service fee of $500, and Ms.
Smolyansky will also be eligible for an annual performance fee target of $500 based on the achievement of specified performance criteria. The annual service fee and
target bonus amounts are subject to periodic change by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors on 30 days' prior written notice to the
Chairperson. The Agreement shall continue until either party provides at least a 10-day written notice of termination.

On January 4, 2022, the Company notified Ms. Smolyansky that it was terminating the Agreement effective January 17, 2022. Service fees earned are included in
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were $22 and $500 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

Board of Directors and former Chairperson of its Board of Directors (the "Endorsement Agreement") under which it pays the Chairperson a royalty based on the sale of
certain Lifeway products, not to exceed $50 in any fiscal month.

Note 15 - Business Acquisition

On August 18, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Glen Oaks Farms Inc. for a purchase price of $5,800 in cash. Glen Oaks is engaged in
the manufacture, development, and sale of probiotic drinkable yogurt. The acquisition of Glen Oaks Farms initiates Lifeway's expansion outside of kefir and into

F-25

Management considers the purchase of Glen Oaks Farms Inc. to consist of inputs, processes and outputs and has accounted for the purchase as a business combination.
The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of operations were included in the Company's consolidated statement of
operations from the date of acquisition. Included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations are the acquisition's net sales of $2,223 and income before
income taxes of approximately $384 from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2021. The Company incurred approximately $83 in acquisition-related costs
which are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Pro-forma results of operation have not
been presented as the effect would not be material to the Company's results of operations for any periods presented.

The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed:

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>$</th></tr>
<tr><td>Customer relationships</td><td>2,400</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brand name</td><td>2,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Goodwill</td><td>1,400</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assets acquired</td><td>5,800</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liabilities assumed</td><td>-</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total purchase price</td><td>5,800</td></tr>
</table>

The fair value for the customer relationships at the acquisition date were determined using the excess earnings method under the income approach. The brand name fair
value was determined using the relief from royalty method. The customer relationship and brand name intangible assets have an estimated life of 15 years and will be
amortized over that period. The fair value measurements of intangible assets are based on significant unobservable inputs, and thus represent Level 3 inputs. Significant
assumptions used in assessing the fair values of intangible assets include discounted future cash flows, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates. Goodwill arises
principally from category expansion opportunities to better serve its regional and national customers. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition is tax deductible.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure material information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that a control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have
been detected.

As of December 31, 2022 (the "Evaluation Date"), we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "Exchange Act")). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified under the Exchange Act rules.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is identified in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal
accounting officer, and effected by the Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

*   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;

*   provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and

*   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the level of compliance with related policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
("COSO") in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2022.
Remediation of the Material Weakness
During 2022, management evaluated our policies and procedures related to accounting for deferred income taxes and goodwill of acquired intangible assets. We have
implemented controls to ensure that (i) the goodwill allocation associated with any acquired intangible assets are properly accounted for and disclosed in the period of
acquisition, and (ii) the deferred income tax effects of acquired intangible assets are properly accounted for and disclosed in the period of acquisition.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 2022 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
