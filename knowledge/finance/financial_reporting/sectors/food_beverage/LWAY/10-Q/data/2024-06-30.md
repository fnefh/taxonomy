The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information, and do not include certain information and footnote disclosures required for complete, audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of all interim periods reported herein. The consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.

## Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and all its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively "Lifeway" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

## Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies, which are summarized in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, have not materially changed. The following is a description of certain of our significant accounting policies.

## Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based and incentive compensation, and deferred income taxes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Lifeway considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates or equals fair value due to their short-term nature.

Lifeway from time to time may have bank deposits in excess of insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. Lifeway has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal.

## Advertising and promotional costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported in Selling expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Total advertising expense was $2,531 and $2,006 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total advertising expense was $1,159 and $543 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

7

## Segments

The Company is managed as a single reportable segment. The Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and assessing financial performance, as well as for making strategic operational decisions and managing the organization. Substantially all of Lifeway's consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that it produces using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.

## Recent accounting pronouncements

## Issued but not yet effective

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance requires entities to report incremental information about significant segment expenses included in a segment's profit or loss measure as well as the name and title of the chief operating decision maker. The guidance also requires interim disclosures related to reportable segment profit or loss and assets that had previously only been disclosed annually. The new standard is effective for our annual period ending December 31, 2024 and our interim periods during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The guidance does not affect recognition or measurement in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that requires entities to disclose additional information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new standard also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The guidance does not affect recognition or measurement in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

| Less current portion                                     | -               | (1,250 )            |
| Total long-term portion                                  | $ -             | $ 1,483             |

The Company paid the outstanding term loan balance of $2,250 in full during the second quarter of 2024 and expensed the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs.

## Credit Agreement

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended and modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with its existing lender and certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a $5 million term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments of principal and interest over a term of five years, a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $5 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and an incremental facility not to exceed $5 million. The termination date of the term loan is August 18, 2026, unless earlier terminated. The termination date of the revolving credit facility isJune 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated.

All outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at theSecured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 2.07%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused revolving line of credit fee of0.20% and, in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of credit, a letter of credit fee of 0.20%.

The Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00, and a minimum working capital financial covenant, as defined, of no less than $11.25 million, in each of the fiscal quarters ending through the expiration date. The Credit Agreement provides for events of default, including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement, as a result of which amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The loans and all other amounts due and owed under the Credit Agreement and related documents are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.

Lifeway was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum working capital covenants at June 30, 2024.

## Revolving Credit Facility

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had $5,000 available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024.

10

## Note 8 - Leases

The Company leases certain machinery and equipment with fixed base rent payments and variable costs based on usage. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than one year to six years. The Company includes lease extension options, if applicable and reasonably certain to be exercised, in the calculation of the rightof-use asset and lease liabilities. Lifeway includes only fixed payments for lease components in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Variable lease payments are those that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. There are no residual value guarantees. Lifeway does not currently have leases which meet the finance lease classification as defined under ASC 842.

Lifeway treats contracts as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, it directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset.

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Lifeway has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components into a single component for all of its leases. When the Company is unable to determine an implicit interest rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases. Lifeway includes options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. Expense for these short-term leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease expense was $77 and $61 (including short term leases) for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total lease expense was $42 and $30 (including short term leases) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:

| Year                               | Operating Leases   |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Six months ended December 31, 2024 | $ 42               |
| 2025                               | 55                 |
| 2026                               | 31                 |
| 2027                               | 21                 |
| 2028                               | 17                 |
| Thereafter                         | 10                 |
| Total lease payments               | 176                |
| Less: Interest                     | (22 )              |
| Present value of lease liabilities | $ 154              |

The weighted-average remaining lease term for its operating leases was3.4 years as of June 30, 2024. The weighted average discount rate of its operating leases was 9.25% as of June 30, 2024. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $46 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $22 and $21 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Note 9 - Commitments and contingencies

Lifeway is involved in various legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters, audits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of, or incidental, to the Company's business, including commercial disputes, product liabilities, intellectual property matters and employment-related matters.

11

Lifeway records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a periodic basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, it does not establish an accrued liability. Currently, none of its accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial position and it is management's opinion that the ultimate resolution of these outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, if the Company is ultimately required to make payments in connection with an adverse outcome, it is possible that such contingency could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

## Note 10 - Income taxes

Income taxes were recognized at effective rates of30.0% and 33.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income taxes were recognized at effective rates of 29.4% and 32.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company calculates the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year, excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items, and applies that rate to income (loss) before provision for income taxes for the period.

The Company's effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2024, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.

Unrecognized tax benefits were $0 at June 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not expect material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

## Note 11 - Stock-based and Other Compensation

## Omnibus Incentive Plan

In December 2015, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of3.5 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units to qualifying employees. Under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives, generally in the form of restricted stock or performance shares. The number of performance shares that participants may earn depends on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Stock awards generally vest over a three-year performance or service period. At June 30, 2024, no shares remain available for award under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan as it was terminated on August 31, 2022. However, any outstanding awards under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan are unaffected by the termination of the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan or by the approval of the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2022 Plan") as described below.

On August 31, 2022, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2022 Plan. Under the 2022 Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant awards of various types of compensation, including, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The maximum number of shares authorized to be awarded under the 2022 Plan is 3.25 million shares of common stock, which includes shares that remained available under the now terminated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

12

Awards granted under the 2022 Plan are generally subject to a minimum vesting period of at least one year. Awards may be subject to cliff-vesting or graded-vesting conditions, with graded vesting starting no earlier than one year after the grant date. The Plan Administrator may provide for shorter vesting periods in an award agreement for no more than five percent of the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2022 Plan. As of June 30, 2024, 2.64 million shares remain available to award under the 2022 Plan.

## Restricted Stock Units

A Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") represents the right to receive one share of common stock in the future. RSUs have no exercise price. The grant date fair value of the awards is determined by the Company's closing stock price on the grant date. Lifeway expenses RSUs over the vesting period. The following table summarizes RSU activity during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results. The Company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only at the date made. Except as otherwise required to be disclosed in periodic reports required to be filed by public companies with the SEC pursuant to the SEC's rules, Lifeway has no duty to update these statements, and it undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

## Business Overview

Lifeway was founded in 1986 by Michael Smolyansky, ten years after he and his family emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States. Lifeway was the first to successfully introduce kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, "better for you" foods.

## Trends and Uncertainties

Current Macroeconomic Environment and Inflation Impact

Since 2022, we experienced inflationary and cost pressures due to volatility and disruption in the global economy which have increased our production and distribution costs. We experienced some moderation of inflationary pressures and pricing declines in certain of our input costs, such as milk, during 2023. We expect overall inflationary pressures to be moderate during 2024.

We have not experienced significant supply chain disruptions or labor supply shortages and have continued to satisfy customer and consumer demand for our products. Management continues to proactively manage the supply and transportation of materials used to produce and package our products, staffing, and transportation of our products to customers. This proactive planning has allowed the Company to meet increased demand.

## Net Sales

Net sales were $49,157 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $9,927 or 25.3% versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher volumes of our branded drinkable kefir.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.0% and 28.7% in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease versus the prior year was primarily due to unfavorable milk pricing.

## Selling Expense

Selling expenses increased by $1,006 to $3,577 during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 from $2,571 during the same period in 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 7.3% in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 from 6.6% during the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by our continued investments in marketing activities.

## General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expenses increased $369 to $4,177 during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 from $3,808 during the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.5% in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 from 9.7% during the same period in 2023.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $1,576 and $1,529 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 29.4% compared to 32.6% in the same period last year. The statutory Federal and state tax rates remained consistent from 2024 to 2023. The Company has items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2023, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.

The Company's effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur.

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net sales were at $93,791 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $16,657 or 21.6% versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher volumes of our branded drinkable kefir.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 26.4% and 25.3% during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase versus the prior year was primarily due to the higher volumes of our branded products, which provided manufacturing efficiencies and favorable fixed cost absorption.

## Selling Expense

Selling expense increased by $1,187 to $7,277 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 from $6,090 during the same period in 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 7.8% in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 from 7.9% during the same period in 2023.

## General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased $1,370 to $8,313 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 from $6,943 during the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by stock-based incentive compensation and non-routine stockholder action expense.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $2,658 and $2,037 during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 30.0% compared to 33.8% in the same period last year. The statutory Federal and state tax

rates remained consistent from 2024 to 2023. The Company has items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2023, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.

The Company's effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur.

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, and while it has been impacted by the macroeconomic challenges with commodity inflation and other input cost increases, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations, revolving credit, and cash and cash equivalents will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for its working capital needs, capital resource requirements, and growth initiatives and to ensure the continuation of the Company as a going concern.

If additional borrowings are needed, $5,000 was available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024 (see Note 7, Debt). We are in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and expect to meet foreseeable financial requirements. The success of our business and financing strategies will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to take advantage of various opportunities as they arise. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and obtaining financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, and income tax liabilities) as well as expenditures for property, plant and equipment.

Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding deferred income taxes (see Note 10, Income Taxes, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K).

## Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $8,090 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $5,455 in the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher cash earnings driven by increased product volumes.

## Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $3,905 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to $1,950 in the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used reflects our planned capital spending increase during 2024 compared to 2023. Our capital spending is focused in three core areas: growth, cost reduction, and facility improvements. Growth capital spending supports capacity expansion and new product innovation and enhancements. Cost reduction and facility improvements support manufacturing efficiency, safety, and productivity. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support productivity initiatives.

## Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $2,750 and $500 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used represents the quarterly principal payments under the term loan. The Company paid the outstanding term loan balance of $2,250 in full during the second quarter of 2024.

## Debt Obligations

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended and modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with its existing lender and certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a $5 million term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments of principal and interest over a term of five years, a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $5 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and an incremental facility not to exceed $5 million. The termination date of the term loan is August 18, 2026, unless earlier terminated. The term loan was terminated during the second quarter of 2024 upon payment of the outstanding loan balance in full. The termination date of the revolving credit facility is June 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and note payable. The Company had $5,000 available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024.

All outstanding amounts under the loans bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 2.07%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused line fee of 0.20% on the Revolving Credit Facility, and in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of credit, a letter of credit fee of 0.20%.

The Company is in compliance with all applicable financial debt covenants as of June 30, 2024. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness and related agreements.
