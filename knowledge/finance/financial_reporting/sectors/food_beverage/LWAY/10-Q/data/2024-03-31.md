## LIFEWAY FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

(In thousands, except per share data)

## Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information, and do not include certain information and footnote disclosures required for complete, audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of all interim periods reported herein. The consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.

## Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lifeway Foods, Inc. and all its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively "Lifeway" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

## Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies, which are summarized in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, have not materially changed. The following is a description of certain of our significant accounting policies.

## Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based and incentive compensation, and deferred income taxes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Lifeway considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates or equals fair value due to their short-term nature.

Lifeway from time to time may have bank deposits in excess of insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. Lifeway has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal.

7

## Advertising and promotional costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported in Selling expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Total advertising expense was $1,372 and $1,463 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Segments

The Company is managed as a single reportable segment. The Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and assessing financial performance, as well as for making strategic operational decisions and managing the organization. Substantially all of Lifeway's consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that it produces using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.

## Recent accounting pronouncements

## Issued but not yet effective

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance requires entities to report incremental information about significant segment expenses included in a segment's profit or loss measure as well as the name and title of the chief operating decision maker. The guidance also requires interim disclosures related to reportable segment profit or loss and assets that had previously only been disclosed annually. The new standard is effective for our annual period ending December 31, 2024 and our interim periods during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The guidance does not affect recognition or measurement in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that requires entities to disclose additional information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new standard also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The guidance does not affect recognition or measurement in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## Total term loan

$

2,500

## Credit Agreement

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended and modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with its existing lender and certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a $5 million term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments of principal and interest over a term of five years, a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $5 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and an incremental facility not to exceed $5 million. The termination date of the term loan is August 18, 2026, unless earlier terminated. The termination date of the revolving credit facility isJune 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated.

All outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at theSecured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 2.07%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused revolving line of credit fee of0.20% and, in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of credit, a letter of credit fee of 0.20%.

The Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00, and a minimum working capital financial covenant, as defined, of no less than $11.25 million, in each of the fiscal quarters ending through the expiration date. The Credit Agreement continues to provide for events of default, including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement, as a result of which amounts due under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The loans and all other amounts due and owed under the Credit Agreement and related documents are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.

Lifeway was in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum working capital covenants at March 31, 2024.

11

## Revolving Credit Facility

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had $5,000 available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024.

## Note 8 - Leases

The Company leases certain machinery and equipment with fixed base rent payments and variable costs based on usage. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than one year to six years. The Company includes lease extension options, if applicable and reasonably certain to be exercised, in the calculation of the rightof-use asset and lease liabilities. Lifeway includes only fixed payments for lease components in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Variable lease payments are those that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. There are no residual value guarantees. Lifeway does not currently have leases which meet the finance lease classification as defined under ASC 842.

Lifeway treats contracts as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, it directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset.

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Lifeway has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components into a single component for all of its leases. When the Company is unable to determine an implicit interest rate, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases. Lifeway includes options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. Expense for these short-term leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease expense was $35 and $31 (including short term leases) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:

| Year                                | Operating Leases   |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Nine months ended December 31, 2024 | $ 64               |
| 2025                                | 55                 |
| 2026                                | 31                 |
| 2027                                | 21                 |
| 2028                                | 17                 |
| Thereafter                          | 10                 |
| Total lease payments                | 198                |
| Less: Interest                      | (26 )              |
| Present value of lease liabilities  | $ 172              |

The weighted-average remaining lease term for its operating leases was3.5 years as of March 31, 2024. The weighted average discount rate of its operating leases was 9.49% as of March 31, 2024. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $24 and $25 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Note 9 - Commitments and contingencies

Litigation

Lifeway is involved in various legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters, audits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of, or incidental, to the Company's business, including commercial disputes, product liabilities, intellectual property matters and employment-related matters.

Lifeway records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a periodic basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, it does not establish an accrued liability. Currently, none of its accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial position and it is management's opinion that the ultimate resolution of these outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, if the Company is ultimately required to make payments in connection with an adverse outcome, it is possible that such contingency could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

## Note 10 - Income taxes

Income taxes were recognized at effective rates of30.8% and 37.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company calculates the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year, excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items, and applies that rate to income (loss) before provision for income taxes for the period.

The Company's effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2024, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.

Unrecognized tax benefits were $0 at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not expect material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

## Note 11 - Stock-based and Other Compensation

## Omnibus Incentive Plan

In December 2015, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of3.5 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units to qualifying employees. Under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives, generally in the form of restricted stock or performance shares. The number of performance shares that participants may earn depends on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Stock awards generally vest over a three-year performance or service period. At March 31, 2024, no shares remain available for award under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan as it was terminated on August 31, 2022. However, any outstanding awards under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan are unaffected by the termination of the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan or by the approval of the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2022 Plan") as described below.

On August 31, 2022, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2022 Plan. Under the 2022 Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant awards of various types of compensation, including, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The maximum number of shares authorized to be awarded under the 2022 Plan is 3.25 million shares of common stock, which includes shares that remained available under the now terminated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Awards granted under the 2022 Plan are generally subject to a minimum vesting period of at least one year. Awards may be subject to cliff-vesting or graded-vesting conditions, with graded vesting starting no earlier than one year after the grant date. The Plan Administrator may provide for shorter vesting periods in an award agreement for no more than five percent of the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2022 Plan. As of March 31, 2024, 2.64 million shares remain available to award under the 2022 Plan.

## Restricted Stock Units

A Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") represents the right to receive one share of common stock in the future. RSUs have no exercise price. The grant date fair value of the awards is determined by the Company's closing stock price on the grant date. Lifeway expenses RSUs over the vesting period. The following table summarizes RSU activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

|                                       | Restricted Stock Units (In thousands)   | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value   |

## Long-Term Incentive Plan Compensation

Lifeway has established long-term incentive-based compensation programs for certain senior executives and key employees pursuant to the terms of its incentive plans.

## 2020 CEO Incentive Award

During the fourth quarter 2020, Lifeway awarded a long-term equity-based incentive of $750 to its Chief Executive Officer (the "2020 CEO Award") depending on Lifeway's 2020 performance levels compared to the respective targets. The equity-based incentive compensation is payable in restricted stock that vests one-third in April 2022, one-third in April 2023, and one-third in April 2024. The issuance of vested equity awards is subject to approval under the Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 1, 1999. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, $18 and $43 was expensed as stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the total remaining unearned compensation of $6 will be recognized in 2024, subject to vesting.

## 2021 Equity Award

## Non-Employee Director Plan

On August 31, 2022, Lifeway stockholders approved the 2022 Non-Employee Director Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2022 Director Plan"), which authorizes the grant of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which will vest on such schedule as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Each non-employee director of the Company is eligible to be a participant in the 2022 Director Plan until they no longer serve as a non-employee director. As of the date of each annual shareholder meeting, the Company may grant each director a number of RSUs for such year and set the vesting schedule for the RSUs granted. Whether and how many RSUs the Company will grant to directors in any year is subject to the sole discretion of the Company and shall in any event be subject to the 2022 Director Plan's overall share limits. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2022 Director Plan is 500 thousand shares. As of March 31, 2024, 430 thousand shares remain available to award under the 2022 Director Plan. The aggregate fair market value of shares underlying RSU compensation that may be issued as RSU compensation to a director in any year shall not exceed $170. In addition to the grant of RSUs, the 2022 Director Plan also provides for the deferral by electing participants of all or part of their cash compensation (in 10% increments) into a deferred cash account, and they may defer all or part of their cash and/or RSU compensation (in 10% increments) into a deferred RSU account. Deferred benefits are paid in a lump sum upon the applicable director's departure from the Board of Directors.

## Retirement Benefits

Lifeway has a defined contribution plan which is available to substantially all full-time employees. Under the terms of the plan, the Company matches employee contributions under a prescribed formula. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, total contribution expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations was $193 and $150, respectively.

## Business Overview

Lifeway was founded in 1986 by Michael Smolyansky, ten years after he and his family emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States. Lifeway was the first to successfully introduce kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, "better for you" foods.

Our primary product is drinkable kefir, a cultured dairy product. Lifeway Kefir is tart and tangy, high in protein, calcium and vitamin D. The Company manufactures (directly or through a co-manufacturer) and markets products under the Lifeway, Fresh Made, and GlenOaks Farms brand names, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers.

## The Company's product categories are:

- · Drinkable Kefir, a cultured dairy product sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types.
- · European-style soft cheeses, including farmer cheese, white cheese, and Sweet Kiss.
- · Cream and other, which primarily consists of cream, a byproduct of raw milk processing.

## Recent Developments

Current Macroeconomic Environment and Inflation Impact

Since 2022, we experienced inflationary and cost pressures due to volatility and disruption in the global economy which have increased our production and distribution costs. We have begun to see some moderation of inflationary pressures and have experienced pricing declines in certain of our input costs, such as milk, during 2023. We expect inflationary pressures to be moderate during 2024.

We have not experienced significant supply chain disruptions or labor supply shortages and have continued to satisfy customer and consumer demand for our products. Management continues to proactively manage the supply and transportation of materials used to make and package our products, staffing, and transportation of our products to customers. This proactive planning has allowed the Company to meet increased demand.

## Net Sales

Net sales were at $44,634 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $6,731 or 17.8% versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher volumes of our branded drinkable kefir.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.8% during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. Gross profit percentage was 21.7% in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase versus the prior year was primarily due to the higher volumes of our branded products, and to a lesser extent a favorable impact to transportation costs.

## Selling Expenses

Selling expenses increased by $181 to $3,700 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 from $3,519 during the same period in 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.3% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 from 9.3% during the same period in 2023.

21

## General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased $1,001 to $4,136 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 from $3,135 during the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by incentive compensation and non-routine stockholder action expense.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $1,082 and $508 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 30.8% compared to 37.9% in the same period last year. The statutory Federal and state tax rates remained consistent from 2024 to 2023. The Company has items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2023, the percentage effect is different due to the difference in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023.

The Company's effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur.

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, and while it has been impacted by the macroeconomic challenges with commodity inflation and other input cost increases, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations, revolving credit and term loan facility, and cash and cash equivalents will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for its

working capital needs, capital resource requirements, and growth initiatives and to ensure the continuation of the Company as a going concern.

If additional borrowings are needed, $5,000 was available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024 (see Note 7, Debt). We are in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and expect to meet foreseeable financial requirements. The success of our business and financing strategies will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to take advantage of various opportunities as they arise. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and obtaining financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, and income tax liabilities) as well as expenditures for property, plant and equipment.

Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (see Note 7, Debt) and deferred income taxes (see Note 10, Income Taxes, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K).

## Cash Flow

The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:

|                                       | Three months Ended March 31,   | Three months Ended March 31,   |

| Financing activities                  | $ (250 )                       | (500 )                         |

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,546 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 compared to $3,027 in the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the change in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings driven by increased product volumes and declines in certain input costs.

## Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $2,469 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 compared to $1,762 in the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used reflects our planned capital spending increase during 2024 compared to 2023. Our capital spending is focused in three core areas: growth, cost reduction, and facility improvements. Growth capital spending supports capacity expansion and new product innovation and enhancements. Cost reduction and facility improvements support manufacturing efficiency, safety, and productivity.

## Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $250 and $500 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used represents the quarterly principal payments under the term loan.

## Debt Obligations

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended and modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with its existing lender and certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a $5 million term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments of principal and interest over a term of five years, a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $5 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and an incremental facility not to exceed $5 million. The termination date of the term loan is August 18, 2026, unless earlier terminated. The termination date of the revolving credit facility is June 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $2,485 outstanding under the note payable, net of $15 of unamortized deferred financing fees. The Company had $5,000 available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024.

All outstanding amounts under the loans bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 2.07%. The Company's interest rate on debt outstanding under the note payable as of March 31, 2024 was 7.39%. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused line fee of 0.20% on the Revolving Credit Facility, and in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of credit, a letter of credit fee of 0.20%.

23

The Company is in compliance with all applicable financial debt covenants as of March 31, 2024. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness and related agreements.
