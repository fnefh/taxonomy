Such statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.

## THE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

(Amounts in thousands, except par values and per share data)

## 1. BUSINESS

The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company," "Hain Celestial," "we," "us" or "our"), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey. The Company's mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer, and seller of organic and natural, "better-for-you" products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug, and convenience stores worldwide. The Company operates under two reportable segments: North America and International.

## 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliated companies in which the Company exerts significant influence, but which it does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As such, consolidated net (loss) income includes the Company's equity in the current losses or earnings of such companies.

The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 (the "Form 10-K"). The amounts as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2023 are derived from the Company's audited annual financial statements. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which, in management's opinion, are necessary for a fair presentation for interim periods. Operating results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Please refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2023 and for the fiscal year then ended included in the Form 10-K for information not included in these condensed notes.

All amounts in the unaudited consolidated financial statements, notes and tables have been rounded to the nearest thousands, except par values and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated.

## Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

## Significant Accounting Policies

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K. Included herein are certain updates to those policies.

## Transfer of Financial Assets

The Company accounts for transfers of financial assets, such as non-recourse accounts receivable financing arrangements, when the Company has surrendered control over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred requires an evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred and any other relevant considerations. The Company has non-recourse financing arrangements in which eligible receivables are sold to third-party buyers in exchange for cash. The Company transferred accounts receivable in their entirety to the buyers and satisfied all of the conditions to report the transfer of financial assets in their entirety as a sale. The principal amount of receivables sold under these arrangements was $223,600 and $290,856 during the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, re spectively. The incremental cost of financing receivables u nder these arrangements is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The proceeds from the sale of receivables are included in cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

## Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-03, " Presentation of Financial Statement (Topic 205), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ", to amend various SEC paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") to reflect the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, among other things.

## 7. LEASES

The Company leases office space, warehouse and distribution facilities, manufacturing equipment and vehicles primarily in North America and Western Europe. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company's lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Some of the Company's leases contain variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred unless those payments are based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at lease commencement and included in the measurement of the lease liability; thereafter, changes to lease payments due to rate or index changes are recorded as variable lease expense in the period incurred. The Company does not have any related party leases, and sublease transactions are de minimis.

The components of lease expenses for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

## 8. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

## Goodwill

The following table provides changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment:

Table of Contents

|                              | North America   | International   | Total     |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Balance as of June 30, 2023  | $ 697,053       | $ 241,587       | $ 938,640 |
| Translation                  | (896)           | (1,609)         | (2,505)   |
| Balance as of March 31, 2024 | $ 696,157       | $ 239,978       | $ 936,135 |

As a result of the significant decline in the Company's market capitalization and the same factors triggering the interim impairment tests for the ParmCrisps and Thinsters trademarks, certain North America personal care tradenames, and other intangible assets discussed below, the Company completed an interim impairment test of all reporting units. For United Kingdom, Western Europe, Canada, and Ella's Kitchen UK, the Company performed a qualitative evaluation to assess factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company concluded that the qualitatively tested reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying amounts. Three of these reporting units (United Kingdom, Western Europe and Canada) were quantitatively tested in fiscal 2023 and as of the last quantitative testing date, their estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying amounts by more than 17.7%. ® ®

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed an interim quantitative impairment test of goodwill in the United States ("U.S.") reporting unit and concluded that the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated utilizing a blended approach which included an income approach utilizing the Discounted Cash Flows ("DCF") Method and the Guideline Public Company Methodology ("GPCM"), a market-based approach.

At March 31, 2024, the goodwill related to the U.S. reporting unit is at risk of potential impairment if the fair value of this reporting unit, and its associated assets, decrease in value due to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, decreased customer demand for products, an inability to execute management's business strategies, or general market conditions, such as economic downturns, and changes in interest rates, including discount rates. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective, and actual results may differ materially from the Company's estimates. If the Company's ongoing cash flow projections are not met or if market factors utilized in the impairment test deteriorate, including an unfavorable change in the terminal growth rate or the weighted-average cost of capital, the Company may have to record impairment charges in future periods. As of March 31, 2024 the U.S. reporting unit had $647,321 of goodwill and the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 5.2%.

## Other Intangible Assets

The following table includes the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization, where applicable, for intangible assets, excluding goodwill:

|                                  | March 31, 2024   | June 30, 2023   |
|----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Non-amortized intangible assets: |                  |                 |
| Trademarks and tradenames (1)    | $ 224,788        | $ 250,860       |
| Amortized intangible assets:     |                  |                 |
| Other intangibles                | 144,294          | 161,874         |
| Less: Accumulated amortization   | (118,817)        | (114,629)       |
| Net amortized intangible assets  | 25,477           | 47,245          |
| Net other intangible assets      | $ 250,265        | $ 298,105       |

The gross carrying amount of trademarks and tradenames is reflected net of $249,291 and $223,981 of accumulated impairment charges as of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. (1)

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $10,797 related to Thinsters indefinite and definite lived intangible assets in connection with the probable sale of its Thinsters cookie business (see Note 20, Subsequent Event) . The Company concluded that as of March 31, 2024, there was a high probability that the sale of the Thinsters business would occur and therefore, a quantitative impairment test was performed. To determine the amount of the impairment, the Company compared the carrying amount of the Thinsters assets to its estimated fair value (which was the expected selling price less transaction costs). Further, the Company determined that not all criteria were met to be able to classify the Thinsters business as held for sale as of March 31, 2024, since the Company did not receive approval from its Board of Directors to sell the Thinsters business ® ® ® ® ® ®

until after March 31, 2024. The assets are part of the North America reportable segment and have a remaining aggregate carrying amount of $2,023 as of March 31, 2024.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of further expected decline in the actual and projected performance and cash flows of certain North America personal care brands (namely, Alba Botanica , Avalon Organics , and JASON ) and the ParmCrisps brand, the Company determined that interim impairment tests of the associated indefinite-lived trademarks were required to be performed. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $12,815 and $8,000 for the personal care tradenames and the ParmCrisps trademark, respectively, to reduce the carrying amounts of such intangible assets to their estimated fair values of $13,000 and nil, respectively. The fair value was determined using the relief from royalty method, and impairment charges were recorded within intangibles and long-lived asset impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The assets are part of the North America reportable segment. ® ® ® ® ®

As a result of the same factors triggering the interim impairment tests for the ParmCrisps trademark discussed above, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed its interim impairment tests of the ParmCrisps asset group, which was primarily comprised of amortizable customer relationships, machinery and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the ParmCrisps asset group exceeded the estimated fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $10,586 to reduce the carrying amount of the ParmCrisps customer relationships, to their estimated fair value which was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment charges were recorded within intangibles and long-lived asset impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The customer relationship intangible asset was part of the North America reportable segment and was fully impaired as of March 31, 2024. ® ® ® ®

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recordednon-cash impairment charges of $102,000 and $8,500 for the ParmCrisps and Thinsters trademarks, respectively, to reduce the carrying amount of such intangible assets to their estimated fair value. The fair values were determined using the relief from royalty method, and impairment charges were recorded within intangibles and long-lived asset impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The assets are part of the North America reportable segment and fully impaired as of March 31, 2024. As a result of the same factors triggering the interim impairment tests for the ParmCrisps and Thinsters trademarks, the Company completed interim impairment tests of the ParmCrisps and Thinsters asset groups, which were primarily comprised of amortizable customer relationships. The Company determined that the ParmCrisps asset group's carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $45,798 to reduce the carrying amount of the ParmCrisps customer relationships, the primary asset in the asset group, to their estimated fair value. Impairment charges were recorded within intangibles and long-lived asset impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the Thinsters asset group exceeded its carrying amount. The assets had a remaining aggregate carrying amount of $19,889 as of June 30, 2023. ® ® ® ® ® ® ® ® ®

Amortized intangible assets, which are deemed to have a finite life, primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 7 to 25 years.

Amortization expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:

On August 22, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the Credit Agreement (as amended by a First Amendment dated December 16, 2022, the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $ 1,100 million in the aggregate, consisting of (1) $300 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the "Term Loans") and (2) an $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit, and is comprised of a $440 million U.S. revolving credit facility and $360 million global revolving credit facility) (the "Revolver"). Both the Revolver and the Term Loans mature on December 22, 2026. Th e Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the Company and are secured by liens on assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries, including the equity interest in each of their direct subsidiaries and intellectual property, subject to agreed-upon exceptions.

The Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require compliance with a consolidated secured leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company's maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio was amended to be 5.00:1.00 until September 30, 2023, 5.25:1.00 until December 31, 2023 and5.00:1.00 until December 31, 2024 (the period of time during which such maximum consolidated secured leverage ratios are in effect, the "Second Amendment Period," which the Company may elect to end early). Following the Second Amendment Period, the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio will be 4.25:1.00, subject to possible temporary increase following certain corporate acquisitions. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company 's maximum consolidated leverage ratio is 6.00:1.00. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company's minimum interest coverage ratio was amended to be 2.50:1.00.

During the Second Amendment Period, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) Term SOFR plus2.5% per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus 1.5% per annum. Following the Second Amendment Period, Loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) Term SOFR plus a rate ranging from 1.125% to 2.0% per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus a rate ranging from 0.125% to 1.0% per annum, the relevant rate in each case being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate following the Second Amendment Period will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement as amended by the Second Amendment. Excluding hedge impact, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2024 was 8.10%. During fiscal 2021, the Company used interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related its outstanding variable rate debt. As of March 31, 2024, the notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $400,000 with fixed rate payments of 5.60%. Including hedge impact, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2024 was 6.96%. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the amount unused under the Credit Agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid.

As of March 31, 2024, there were $496,000 of loans under the Revolver, $283,125 of Term Loans, and $3,188 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2024, $300,812 was available under the Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with the financial covenants. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all associated covenants.

## Credit Agreement Issuance Costs

In connection with the First Amendment to its Credit Agreement during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $1,987, of which $1,916 was deferred. Of the total deferred costs, $1,396 were associated with the Revolver and are being amortized on a straight-line basis within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $520 are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the Term Loans as a component of Interest and other financing expense, net over the term of the Credit Agreement.

In connection with the Second Amendment to its Credit Agreement during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $3,854, of which $3,813 was deferred. Of the total deferred costs, $2,802 were associated with the Revolver and are being amortized on a straight-line basis within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $1,011 are being recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the Term Loans as a component of Interest and other financing expense, net over the term of the Credit Agreement utilizing the effective interest rate method.

Interest paid during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 was $12,666 and $40,054, respectively. Interest paid during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 was $11,791 and $27,857, respectively.

## 10. INCOME TAXES

In general, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, to determine its quarterly provision for income taxes. The Company calculated its tax rate on a discrete basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 due to significant variations in the relationship between tax expense and projected pretax income. Certain significant or unusual items are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability on the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. The Company's effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.

The effective income tax rate was an expense of12.1% and a benefit of 25.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 6.1% and 24.1% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 was impacted by an increase in the federal and state valuation allowance, tax expense related to stock-based compensation, global intangible low-taxed income and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was impacted by ParmCrisps and Thinsters trademarks and ParmCrisps asset group impairment charges, gain on the sale of Westbrae, an operating lease modification during the second quarter, severance with respect to our former CEO (as part of the limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation), stock-based compensation and changes in uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rates in each period were also impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and state income taxes. ® ® ®

## 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE PLANS

Under the Company' s Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the "2002 Plan"), the Company historically granted equity-based awards to its officers, senior management, other key employees, consultants, and directors. The Company currently utilizes a stockholder-approved plan, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. 2022 Long Term Incentive and Stock Award Plan (the "2022 Plan"), which was approved at the Company's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on November 17, 2022. The 2022 Plan permits the Company to continue making equity-based and other incentive awards in a manner intended to properly incentivize its employees, directors, consultants and other service providers by aligning their interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders. The Company also historically granted shares under its 2019 Equity Inducement Award Program (the "2019 Inducement Program") to induce selected individuals to become employees of the Company. The 2002 Plan, the 2022 Plan and the 2019 Inducement Program are collectively referred to as the "Stock Award Plans." In conjunction with the Stock Award Plans, the Company maintains a long-term incentive program (the "LTI Program" or "LTIP") that provides for equity awards, including performance and market-based equity awards that can be earned over defined performance periods. The Company's LTIP plans, with the exception of the 2023 - 2025 LTIP described below, are described in Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K.

Compensation cost and related income tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation plans were as follows:

## Restricted Stock

Awards of restricted stock are either restricted stock awards ("RSAs") or restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are issued at no cost to the recipient. Performance-based or market-based RSUs are issued in the form of performance share units ("PSUs").

## 2024-2026 LTIP

During the nine months ended March 31, 2024, the Company granted market-based PSU awards under the LTIP with a total target payout of 596 shares of common stock. At March 31, 2024, there were573 such shares outstanding under the LTIP. Such PSU awards will vest, if at all, pursuant to a defined calculation of either relative TSR or absolute TSR (as defined) over the period from October 26, 2023 through the earlier of (i) October 25, 2026; (ii) the date the participant's employment is terminated due to death or Disability (as defined); or (iii) the effective date of a Change in Control (as defined) (the "2024 TSR Performance Period"). Vesting of 382 target shares of the outstanding PSU awards is pursuant to a defined calculation of relative TSR over the 2024 TSR Performance Period (the "2024 Relative TSR PSUs"). Vesting of 191 target shares of the outstanding PSU awards is pursuant to the achievement of pre-established three-year compound annual TSR targets over the 2024 TSR Performance Period (the "2024 Absolute TSR PSUs"). Total shares eligible to vest for both the 2024 Relative TSR PSUs and 2024 Absolute TSR PSUs range from zero to 200% of the target amount. Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model with grant date fair values per target share and related valuation assumptions as follows:

## 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are required to be grouped in one of three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These levels are:

- · Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
- · Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
- · Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024:

There were no transfers of financial instruments between the three levels of fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.

## Table of Contents

## Derivative Instruments

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk and cross-currency swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the Company's nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of the Company's derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to its derivative contracts, which determination was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, all of the derivatives held as of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

## Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

The Company measures certain non-financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment and right-of-use lease assets. These assets were initially measured and recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined as of the date of acquisition or purchase subject to changes in value only for foreign currency translation. Periodically, these assets are tested for impairment by comparing their respective carrying amounts to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or asset group in which they reside. In the event any of these assets were to become impaired, the Company would recognize an impairment expense equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impaired asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. For indefinitelived intangible assets, the relief from royalty approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. Fair value measurements of reporting units are estimated using an income approach involving discounted cash flow models that contain certain Level 3 inputs requiring significant management judgment, including projections of economic conditions, customer demand and changes in competition, revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Fair value measurements of the reporting units associated with the Company's goodwill balances and its indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for purposes of impairment testing if a quantitative analysis is performed.

## 15. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

## Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's receivables and borrowings.

Certain of the Company's foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company's cash receipts and payments in terms of the Company's functional currency. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain assets and liabilities in terms of its functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

## Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCL related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable rate debt. During the remaining three months of fiscal 2024, the Company estimates that an additional $2,266 will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

Table of Contents

| Interest Rate Derivative   |   Number of Instruments | Notional Amount   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Interest Rate Swap         |                       4 | $400,000          |

## Cash Flow Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivatives including cross-currency swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-EUR exchange rates. Cross-currency swaps involve exchanging fixed-rate interest payments for fixed-rate interest receipts, both of which will occur at the USD-EUR forward exchange rates in effect upon entering into the instrument. The Company, at times, also uses forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the GBP-EUR exchange rates. The Company designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risks.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings within the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. During the remaining three months of fiscal 2024, the Company estimates that no amount relating to cross-currency swaps will be reclassified to interest expense.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its foreign exchange risk.

Table of Contents

| Foreign Currency Derivative       |   Number of Instruments | Notional Sold   | Notional Purchased   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Foreign currency forward contract |                       1 | £444            | €520                 |

## Net Investment Hedges

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in its Western European foreign entities and their exposure to the Euro. The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the foreign exchange rate on its foreign investment in Western Europe. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the USD-EUR exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in U.S. Dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. Cross-currency swaps involve the receipt of functionalcurrency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making foreign-currency- fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement.

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in AOCL as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of AOCL into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its net investments in foreign operations:

| Foreign Currency Derivative   |   Number of Instruments | Notional Sold   | Notional Purchased   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Cross-currency swap           |                       4 | €100,300        | $105,804             |

## Fair Value Hedges

The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its foreign denominated intercompany loans due to changes in foreign exchange spot rates. The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates affecting gains and losses on intercompany loan principal and interest. Cross-currency swaps involve the receipt of functional-currency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making foreigncurrency-fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest and other financing expense, net.

Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with the Company's accounting policy election. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. During the remaining three months of fiscal 2024, the Company estimates that an additional $121 relating to cross currency swaps will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge changes in fair value attributable to foreign exchange risk:

| Foreign Currency Derivative   |   Number of Instruments | Notional Sold   | Notional Purchased   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Cross-currency swap           |                       1 | €24,700         | $26,021              |

As of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges:

## 16. TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company initiated a multi-year growth, transformation and restructuring program (the "Hain Reimagined Program"). The Hain Reimagined Program is intended to optimize the Company's portfolio, improve underlying profitability and increase its flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth. The savings initiatives are expected to impact the Company's reportable segments and Corporate and Other.

Implementation of the Hain Reimagined Program is expected to be completed by the end of the 2027 fiscal year and is primarily comprised of: contract termination costs, asset write-downs, employee-related costs and other transformation-related expenses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, expenses associated with the Company's restructuring program in the amount of $1,353, $7,175, and $1,329, respectively, were recorded in Intangibles and long-lived asset impairment, Productivity and transformation costs, and Cost of sales, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For the nine months ended March 31, 2024, expenses associated with the Company's restructuring program in the amount of $22,019, $20,447, and $7,762, respectively, were recorded in Intangibles and long-lived asset impairment, Productivity and transformation costs, and Cost of sales, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The table below sets forth expenses associated with the Company's restructuring program for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 by reportable segment and Corporate and Other.

## 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Securities Class Actions Filed in Federal Court

On August 17, 2016, three securities class action complaints were filed in the Eastern District of New York (the "District Court") against the Company alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: (1) Flora v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al.; (2) Lynn v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al.; and (3) Spadola v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., et al. (collectively, the "Securities Complaints"). The Securities Complaints were ultimately consolidated under the caption In re The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Securities Litigation (the "Consolidated Securities Action"), and Rosewood Funeral Home and Salamon Gimpel were appointed as Co-Lead Plaintiffs. During the summer of 2017, a Corrected Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed, which named as defendants the Company and certain of its former officers (collectively, "Defendants") and asserted violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases and SEC filings regarding the Company's business, prospects, financial results and internal controls.

After Defendants' initial motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice to replead in October 2017, the Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on May 6, 2019 (the "Second Amended Complaint"). The Second Amended Complaint again named as defendants the Company and certain of its former officers and asserted violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations similar to those in the Correct Consolidated Amended Complaint. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on June 20, 2019. On April 6, 2020, the District Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. Co-Lead Plaintiffs appealed the District Court's decision dismissing the Second Amended Complaint to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the "Second Circuit"). By decision dated December 17, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The parties ultimately submitted supplemental briefing between May 12, 2022 and June 23, 2022, and in June 2022, the District Court referred Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint to a United States Magistrate Judge (the "Magistrate Judge") for a Report and Recommendation. On November 4, 2022, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the District Court grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. On September 29, 2023, the District Court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed notice of appeal on October 26, 2023, appealing the District Court's decision dismissing the Second Amended Complaint to the Second Circuit. Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed their opening brief on February 12, 2024. Defendants have until May 13, 2024 to file their opposition brief.

Additional Stockholder Class Action and Derivative Complaints Filed in Federal Court

The former Board of Directors and certain former officers of the Company are defendants in a consolidated action originally filed in 2017 in the Eastern District of New York under the captions Silva v. Simon, et al., Barnes v. Simon, et al., Merenstein v. Heyer, et al., and Oliver v. Berke, et al. Plaintiffs in the consolidated action, In re The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Stockholder Class and Derivative Litigation (the "Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action"), allege the violation of securities law, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs alleged in their Amended Complaint that the Company's former directors and certain former officers made materially false and misleading statements in press releases and SEC filings regarding the Company's business, prospects and financial results and that the Company violated its by-laws and Delaware law by failing to hold its 2016 Annual Stockholders Meeting and includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and corporate waste.

On December 20, 2017, the parties agreed to stay Defendants' time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the consolidated amended complaint through and including 30 days after a decision was rendered on the motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action, described above. After the District Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Consolidated Securities Action, the Co-Lead Plaintiffs in that action filed a Second Amended Complaint on May 6, 2019. The parties to the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action thereby agreed to continue the stay of Defendants' time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the consolidated amended complaint through 30 days after a decision on Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action.

On April 6, 2020, the District Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action, with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of an agreed-upon stay, Defendants in the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action had until May 6, 2020 to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the complaint in this matter. This deadline was extended, and Defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action Complaint on June 23, 2020, with Plaintiffs' opposition due August 7, 2020.

## Table of Contents

On July 24, 2020, Plaintiffs made a stockholder litigation demand on the current Board containing overlapping factual allegations to those set forth in the Consolidated Stockholder Class and Derivative Action. On November 3, 2020, Plaintiffs were informed that the Board of Directors had finished investigating and resolved, among other things, that the demand should be rejected. In light of the Second Circuit vacating the District Court's judgment in the Consolidated Securities Action referenced above and remanding the case for further proceedings, the Parties submitted a joint status report on December 29, 2021 requesting that the District Court continue the temporary stay pending the District Court's reconsideration of the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in the Consolidated Securities Action. The parties have agreed to extend the stay through the earlier of November 8, 2024 or 30 days after the Second Circuit issues a decision on Plaintiffs' appeal.

## Baby Food Litigation

Since February 2021, the Company has been named in numerous consumer class actions alleging that the Company's Earth's Best® baby food products (the "Products") contain unsafe and undisclosed levels of various naturally occurring heavy metals, namely lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury. Those actions have now been transferred and consolidated as a single lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned In re Hain Celestial Heavy Metals Baby Food Litigation, Case No. 2:21-cv-678 (the "Consolidated Proceeding"), which generally alleges that the Company violated various state consumer protection laws and asserts other state and common law warranty and unjust enrichment claims related to the alleged failure to disclose the presence of these metals, arguing that consumers would have either not purchased the Products or would have paid less for them had the Company made adequate disclosures. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint on November 7, 2022, which was opposed by the plaintiffs. On May 9, 2023, upon consent of the parties, the Court stayed the Consolidated Proceeding pending the Second Circuit's decision on appeal in In re Beech-Nut Nutrition Co. Baby Food Litigation, 21 Civ. 133 (N.D.N.Y.) (the "BeechNut Case"). Accordingly, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss without prejudice to renew.

By summary order dated January 18, 2024, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment dismissing the Beech-Nut Case and remanded for further proceedings. On February 15, 2024, the Company served a renewed motion to dismiss the Consolidated Proceeding. Plaintiffs served their opposition on March 14, 2024, and the Company served its reply on April 4, 2024. The Company's renewed motion to dismiss is now fully briefed and filed with the Court, and the Court has not scheduled oral argument on the motion to dismiss at this time. One consumer class action is pending in New York Supreme Court, Nassau County, which the court has stayed in deference to the Consolidated Proceeding. The Company denies the allegations in these lawsuits and contends that its baby foods are safe and properly labeled.

The claims raised in these lawsuits were brought in the wake of a highly publicized report issued by the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on Oversight and Reform, dated February 4, 2021 (the "House Report"), addressing the presence of heavy metals in baby foods made by certain manufacturers, including the Company. Since the publication of the House Report, the Company has also received information requests with respect to the advertising and quality of its baby foods from certain governmental authorities, as such authorities investigate the claims made in the House Report. The Company is fully cooperating with these requests and has provided documents and other requested information.

The Company has been named in one civil government enforcement action, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. Nurture, Inc., et al., which was filed by the New Mexico Attorney General against the Company and several other manufacturers based on the alleged presence of heavy metals in their baby food products. The Company and several other manufacturers moved to dismiss the New Mexico Attorney General's lawsuit, and the Court denied that motion. The Company filed its answer to the New Mexico Attorney General's amended complaint on April 23, 2022. The Company and several other manufacturers moved for reconsideration of the Court's order denying its motion to dismiss, and the Court denied that motion as well. The Company denies the New Mexico Attorney General's allegations and maintains that its baby foods are safe, properly labeled, and compliant with New Mexico law.

In addition to the consumer class actions discussed above, the Company is currently named in numerous lawsuits in state and federal courts alleging some form of personal injury from the ingestion of the Company's Products, purportedly due to unsafe and undisclosed levels of various naturally occurring heavy metals. These lawsuits generally allege injuries related to neurological development disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

## Other Cases

- · In the matter Palmquist v. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a jury trial commenced on February 6, 2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.

The Court entered Final Judgment in the Company's favor on March 3, 2023. On April 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal in the Fifth Circuit. Plaintiffs' appeal is fully briefed and oral argument took place before the Fifth Circuit on February 6, 2024.

The Hain Celestial Group, et al., in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles, judgment was entered on October 26, 2023 in favor of the defendants as a result of successful defense pretrial motions, including the Company's motion for summary judgment. The time for appeal has passed.

The Company denies that its Products led to any of the alleged injuries and will defend these cases vigorously. That said, as is common in circumstances of this nature, additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company in the future, asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. Such lawsuits may be resolved in a manner adverse to us, and we may incur substantial costs or damages not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.

## SEC Investigation

In November 2023, the staff of the SEC informed the Company it was conducting an investigation relating to Hain Celestial and requested documents primarily concerning (i) the Company's acquisition of one business and disposition of another business and certain related accounting matters and (ii) trading activity and other matters related to the Company's earnings guidance in certain previous fiscal years. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in this investigation.

## Other

In addition to the matters described above, the Company is and may be a defendant in lawsuits from time to time in the normal course of business.

With respect to all litigation and related matters, the Company records a liability when the Company believes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company has not recorded a liability for any of the matters disclosed in this note. It is possible that some matters could require the Company to pay damages, incur other costs or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of the end of the period covered by this report.

## Table of Contents

## 18. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's organizational structure consists of two geographic based reportable segments: North America and International, which are also the operating segments. This structure is in line with how the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") assesses the Company's performance and allocates resources. The Company uses segment net sales and segment Adjusted EBITDA in order to analyze segment results and trends.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes: net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity in net loss of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, net, unrealized currency losses, certain litigation and related costs, plant closure related costs, net, productivity and transformation costs, warehouse and manufacturing consolidation and other costs, net, costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, (gain) loss on sale of assets, inventory writedowns related to exited categories, intangibles and long-lived asset impairments and other adjustments. In addition, Segment Adjusted EBITDA does not include Corporate and Other expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to a reportable segment. Such Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to the entire enterprise, litigation expense and expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole.

The following tables set forth financial information about each of the Company's reportable segments. Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by the Company's CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance or allocating resources. Transactions between reportable segments were insignificant for all periods presented.

## Hain Reimagined Program

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we initiated a multi-year growth, transformation and restructuring program (the "Hain Reimagined Program") to drive shareholder returns. The savings initiatives are expected to impact our reportable segments and Corporate and Other. The program is intended to optimize our portfolio, improve underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth. Hain Reimagined Program is grounded on four strategic pillars:

- · Focus
- · Concentrate our portfolio in five consumer-centric Better-For-You ("BFY") platforms: Snacks, Baby & Kids, Beverages, Meal Preparation, and Personal Care.
- · Simplify our footprint, maintaining direct presence in five key markets - United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Western Europe - and align our global operating model and footprint, leveraging scale and realizing synergies across the business.

·

Grow

·

Build

·

Fuel

- · Drive revenue growth management, working capital management and operational efficiency to fund growth and enhance margins.

Cumulative pretax charges are expected to be $115 million - $125 million inclusive of potential inventory reductions of approximately $25 million related to brand/category exits. The balance of cumulative pretax restructuring charges is expected to be $90 million - $100 million comprised of contract termination costs, asset write-downs, employee-related costs and other transformation-related expenses. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred approximately $10 million and $50 million, respectively, of expenses associated with the Company's restructuring program. Annualized pretax savings are expected to be $130 million $150 million. As part of the Hain Reimagined Program, we initiated actions to consolidate our personal care manufacturing footprint and rationalize certain product categories for greater capacity utilization, cost reduction and margin expansion. The Company also simplified its distribution footprint in the U.S. and initiated actions to exit its non-strategic joint venture in India as part of the Focus and Fuel pillars of Hain Reimagined Program. Implementation of the Hain Reimagined Program is expected to be completed by the end of the 2027 fiscal year.

- · Enhance critical capabilities in brand building and effectiveness of marketing spend; expand reach across under-penetrated margin-accretive channels such as away-from-home and omni-channel e-commerce; and enhance our innovation capability to be more leading edge in BFY.
- · Deliver share gain in key platforms where we have the most compelling right to win, through expanded channel reach and acceleration in its innovation pipeline.

## Global Economic Environment

The duration and intensity of inflation fluctuations, the possibility of an impending recession, alterations in consumer shopping and consumption patterns, and shifts in geopolitical events, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the continuing Gaza Strip conflict, may lead to increased supply chain expenses, higher inflation, and other business impacts. We continually assess the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated operational results, liquidity, and capital resources.

## Net Sales

Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $438.4 million, a decrease of $16.9 million, or 3.7%, as compared to $455.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net sales, adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, decreased approximately $17.0 million, or 3.7%, from the prior year quarter due to a decline in the North America reportable segment, partially offset by growth in the International reportable segment. The effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $5.8 million. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below in the Segment Results section.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $96.7 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 0.8%, as compared to the prior year quarter. Gross profit margin of 22.1% was slightly higher when compared with 21.4% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by the North America reportable segment, mainly due to lower sales volume and recognition of charges in the three months ended March 31, 2024 associated with the consolidation of facilities, partially offset by improvements in pricing and productivity. Gross profit in the International reportable segment increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter mainly driven by lower cost of goods sold due to lower inflation and better prices on key commodities.

## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $66.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $8.3 million, or 11.1%, from $75.0 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation-related expenses.

## Intangibles and long-lived asset impairment

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $49.4 million primarily related to ParmCrisps , Thinsters , and certain North America personal care intangible asset impairment charges. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $156.6 million, primarily related to the ParmCrisps and Thinsters indefinite-lived trademarks and ParmCrisps definite-lived customer relationships, which reduced the carrying amount of such assets to their estimated fair value. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 14, Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. ® ® ® ® ®

## Productivity and Transformation Costs

Productivity and transformation costs were $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $3.2 million from $3.9 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Hain Reimagined Program, including reorganization of global functions and related personnel resource requirements and rationalizing our sourcing and supply chain processes.

## Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets

Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.6 million from $2.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting reduced amortization expenses due to impairment of the ParmCrisps customer relationships recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. ®

## Operating Loss

Operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $27.9 million compared to $140.9 million in the prior year quarter as a result of the items described above.

## Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net

Interest and other financing expense, net totaled $14.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.3%, from $13.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher borrowing rates, partially offset by a lower outstanding debt balance compared to the prior year quarter. See Note 9, Debt and Borrowings , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Other Expense, Net

Other expense, net was $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily attributable to lower foreign currency losses.

## Loss Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees

Loss before income taxes and equity in net loss of our equity-method investees for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $42.1 million compared to $154.8 million in the prior year quarter. The change was due to the items discussed above.

## Provision (benefit) for Income Taxes

The provision (benefit) for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax expense was $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a benefit of $39.6 million in the prior year quarter.

The effective income tax rate was an expense of 12.1% and a benefit of 25.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was impacted by an increase in the federal and state valuation allowance, tax expense related to stock-based compensation, global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was impacted by ParmCrisps and Thinsters trademarks and ParmCrisps asset group impairment charges, stock-based compensation and changes in uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rates in each period were also impacted by the geographical mix of earnings and state income taxes. ® ® ®

## Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees

Our equity in net loss from our equity-method investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. See Note 13, Investments , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Net Loss

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $48.2 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $115.7 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.

## Adjusted EBITDA

Our Adjusted EBITDA was $43.8 million and $37.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above and the adjustments described in the Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures presented following the discussion of our results of operations.

## Segment Results

Our organizational structure consists of two geographic based reportable segments: North America and International, which are also the operating segments. This structure is in line with how the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") assesses the Company's performance and allocates resources. The Company uses segment net sales and segment Adjusted EBITDA in order to analyze segment results and trends.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes: net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity in net loss of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, net, unrealized currency losses, certain litigation and related costs, plant closure related costs, net, productivity and transformation costs, warehouse and manufacturing consolidation and other costs, net, costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, (gain) loss on sale of assets, inventory writedowns related to exited categories, intangibles and long-lived asset impairments and other adjustments. In addition, Segment Adjusted EBITDA does not include Corporate and Other expenses related to the Company's centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to a reportable segment. Such Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company's senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, litigation expense and expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. We do not allocate amounts below operating (loss) income to our reportable segments.

The following table provides a summary of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

## North America

Our net sales in the North America reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $268.1 million, a decrease of $18.5 million, or 6.5%, from net sales of $286.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales in the personal care category on account of distribution losses and lower sales in the baby/kids category due to continued challenges in organic formula supply, partially offset by growth in the beverages category.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $27.9 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 2.5%, from Adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflected lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily associated with reduced compensationrelated costs and operating-model savings, partially offset by reduced gross profit reflecting lower sales volume and the impact of inflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.4%, a 90-basis point increase from the prior year period.

## Table of Contents

## International

Net sales in the International reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $170.3 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or 1.0%, from net sales of $168.6 million in the prior year quarter. The net sales increase was mainly driven by growth in the beverages category due to pricing and strong private label performance, partially offset by a decline in the meal preparation category. The increase also reflected 3.4% of growth from the favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $24.5 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or 15.4%, from Adjusted EBITDA of $21.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit reflecting higher net sales due to pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.4%, a 180-basis point increase from the prior year period.

## Corporate and Other

The decrease in Corporate and Other expenses primarily reflected a reduction in compensation-related expenses. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales in the baby/kids category on account of continued industry-wide challenges in organic formula supply, a decline in the personal care and meal preparation categories on account of distribution losses as well as lower sales in the snacks category.

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 was $77.8 million, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 19.3%, from Adjusted EBITDA of $96.5 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced gross profit reflecting the reduction in net sales discussed above and inflation, partially offset by improvements in productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.8%, a 150-basis point decrease from the prior year period.

## International

Net sales in the International reportable segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 were $521.7 million, an increase of $30.3 million, or 6.2%, from net sales of $491.4 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase reflected 5.6% of growth from the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The remainder of the net sales increase was mainly driven by growth in the meal preparation and beverages categories due to pricing and strong private label performance.

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 was $68.0 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 22.5%, from Adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit reflecting higher net sales due to pricing, partially offset by inflation and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increase in employee compensation-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.0%, a 170-basis point increase from the prior year period.

## Corporate and Other

The increase in Corporate and Other expenses primarily reflected an increase in consulting charges. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet anticipated operating and other expenditures for the foreseeable future. See Note 9, Debt and Borrowings , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

In addition to obligations under the Credit Agreement, we are party to other contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including purchase commitments and lease obligations, which impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. See Note 7, Leases .

## Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

On August 22, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the Credit Agreement (as amended by a First Amendment dated December 16, 2022, the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $1,100 million in the aggregate, consisting of (1) $300 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the "Term Loans") and (2) an $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit, and is comprised of a $440 million U.S. revolving credit facility and $360 million global revolving credit facility) (the "Revolver"). Both the Revolver and the Term Loans mature on December 22, 2026.

The Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require compliance with a consolidated secured leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company's maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio was amended to be 5.00:1.00 until September 30, 2023, 5.25:1.00 until December 31, 2023 and 5.00:1.00 until December 31, 2024 (the period of time during which such maximum consolidated secured leverage ratios are in effect, the "Second Amendment Period," which the Company may elect to end early). Following the Second Amendment Period, the maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio will be 4.25:1.00, subject to possible temporary increase following certain corporate acquisitions. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company 's maximum consolidated leverage ratio is 6.00:1.00. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company's minimum interest coverage ratio was amended to be 2.50:1.00.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company's consolidated secured leverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest coverage ratio were 3.85:1.00, 3.85:1.00 and 3.49:1.00, respectively, and the Company was in compliance with all associated covenants.

During the Second Amendment Period, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (a) Term SOFR plus 2.5% per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus 1.5% per annum. Following the Second Amendment Period, Loans will bear interest at rates based on (a) Term SOFR plus a rate ranging from 1.125% to 2.0% per annum or (b) the Base Rate plus a rate ranging from 0.125% to 1.0% per annum, the relevant rate in each case being the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate following the Second Amendment Period will be determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid, as set forth in the Credit Agreement as amended by the Second Amendment. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at March 31, 2024 was 8.10%. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the amount unused under the Credit Agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25% per annum, and such Commitment Fee is determined in accordance with a leverage-based pricing grid.

As of March 31, 2024, there were $496,000 of loans under the Revolver, $283,125 of Term Loans, and $3,188 letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2024, $300,812 was available under the Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with the financial covenants.

In addition to obligations under the Credit Agreement, we are party to other contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including purchase commitments and lease obligations, which impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. See Note 7, Leases , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $3.8 million at March 31, 2024 to $49.5 million as compared to $53.4 million at June 30, 2023. Our working capital was $299.6 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $59.3 million from $358.9 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Additionally, our total debt decreased by $51.2 million at March 31, 2024 to $777.5 million as compared to $828.7 million at June 30, 2023 as a result of $50.6 million of net repayments carried out during the period.

Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Western Europe, the Middle East and India. As of March 31, 2024, substantially all cash was held outside of the United States.

We maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash (used in) provided by operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below.

Cash provided by operating activities was $77.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $50.7 million from $26.3 million in the prior year period. This increase versus the prior period resulted primarily from higher cash generation of $81.9 million from our working capital accounts, which was driven by our accounts payable optimization initiatives and focused inventory management, partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable recovery. The increase was also partially offset by a reduction of $31.2 million in net loss adjusted for non-cash charges in the current period.

Cash used in investing activities was $23.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $10.0 million from $13.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to higher capital expenditure in the current period by $3.3 million on account of phasing of capital projects and receipt of $7.5 million of proceeds from the divestiture of Westbrae during the prior year period ended March 31, 2023.

Cash used in financing activities was $56.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $21.3 million compared to $34.8 million in the prior year period. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher net debt repayment during the nine months ended March 31, 2024.

## Free Cash Flow

Our free cash flow was $52.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $47.3 million from $4.9 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2023. This increase versus the prior year period resulted primarily from an increase in cash flows from operations of $50.7 million driven by the reasons explained above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

## Share Repurchase Program

In January 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans, in private transactions or otherwise. The current 2022 authorization does not have a stated expiration date. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. During the nine months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased no shares under the repurchase program. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $173.5 million of remaining authorization under the share repurchase program.

## Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures

We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.

For each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believe the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors use the non-U.S. GAAP measures. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

## Net Sales - Adjusted for the Impact of Divestitures and Discontinued Brands

We exclude the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands when comparing net sales to prior periods, which results in the presentation of certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that excluding the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands when presenting period-over-period results of net sales aids in comparability.

To present net sales adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, the net sales of a divested business or discontinued brand are excluded from all periods. A reconciliation between reported net sales and net sales adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands is as follows:

## Adjusted EBITDA

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity in net loss of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, net, unrealized currency losses (gains), certain litigation and related costs, CEO succession costs, plant closure related costs, net, productivity and transformation costs, warehouse and manufacturing consolidation and other costs, net, costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, (gains) losses on sales of assets, inventory write-downs related to exited categories, intangibles and long-lived asset impairment and other adjustments. The Company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the Company and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results. A reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

## Free Cash Flow

In our internal evaluations, we use the non-GAAP financial measure "Free Cash Flow." The difference between Free Cash Flow and cash flows provided by or used in operating activities, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that Free Cash Flow reflects the impact of purchases of property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash flows provided by or used in operating activities. We view Free Cash Flow as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider Free Cash Flow in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation from cash flows provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow is as follows:

## Critical Accounting Estimates

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies; however, materially different amounts may be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have applied. The accounting policies that have been identified as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of our operations pertain to variable consideration, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. The application of each of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, from which there have been no material changes, except for the items noted below.

## Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows. The assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability, our estimated working capital needs, as well as our weighted average cost of capital. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses. Estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors. These key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and are subject to change based on, among others, industry and geopolitical conditions, our ability to navigate changing macroeconomic conditions and trends and the timing and success of strategic initiatives. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

In each quarter subsequent to our annual impairment assessment, we review events that occur or circumstances that change, including the macroeconomic environment, our business performance and our market capitalization, to determine if a quantitative impairment assessment is necessary. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (i.e., as a result of changes in interest rates or other conditions), lower than expected sales and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA multiples, the inability to quickly replace lost co-manufacturing business, or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. As a result of indicators of impairment which included significant decline in the Company's market capitalization and impairment charges recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024 within the United States (U.S.) reporting unit as noted in Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 6, Property, Plant and Equipment, Net , the Company completed an interim impairment test of all reporting units. For United Kingdom, Western Europe, Canada, and Ella's Kitchen UK, the Company performed a qualitative evaluation to assess factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company concluded that the qualitatively tested reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying amounts. Three of these reporting units (United Kingdom, Western Europe and Canada) were quantitatively tested in fiscal 2023 and as of the last quantitative testing date, their estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying amounts by more than 17.7%.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed an interim quantitative impairment test of goodwill in the U.S. reporting unit and concluded that the reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated utilizing a blended approach which included an income approach utilizing the Discounted Cash Flows ("DCF") Method and the Guideline Public Company Methodology ("GPCM"), a market-based approach.

The United States reporting unit is at risk of impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in assumptions, including forecasted future cash flows based on execution of strategic initiatives for increasing revenue, as well as discount rates and other macroeconomic factors. We monitor our reporting units at risk of impairment for interim impairment indicators and believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations are reasonable as of March 31, 2024. We performed qualitative procedures related to our other four reporting units, noting that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as of March 31, 2024.

Should the fair value of any of our reporting units fall below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines including a deterioration of the macroeconomic factors, changes in the discount rate, or other adverse conditions, goodwill impairment charges may be necessary in future periods. We performed a sensitivity test and noted that an increase in the U.S. weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") by 1 percentage point, holding other assumptions constant, would not result in recognition of an impairment charge. The calculation of the U.S. reporting unit WACC included a number of subjective inputs, including a company-specific risk premium of 4.0% to account for the riskiness of the assumed revenue growth and margin improvement within the financial forecasts used in the DCF Method.

We performed a market capitalization reconciliation with the expectation that the market capitalization should reconcile within a reasonable range of the sum of the fair values of the individual reporting units. Such reconciliation often includes both qualitative and quantitative assessments as is the case with the Company's reporting units as of March 31, 2024. When an entity performs a qualitative assessment for some reporting units but proceeds to a quantitative assessment for others, reconciling the overall market capitalization to the aggregate fair value of reporting units can be challenging and requires significant judgment. There is no requirement to determine the fair value of reporting units for which only a qualitative impairment test is performed. Therefore, when performing an overall comparison to market capitalization, we included the current year fair value for reporting units for which a quantitative measurement was performed, and we estimated the fair value for the reporting units for which qualitative assessments were performed using a reasonable methodology. Upon performing the market capitalization reconciliation, we noted a reasonable reconciliation between the sum of the reporting unit fair values and the Company's market capitalization once adjusted for the impact of corporate costs not allocated to the reporting units.

## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company performs an indefinite-lived asset impairment test annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. In accordance with ASC 350, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment, it first shall assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. One procedure we perform during interim periods to determine whether indicators of impairment are present includes a comparison of net sales used in the most recent quantitative impairment tests to forecasted net sales for the same fiscal year (or balance of the fiscal year when performing an interim review) in order to identify brands for which the current fiscal year net sales are expected to be lower than the forecasted fiscal year net sales per the latest quantitative test. The performance of these brands is then reviewed by management to determine if the shortfall to forecasted net sales was related to events and circumstances that are expected to be temporary in nature, or if it was caused by more pervasive issue that could serve as in impairment indicator (e.g., loss of key customers, discontinuance of certain product categories within a brand, etc.). We use this risk-based approach to determine which brands we would quantitatively test for impairment, whether as part of fiscal year annual impairment testing or an interim period test. During the third quarter of 2024, we qualitatively assessed our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and determined that the indefinite-lived tradenames for certain North America personal care tradenames (namely, Alba Botanica , Avalon Organics , and JASON ), ParmCrisps and Thinsters should be quantitatively tested. The Company's 2024 interim impairment testing resulted in the recognition of impairment charges for the following indefinite-lived tradenames, and other intangible assets: ParmCrisps , Thinsters and certain North America personal care tradenames. ® ® ® ® ® ® ®

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of further expected decline in the actual and projected performance and cash flows, the Company completed an interim quantitative impairment test of indefinite-lived trademarks associated with certain North America personal care brands, as noted in Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company recorded impairment charges and reduced the carrying amount of such intangible assets to their estimated fair value of $13,000. These intangible assets have an increased risk of future impairment due to the potential risk of failure on the execution of the Company's strat egy and associated impact on the assumptions utilized in developing its fair value estimate as of March 31, 2024.

Further, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company, noted that two of its plant-based beverage brands: Happy™ and Joya have risk of future impairment due to declining sales on account of changing consumer preference to switch from branded to private label products. The assets are part of the International reportable segment and have a remaining aggregate carrying amount of $6,150 as of March 31, 2024. ®

## Seasonality

Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.
