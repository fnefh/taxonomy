Item 1. Business
Part I
Our Company: Bringing Ethical Food to the Table
Vital Farms is an ethically minded food company that is disrupting the U.S. food system. We have developed a framework that challenges the norms of the
factory food model and allows us to bring high-quality products from our network of family farms to a national audience. This framework has enabled us to become the
leading U.S. brand of pasture-raised eggs and the second-largest U.S. egg brand by retail dollar sales. Our ethics are exemplified by our focus on animal welfare and
sustainable farming practices, including regenerative agricultural practices. We believe our standards produce happy hens with varied diets, which produce better eggs.
As an ethical food company, we're helping meet consumer demand for natural, traceable, great-tasting and nutritious food.
Our purpose is rooted in a commitment to Conscious Capitalism, and our belief in co-creating positive, long-term outcomes with all of our stakeholders - farmers
and suppliers, customers and consumers, communities and the environment, employees, who we refer to as crew members, and stockholders. Our approach has been
validated by our financial performance and our impact on the food industry. We are also a Certified B Corporation, a designation reserved for businesses that balance
profit and purpose to meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability.

We have scaled our brand through our strong relationships with family farms and deliberate efforts to design and build the infrastructure to bring our products to
a national audience. Today, with a network of more than 300 family farms, we believe we have set the national standard for pasture-raised eggs. We believe our
relationships with family farms and the efficiency of our supply chain provide us with a competitive advantage in the consumer packaged goods industry, in which
achieving reliable supply at a national scale can be challenging. In 2017, we opened Egg Central Station, a shell egg processing facility in Springfield, Missouri, which
is centrally located within our network of family farms. In April 2022, we completed an expansion of Egg Central Station that nearly doubled its square footage and
capacity. Egg Central Station is capable of packing six million eggs per day and has achieved Safe Quality Food, or SQF, Excellent rating, the highest level of such
certification recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative, or GFSI. In addition, Egg Central Station has received the Safe Quality Food Institute, or SQFI, Select Site
certification, indicating that the site has voluntarily elected to undergo annual unannounced recertification audits by SQFI, the organization responsible for administering
a global food safety and quality program known as the SQF Program. The design of Egg Central Station includes investments that support each of our stakeholders, from
our crew members (daylighting, climate control and slip resistant floors in the egg grading room), to the community and environment (consulting with the community
before we built the facility, restoring native vegetation on the property, water retention and stormwater management measures and the use of solar panels), to our
customers and consumers (food safety and maintenance investments far beyond regulatory requirements). Our efforts to build a sustainable, stakeholder-focused facility
were recognized by the industry publication Food Processing, which named Egg Central Station as its 2022 "Green Plant of the Year." We believe owning and operating
this important element of our supply chain is a key differentiator and provides us with a competitive advantage, which we intend to continue to leverage to grow both our
net revenue and gross margin. We are currently in the process of exploring potential sites for an additional egg packing facility.
Our loyal and growing consumer base has fueled the expansion of our brand from the natural channel to the mainstream channel and has facilitated our growth
within the foodservice channel. As of December 2023, we offered 23 retail stock keeping units, or SKUs, through a multi-channel retail distribution network across
approximately 24,000 stores. Our products generate stronger velocities and, we believe, greater profitability per unit for our retail customers in key traffic-generating
categories as compared to products offered by our competitors. We believe we have significant room for growth within the retail and foodservice channels, and we
believe that we can capture this opportunity by growing brand awareness and through new product innovation. We also believe there are incremental growth
opportunities in additional distribution channels, including the convenience, drugstore, club, military and international markets, which we may access along with retail
and foodservice growth opportunities to enable us to continue our net revenue growth.
We have built a sustainable company founded on products that resonate with consumers. Our trusted brand and Conscious Capitalism-focused business model
have resulted in significant growth. We have increased net revenue from $140.8 million in fiscal 2019 to $471.9 million in fiscal 2023, which represents a 35.3%
compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR. Going forward, we believe that consumer movement away from factory farming practices will continue to fuel demand for
our products, and in September 2023, we announced updated long-term financial targets reflecting our continued confidence in the potential of our business. Our
management team is committed to ensuring our values remain aligned with those of our consumers while delivering stockholder value.
Evidence of our historical success in continuing to scale our business is shown in the graphics below. Dates refer to the fiscal years ended December 30, 2019,

Our History
Vital Farms was founded in 2007 on a 27-acre plot of land in Austin, Texas. Armed with a small flock of hens, the company maintained a strong belief that a
varied diet and better animal welfare practices would lead to superior eggs. Our first sales came from farmers markets and restaurants around Austin and, less than a year
later, our eggs were discovered by Whole Foods Market, Inc., or Whole Foods. From the beginning, we sought to not simply sell eggs to a few stores, but to build a
sustainable company that aligned with the family farming community and was able to profitably deliver quality products to a devoted consumer base. As our business
has continued to grow, our model remains rooted in trust and mutual accountability with our farmers, who are and will remain core to our business.

# Page 7 of 100

In 2014, our current President and Chief Executive Officer Russell Diez-Canseco joined Vital Farms and led the development of our large and scalable network
of family farms. In 2015, recognizing the opportunity to elevate our production process and bolster long-term growth and profitability, we began the design process for
Egg Central Station, which opened in 2017 in Springfield, Missouri. Today, Egg Central Station is capable of packing six million eggs per day and has achieved an SQF
Excellent rating, the highest level of such certification from the GFSI.
Demand for our high-quality products has enabled us to expand our brand beyond the natural channel and into the mainstream channel through relationships
with Albertsons Companies, Inc., or Albertsons, The Kroger Co., or Kroger, Publix Super Markets, Inc., or Publix, Target Corporation, or Target, Walmart Inc., or
Walmart, and numerous other national and regional food retailers. As of December 2023, our products were sold in approximately 24,000 stores nationwide. Over the
course of our journey, our founder, Matthew O'Hayer, has continued to inform our strategic vision and remains intimately involved with our business as the Executive
Chairperson of our Board of Directors.
Our Purpose
Our purpose is to improve the lives of people, animals and the planet through food. Our mission is to bring ethical food to the table. We carry out our purpose
and mission by partnering with family farms that operate within our strictly defined set of ethical farming practices. We are motivated by the influence we have on rural
communities through creating impactful, long-term business opportunities for family farmers. Moreover, we are driven to stand up for sustainable production practices
that have been largely cast aside under the factory farming system. In our view, the factory farming system has been consistently misguided, focused on producing
products at lowest cost rather than driving long-term and sustainable benefits for all stakeholders.
Since inception, our values have been rooted in the principles of Conscious Capitalism. We believe managing our business in the best interest of all our
stakeholders will result in a more successful and sustainable enterprise. A key premise of our business model is our consumer-centric approach, which focuses on
identifying consumer needs and developing products that address these needs. While remaining committed to ethical decision-making, we have achieved strong financial
performance and earned the Certified B Corporation designation, reflecting our role as a contributor to the global cultural shift toward redefining success in business in
order to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy. We believe our consumers connect with Vital Farms because they love our products, relate to our values and
trust our practices.
Industry Overview
We operate in the large and growing U.S. natural food and beverage industry. Consumer awareness of the negative health, environmental and agricultural impacts
of processed food and factory farming standards has resulted in increased consumer demand for ethically produced food. We believe this trend has had a meaningful
impact on the growth of the natural food industry, which is increasingly penetrating the broader U.S. food market as mainstream retailers respond to consumer demand.
We believe increased demand for natural food and a willingness to pay a premium for brands focused on transparency, sustainability and ethical values will continue to
be a catalyst for our growth.
According to SPINS, LLC, or SPINS, data, the U.S. shell egg market accounted for approximately $9.0 billion in retail sales in 2023 and grew at a CAGR of
10.3% between December 2020 and December 2023. Our relatively low household penetration of 7.5%, compared to the shell egg category penetration of
approximately 96.5%, provides a significant long-term growth opportunity for our business. According to SPINS data, the U.S. pasture-raised retail egg market
accounted for approximately $531.0 million in retail sales in 2023 and grew at a CAGR of 26.6% between December 2020 and December 2023, while the specialty egg
(including pasture-raised, free-range and cage-free) market accounted for approximately $1.8 billion in retail sales in 2023 and grew at a CAGR of 11.2% between
December 2020 and December 2023. According to SPINS data, the U.S. butter market accounted for approximately $4.8 billion in retail sales in 2023 and grew at a
CAGR of 5.3% between December 2020 and December 2023. We believe the strength of our platform, coupled with significant investments in our crew members and
infrastructure, position us to continue to deliver industry-leading growth across new and existing categories.
Our Strengths
Trusted Brand Aligned with Consumer Demands
We believe consumers have grown to trust our brand because of our adherence to our values and a high level of transparency. We believe consumers are
increasingly focused on the source of their food and are willing to pay a premium for brands that deliver transparency, sustainability and integrity. As a company
focused on driving the success of our stakeholders, our brand resonates with consumers who seek to align themselves with companies that share their values. Through
our Vital Times newsletter, utilization of social media outlets and our high-touch consumer engagement marketing campaigns, we cultivate and support our relationship
with consumers by communicating our values, building trust and promoting brand loyalty.

Strategic and Valuable Brand for Retailers
Our historical performance has demonstrated that we are a strategic and valuable partner to retailers. We have reached a broad set of consumers through a variety
of retail partners, including Albertsons, Kroger, Publix, Target and Walmart. As of December 2023, we were the number one or two egg brand by retail dollar sales for
branded eggs with key customers such as Albertsons, Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market, or Sprouts, Target and Whole Foods. We believe the success of our brand
demonstrates that consumers are demanding premium products that meet a higher ethical standard. We have expanded into the mainstream channel while continuing to
command premium prices for our products. We believe that our products are more attractive to retail customers because they help generate growth, deliver strong gross
profits and drive strong velocities.
Supply Chain Rooted in Commitment to Our Stakeholders
Our ongoing commitment to the social and economic interests of our stakeholders guides our supply chain decisions. We carefully select and collaborate with
family farms in the Pasture Belt, the U.S. region where the weather is conducive to hens being outside as much as possible. We establish supply contracts that we believe
are attractive for all parties, demonstrate our commitment to our network of family farms through educational programs that transfer critical best practice knowledge and
pay farmers competitive prices for high-quality eggs. We believe our commitment to farmers facilitates more sustainable farm operations and significantly reduces
turnover. Our network of family farms gives us a strategic advantage through a scaled and sustainable supply chain and allows us to go to market with the highest quality
premium products.
Map of the Pasture Belt
img205780192_3.jpg
Experienced and Passionate Team
We have an experienced and passionate executive management team that has over 100 years of combined industry experience and includes our President and
Chief Executive Officer Russell Diez-Canseco, a seasoned food industry expert with over 19 years of relevant experience, including at H-E-B, a privately held
supermarket chain. Our leadership team works in partnership with Matthew O'Hayer, our founder and the Executive Chairperson of our Board of Directors, who
continues to inform our strategic vision with the entrepreneurial perspective gained through over 40 years of building businesses. We also have a deep bench of talent
with strong business and operational experience, and crew members at all levels of our organization who are passionate about addressing the needs of our stakeholders.
We have leveraged the experience and passion of our leadership team, our founder and Executive Chairperson, and our other crew members to grow net revenue at a
CAGR of 35.3% since 2019, enter our second major food category, butter, and build and expand our first shell egg processing facility, Egg Central Station.

## Our Growth Strategies

We believe our investments in our brand, our stakeholders and our infrastructure position us to continue delivering industry-leading growth that outpaces both
the natural food industry and the overall food industry.

**Compete to Win in Our Current Categories**

We continue to compete at the top of our current categories, which helps fuel our continued, profitable growth and we believe there is significant opportunity to
further grow volume with existing retail customers by building consumer awareness and demand for our brand. Our products generate stronger velocities and, we
believe, greater profitability per unit for our retail customers in the categories in which we compete. By capturing greater shelf space, driving higher product velocities
and increasing our average SKU count per retail partner, we believe there is meaningful runway for further growth with existing retail customers. Beyond our existing
retail footprint, we believe there are significant opportunities to gain incremental stores from existing retail customers and to add new retail customers. Additionally, we
believe there is significant demand for our products in the foodservice channel since we offer versatile ingredients with high menu penetrations across commercial and
non-commercial operator segments. We also believe there are significant further long-term opportunities in additional distribution channels, including the convenience,
drugstore and club channels. We see considerable opportunity for medium- to long-term growth in this channel by increasing our category market share through sales to
values-aligned foodservice operators and their distributors.

**Expand Our Portfolio**

We plan to continue seeking out opportunities to expand our product offerings. We believe making strategic bets on larger-scale opportunities will help reinforce
our position as an ethical food company. The successes of our core products have confirmed our belief that there is significant demand for ethically produced food
products, and our proprietary consumer surveys confirm our belief that there is significant demand for our brand across a wide spectrum of food categories. We are
committed to continuing to introduce consumers to our expanding range of product offerings.

**Strengthen the Brand**

We will compete in the marketplace by continuing to build long-term trusted relationships with our target consumer. Critical to the success of this mission is our
ability to share our story with a broader audience. We intend to increase our household penetration by educating consumers about our brand, our values and the premium
quality of our products. Our relatively low household penetration of 7.5% for our shell eggs, compared to the shell egg category penetration of approximately 96.5%,
demonstrates that expanding the national presence of our brand offers a significant runway for future growth. We believe we are well positioned to further increase
household penetration of our products given their alignment with consumer trends and approachability with consumers. We intend to increase the number of consumers
who buy our products by using digitally integrated media campaigns, social media tools, earned awareness drivers like press outreach and other owned media channels.
We believe these efforts will educate consumers on our values and the attractive attributes of our products, generate further demand for our products and ultimately
expand our consumer base.

**Scale a World-Class Organization**

We have always believed that our most important competitive advantage is great people, operating as one high-performing team in a strong culture, with the
right tools to help us reach our potential, both individually and collectively. Our strategic and people functions are led by a single leader in order to unify our
organization in attracting talent that supports our growth initiatives and our culture. This effort is critical not only to our current success but the direction of our company
in the future. As we continue our focus on scaling a world-class organization, we believe this tighter link between where we are going, the processes we will put in place
to get there, and, most importantly, how we engage, inspire, and develop our crew members will fuel our continued growth.

# Product Overview
We produce products sourced from animals raised on family farms, including shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs and liquid whole eggs.

img205780192_4.jpg

## Shell Eggs
Our original and core product is shell eggs. We defined the pasture-raised egg category by following European-rooted standards codified by the Certified Humane Program, which require each hen to have at least 108 square feet of land and daily outdoor access. Our shell eggs are ethically produced, and our consumers consistently tell us that they provide a richer taste and color than other eggs on the market. The retail varieties of our shell eggs are based on supplemental feed type (certified organic and conventional), egg size (medium, large, extra-large and jumbo) and pack size (6, 12, and 18 count). Our shell egg varieties also include True Blues (pasture-raised heirloom eggs with distinct blue shells) and Restorative Eggs (eggs from farms employing enhanced regenerative agricultural standards).

img205780192_5.jpg

## Butter
In 2015, we saw an opportunity in the U.S. refrigerated value-added dairy market for premium butter with artisanal qualities, such as higher butterfat content, sea salt and traditional slow-churn methods. Our consumer research and basket analysis also identified butter as a highly complementary product category to eggs in terms of usage and buyer profile. Today, we offer unsalted and sea salted varieties of our butter, which is sold in two-stick and four-stick packs.

img205780192_6.jpg

## Hard-Boiled Eggs and Liquid Whole Eggs
img205780192_7.jpg

In March 2018, we launched hard-boiled eggs to broaden the appeal of our brand and satisfy an incremental usage occasion—ready-to-eat snacking. That launch was followed by the introduction of our liquid whole eggs in August 2019. We currently provide one of the only pasture-raised liquid whole egg offerings in the U.S. processed egg market, which has seen little innovation in decades and has traditionally been dominated by egg whites.

Motivated by our mission, our success and our customers' feedback, we continue to innovate and expand our product offerings to address growing consumer demand.

# Page 11 of 100

Innovation
The successes of our core products have confirmed our belief that there is significant demand for ethically produced food products. We expect to continue to
expand our product offerings through innovation in both existing and new categories. We will continue to leverage comprehensive consumer insights and trend data to
provide innovative solutions and ideas that meet new consumer needs and usage occasions. We also have a proven innovation model that utilizes a trusted network of
partners to bring products to market without requiring significant upfront investment. We are committed to continuing to introduce consumers to our expanding range of
product offerings.
Marketing
Our multifaceted, consumer-centric marketing strategy has been instrumental in building our brand and driving net revenue. Our marketing strategy is aimed at
solidifying our brand's position as a leading provider of ethically produced food. We execute this strategy by advertising through digitally integrated media campaigns,
social media tools. earned awareness drivers like press outreach and other owned media channels. Our standout packaging has been a signature communication vehicle
since our inception. We maintain a presence across all major social media platforms.
Our brand has grown rapidly into the #1 U.S. pasture-raised, #1 U.S. natural channel and #2 U.S. overall egg brand by retail dollar sales, with an over 85% share
of the U.S. pasture-raised retail egg segment for the 53-week period ended December 31, 2023. Our brand awareness is represented by a strong social media following,
with approximately 140,000 Instagram followers. Building on prior success, we will continue to invest in the brand through digitally integrated national media
campaigns and build customer loyalty through other media formats, including our quirky Vital Times newsletter, now in its twelfth year of print, which is placed in each
egg carton. We have circulated more than 150 million copies of our Vital Times newsletter since 2021.
Building upon a landscape of shifting consumer preferences, we are focused on reaching new consumers to educate them about our ethically focused value
proposition. We work continuously to understand our consumers and leverage those insights to develop impactful communication plans and messaging. We remain
focused on deploying our sophisticated marketing capabilities and world-class sales team to ensure that both customers and consumers understand the Vital Farms story.
Our Customers
We market our products throughout the United States, with the majority of our net revenue coming from our shell egg products. As of December 2023, we
distribute through third parties and direct to retailers to reach approximately 24,000 stores. With significant expansion in recent years, our retail sales are distributed
between the natural channel and mainstream channel. Because of our brand equity, loyal consumer base and line of high-quality products, we believe there are attractive
growth opportunities across these channels, in addition to a sizable opportunity in the foodservice channel. We believe there are also incremental growth opportunities in
additional distribution channels, including the convenience, drugstore, club, military and international markets, which we may access along with retail growth
opportunities to enable us to continue our net revenue growth.
Natural Channel
Natural channel retailers, including Whole Foods and Sprouts, represented approximately 42%, 39% and 39% of our retail dollar sales in fiscal years 2021, 2022
and 2023, respectively.
Mainstream Channel
Widespread consumer demand for high-quality and traceable foods has driven our expansion into the mainstream channel with national retailers, including
Albertsons, Kroger, Publix, Target and Walmart. The mainstream channel represented approximately 58%, 61% and 61% of our retail dollar sales in fiscal years 2021,
2022 and 2023, respectively.
Foodservice Channel
In addition to our primary natural and mainstream channels, we sell shell and value-added eggs into the foodservice channel, which includes commercial and
non-commercial foodservice operators. We expect our foodservice business to continue to grow in the medium- to long-term through our two-pronged sales approach.
We anticipate growing our foodservice distribution penetration through our relationships, for example, with Dot Foods, the largest redistribution company in the
country, and broad-line distributors, including Sysco, US Foods, Performance Food Group, Gordon Food Service and Ben E. Keith. By deepening our distribution
penetration, we are becoming more accessible to foodservice operators across the country. We anticipate more growth with values-aligned regional and national
restaurants that want to innovate their menus with our quality, ethically produced eggs.

# Page 12 of 100

In fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023, the foodservice channel accounted for approximately 1%, 3% and 6%, respectively, of our net revenue.
Our established foodservice relationships help to extend our marketing efforts through unique co-branding opportunities, which amplify our consumer awareness
and allow us to reach new households. We will continue to capitalize on these co-marketing tactics as we work to bring new foodservice operators into our customer
base.
A multi-unit example from our successful foodservice program is True Food Kitchen, an award-winning restaurant brand and a pioneer of wellness-driven dining
with over 40 locations across the country that shares our values for improving the lives of people, animals and the planet. Our collaboration is a recipe for success to
serve nourishing food that people know they can trust. At the start of 2023, True Food Kitchen committed to exclusively using our pasture-raised eggs for its menu and
calling out our brand in its marketing channels.
img205780192_8.jpg
We have launched similar relationships with national foodservice operators, including Hopdoddy Burger Bar and Chicken N Pickles. Additionally, we have
regional chain collaborations across the country. Several examples include:
•HomeState, a growing brand in Southern California focused on Texas food and genuine hospitality;
•Black Seed Bagels, a bagel brand with locations across the New York metropolitan area;
•King David Tacos, which sells breakfast tacos made exclusively with our eggs at a brick-and-mortar location, multiple cart locations and over 70 retail partners
in the New York City area;
•Tacodeli, which sells breakfast tacos made exclusively with our shell eggs across restaurant locations and points of distribution, such as coffee shops and
farmers' market stands, across Texas;
•Pura Vida, a fresh all-day concept in South Florida;
•Cafe Patachou, a breakfast and lunch restaurant chain based in the Indianapolis, Indiana area;
•Blue Plate Restaurant Company, a casual dining group in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota area;
•Moe's Broadway Bagel, an East Coast-style family-run bagel chain in the Denver and Boulder, Colorado area.

# Supply Chain
We have strategically designed our supply chain to ensure high production standards and optimal year-round operation. We are motivated by the positive impact
we have on rural communities and enjoy a strong relationship and reputation with our network of more than 300 family farms. In order to capitalize on this strong
supply network, we built a state-of-the-art shell egg processing facility, Egg Central Station in Springfield, Missouri. Following its expansion in April 2022, Egg Central
Station is approximately 153,000 square feet and utilizes highly automated equipment to grade and package our shell egg products. The design of our facility includes
investments in support of each of our stakeholders, from our crew members, to the community and the environment, to our customers and consumers.

Our eggs are kept in on-farm coolers using equipment that meets our precise standards. The eggs are then collected on a regular basis by a third-party freight
carrier and placed in cold storage until packing for shipment to customers. Each of our butter, hard-boiled egg and liquid whole egg products is produced by a co-
manufacturer (with eggs from our network of family farms used for our hard-boiled egg and liquid whole egg products). To support the growth of our business, we are
focused on expanding existing co-manufacturing relationships where appropriate and establishing new relationships.

Our egg packaging consists primarily of corrugated boxes and egg cartons. Our corrugated boxes are sourced from a supplier in Springfield, Missouri, and our
egg cartons are substantially sourced from a single-source supplier from Missouri, Canada and Europe. Our other products are packaged in film and cartons that are
primarily managed by our co-manufacturers. In every case, we strive to find the most sustainable and environmentally considered packaging, shipping materials and
inks.

# Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment across each of our product categories. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including producers of
private-label products as well as producers of other branded egg and butter products that compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete
with large egg companies such as Cal-Maine, Inc. and large international food companies such as Ornua Co-operative Limited (Kerrygold). We also compete with local
and regional egg and dairy companies as well as private-label specialty products processed by other egg and dairy companies. In our market, competition is based on,
among other things, product quality and taste, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety, product packaging and package design, shelf space, reputation, price,
advertising, promotion and nutritional claims.

Across the industry, eggs may be sourced from hens that are caged, cage-free, free-range or pasture-raised. Large egg companies offer commodity eggs sourced
from caged hens, and in an attempt to address growing consumer demand for ethically produced and higher quality eggs, they have also grown their cage-free, free-range
and pasture-raised offerings.

Although we operate in competitive industries, we believe that we have a strong and sustainable competitive advantage based on an ongoing process of values-
driven decisions, our fundamental commitment to producing ethically minded food, the trust we have developed in our brand and our ability to provide reliable supply to
our distribution partners and customers. We built and operate what we believe is one of the largest sourcing and distribution networks of family farms with strong growth
potential. By focusing on the interests of each of our stakeholders, we believe we have created a model that attracts the best family farm partners, produces the highest
quality products and creates benefits for all parties. We believe our experience in building this network will provide significant scale and execution advantages as we
continue to expand.

# Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, such as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, or USDA; the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA; and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. These laws and regulations apply to the processing, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality,
safety, importation and transportation of our products, as well as our occupational safety and health practices.

Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for
quality and safety and regulate our products and the manufacturing, labeling, marketing, promotion and advertising thereof. With respect to eggs in particular, the FDA
and the USDA split jurisdiction depending on the type of product involved. While the FDA has primary responsibility for the regulation of shell eggs, the USDA has
primary responsibility for the regulation of dried, frozen or liquid eggs and other "egg products," subject to certain exceptions.

Among other things, the facilities in which our products are manufactured or processed must register with the FDA and/or the USDA, comply with current good
manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and comply with a range of food safety and labeling requirements established by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, or FSMA, the Egg Products Inspection Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Organic Foods Production
Act and the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, among other laws implemented by the FDA, the USDA and other regulators. The FDA and the USDA have the
authority to inspect these facilities depending on the type of product involved. For example, Egg Central Station, our facility in Springfield, Missouri, has been subject to
periodic inspections by the USDA to evaluate compliance with certain applicable requirements, and the FDA may likewise inspect the facility. Additionally, we are
subject to requirements under FSMA's foreign supplier verification program and import tariffs, bond and other requirements by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for
supply for our butter products, which we began importing from Ireland in late 2023. The FDA and the USDA also require that certain nutrition and product information
appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that our marketing and
advertising be truthful, non-misleading and not deceptive to consumers. We are also restricted from making certain types of claims about our products, including
nutrient content claims, health claims, organic claims and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or
implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements.
In addition, our suppliers are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. For example, the farmers who produce our shell eggs may be subject to requirements
implemented by the FDA pertaining to pest control, salmonella enteritidis prevention and other requirements.
We are also subject to state and local food safety regulation, including registration and licensing requirements for our facilities, enforcement of standards for our
products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling our products.
We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection
regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our co-manufacturers, distributors and suppliers, are
subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.

**Certified B Corporation**

While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance,
accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we
were designated as a Certified B Corporation in December 2015.

In order to be designated as a Certified B Corporation, companies are required to take a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on
society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company's operations and business model impact its workers, customers, suppliers, community and the
environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company's size (number of employees), sector and location, representative indicators in
the assessment include payment above a living wage, employee benefits, stakeholder engagement, supporting underserved suppliers and environmental benefits from a
company's products or services. After completing the assessment, B Lab will verify the company's score to determine if it meets the 80-point minimum bar for
certification. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for
onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on B Lab's
website.

Designation and continued certification as a Certified B Corporation is at the sole discretion of B Lab. To maintain our certification, we are required to update
our assessment and verify our updated score with B Lab every three years. We were most recently recertified in January 2022. Our Certified B Corporation designation
remains in good standing.

**Public Benefit Corporation Status**

In connection with our Certified B Corporation status and as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission to bring ethical food to the table, we
elected in October 2017 to be treated as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law.

Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote, and its
directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation's stockholders, the best interests of
those materially affected by the corporation's conduct, and the specific public benefit or benefits identified in the certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations
organized in Delaware are also required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose to stockholders at least biennially a report detailing their success in
meeting their benefit objectives.

As provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the public benefits that we promote, and pursuant to which we manage our company, are:
(i) bringing ethically produced food to the table; (ii) bringing joy to our customers through products and services; (iii) allowing crew members to thrive in an
empowering, fun environment; (iv) fostering lasting partnerships with our farms and suppliers; (v) forging an enduring profitable business; and (vi) being stewards of
our animals, land, air and water, and being supportive of our community.

**Our Commitment to Impact**

At Vital Farms, we are dedicated to creating long-term benefits through sustainable practices for our stockholders, crew members, farmers and suppliers,
customers and consumers, communities and the environment. We promote sustainable practices and place an emphasis on being conscious environmental stewards. Our
commitment to bringing ethical food to the table has helped us to integrate sustainable practices throughout our business. Our dedication to our stakeholders inspires us
to continuously raise our standards and practices.

In 2023, we continued to make progress toward the short- and medium-term sustainability goals we first identified in December 2022. Such goals include
reducing the ecological impact of our business, driving inclusion within our crew, fostering governance accountability and mitigating climate-related risks.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has been tasked with oversight of our strategy, initiatives, policies, practices
and reporting relating to environmental sustainability, climate-related risks and opportunities, human capital management, social and ethical issues and our obligations
as a Delaware public benefit corporation. This committee receives quarterly updates from our Head of Impact and reports out to the Board of Directors regarding its
oversight responsibilities.

We are committed to building a people-first culture that embodies our values and understands the unique needs of our crew members. We will continue to hold
ourselves accountable to the important role we play in helping transition the world around us to a more diverse, equitable and inclusive place through initiatives to foster
crew learning, inclusion, and belonging that are grounded in our purposes to improve the lives of people, animals, and the planet through food. See the section titled "
Culture and Human Capital" below for further information about our commitment to a diverse crew and an inclusive work environment.

We acknowledge the potential threat that climate change may have on our business and are committed to taking action to mitigate our emissions and overall
environmental risk. In 2021, we began to track and analyze our greenhouse gas emissions to understand and mitigate our carbon footprint, as well as water risks relative
to our business and operations. We conduct an annual inventory of our greenhouse gas emissions and assessment of our climate-related risks, publishing disclosures
under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure framework.

We believe in providing transparent disclosure regarding our commitment to impact and communicating our progress with stakeholders. We released our most
recent Impact Report in March 2023 and plan to continue to provide regular updates as to our progress toward our sustainability goals. To learn more about these efforts
and our relevant policies, please visit our investor relations website: investors.vitalfarms.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website
(including information in our Impact Report) is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or any of our other filings with the SEC. We welcome our
stakeholders' feedback and can be contacted at investors@vitalfarms.com.

**Seasonality**

Demand for shell eggs and butter fluctuates in response to seasonal factors. Demand tends to increase with the start of the school year, is highest prior to holiday
periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and is lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, comparisons
of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons.

**Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property**

We own trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business, including our principal trademark, Vital Farms. All our key trademarks are
registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We believe
the protection of our trademarks, copyrights and domain names are important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on
trademark and copyright.

# Culture and Human Capital

**Our Conscious Commitment**

We are committed to prioritizing long-term benefits to each of our stakeholders, including our talented and passionate crew members, our employees, who are invaluable to our business. Prioritizing Conscious Capitalism, our business decisions consider the impact on all our stakeholders, including our crew members, and we believe this helps us to create a more sustainable and successful business.

Vital Farms is committed to fostering an environment that values collaboration, trust, and respect. Furthermore, we endeavor to provide our crew members with the resources they need to be successful through culture-enhancing programs and professional development opportunities.

We believe in cultivating meaningful opportunities, from supporting the economic well-being of the family farmers in our network to fostering a collaborative and inspiring environment for our crew members across the country.

**Crew Recruitment, Development and Retention**

Through a thoughtful and thorough selection process, we bring crew members into the business who we believe are aligned with our values and culture. We have structured our crew member orientation and onboarding processes to help foster continued alignment, including through in-person visits to our Austin headquarters and Egg Central Station processing facility, as well as fireside chats with functional leadership and substantive introductions to each business unit. The Vital Farms crew member journey, including recruiting, onboarding and each step of the career experience, is guided by the philosophy of supporting a people-first culture. We believe in enabling our crew members to grow both professionally and personally. We cultivate leaders across every level of the business and are committed to building a culture that embodies our values and understands the unique needs of our crew members. This commitment is evidenced by our investment in two new programs in 2023. The first is our new learning management system, which houses custom internal material, hands-on learning and world-class content from top universities and companies focusing on both functional and interpersonal skills, which all crew members can access. The second is a six-month blended learning program we designed and launched for all people managers across the company. Incorporating in-person, virtual and individual learning activities, this training program focuses on building strong leadership foundations and fostered strong cross-functional connection and development across our Egg Central Station and remote people leadership teams.

We believe in a culture of transparency and ownership. We communicate regularly with our crew members across departments and position levels, including through monthly all-company meetings (which are in-person for our Egg Central Station crew members) with updates and messaging from our senior leadership team, and virtual sessions for our remote teams that include executive question-and-answer sessions. In addition, we have enhanced our internal communications programs to drive engagement by adding two inclusive platforms: an expanded company intranet and crew member newsletter. These frequent touchpoints are focused on helping crew members feel connected to our mission and empowered to make informed decisions that drive our business forward.

In 2021, we transitioned to a remote workforce for our crew members outside Egg Central Station to provide our crew members greater flexibility. We continue to believe this transition has enabled us to attract top talent across the country and has had a positive impact on crew member retention and engagement.

We plan to continue to add programs and thoughtful engagement opportunities for all crew members in service of fostering an environment where crew members can do their best work and help achieve our collective goals. We are doing this by creating a performance and development ecosystem that inspires a growth mindset and unlocks crew member potential. Through creating clarity on how to be successful at Vital Farms and providing opportunities to build relevant job skills, we believe we are empowering our crew members to own their respective career journeys.

**Workplace Health and Safety**

We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our crew and have a number of features to ensure our crew members feel safe, engaged and valued. At Egg Central Station, these features include continued identification of opportunities to automate more physically challenging processes, offering subsidies to purchase slip-resistant and safety toe shoes and partnering with a local occupational health organization for regular assessment and training of Egg Central Station crew members on ergonomics. Additionally, we continue to follow protocols and take preventative measures to protect the health and safety of our crew members, customers, and communities.

## What We Value

We have defined our company values as (1) Be Humble, (2) Act Like an Owner, (3) Lead with a Growth Mindset, (4) Practice Empathy and (5) Compete to Win.
We strive to create a culture that reflects these important pillars of our business.

*   **We are Humble:** We recognize that we win and lose as a team, and we leave our egos at the door. We orient crew members towards common priorities by communicating these priorities throughout the organization. Additionally, each quarter, crew members and their managers discuss professional development and set individual goals. We hold ourselves accountable to business objectives and know that we can all improve through continuous feedback.
*   **We Act Like Owners:** We know our crew plays a critical role in our success and want them to have a stake in the outcome that they help create. We provide our crew members with competitive compensation. At our Egg Central Station facility in Springfield, Missouri, our hourly crew members are paid wages that are in excess of the living wage for an individual without children in this market. All full-time crew members are eligible for health insurance, paid parental leave, retirement contributions, employee stock purchase plan participation, equity grants and complimentary Vital Farms products.
*   **We Lead with a Growth Mindset:** We bring the drive to succeed, the desire to learn and the energy to keep raising the standards on everything we do. We offer a wealth of learning opportunities to support the development of our crew. We set the foundation with our in-depth onboarding program and then keep the momentum through self-paced courses in our online learning platform, lunch & learns lead by subject matter experts, and live courses. We level up with professional coaching, programming from esteemed external collaborators on key skills such as problem solving, and curated leadership development programs. We're focused on providing an ecosystem of developmental resources that ensure our team keeps building their skills to be successful at Vital Farms and beyond.
*   **We Practice Empathy:** We know that we get to better answers when we incorporate different perspectives and experiences into our work. We believe a diverse and inclusive crew is crucial to our long-term success as a business and a priority for us as our values remain rooted in Conscious Capitalism. Under the leadership of our Head of Inclusion and Belonging and our Inclusion and Belonging Council, we have worked to increase diversity across our crew and supply chain (including our network of family farms).
*   **We Compete to Win:** We are fierce competitors who like to win for all of our stakeholders, and we believe that prioritizing our stakeholders' long-term viability will produce stronger outcomes, for everyone, over time. Our business model is not a trade-off between purpose and profit; rather, we believe that our purpose of improving the lives of people, animals and the planet through food has always been a critical driver of our growth.

## Our Crew Members

As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 447 full-time crew members, including 251 in operations, 59 in sales and marketing, 26 in finance and 111 in general and administrative functions, all of whom are located in the United States. Of our full-time crew members, one is a contract worker. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 41% of our full-time crew members were women and approximately 23% were members of underrepresented minority groups. None of our crew members is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our crew members to be good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The following is a description of the known factors that may materially affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report. If
any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In this case, the trading price of our
common stock would likely decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
Summary of Selected Risks Associated with Our Business
Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. These risks include, among others, the following:
*   Our recent, rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to effectively manage our
    growth or evaluate our future prospects. If we fail to effectively manage our growth or evaluate our future prospects, our business could be adversely
    affected.
*   We may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability in the future.
*   Sales of shell eggs constitute the vast majority of our revenue, and a reduction in these sales would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
*   Failure to introduce successful new products, successfully enter new product categories or successfully pursue growth by other means may adversely affect
    our ability to continue to grow.
*   A substantial amount of our shell egg processing occurs at our Egg Central Station processing facility. Any damage or disruption at this facility may harm
    our business.
*   We are dependent on the market for shell eggs, and fluctuations in this market, including the decline of commodity shell egg prices relative to the price of
    our shell eggs, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
*   Fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of feed grains could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
*   If we fail to effectively expand our processing, manufacturing and production capacity as we continue to grow and scale our business, our operating results
    and brand reputation could be harmed.
*   If we fail to effectively maintain relationships within our existing farm network or further expand our farm network, our business, operating results and
    brand reputation could be harmed.
*   Future expansions of our processing capacity may not provide us with the benefits we expect to receive.
*   If we fail to effectively price our products or implement price increases, our financial condition may be adversely affected.
*   Increased transportation and freight costs or failure by our transportation providers to pick up raw materials or deliver our products on time, in compliance
    with applicable governmental regulations or at all, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact our operating results.
*   Our future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of eggs, cream for our butter
    and other raw materials that meet our standards.
*   We may not be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive market.
*   We currently have a limited number of third-party co-manufacturers and cold storage providers. The loss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or cold
    storage providers or our failure to timely identify and establish new relationships could harm our business and impede our growth.
*   Outbreaks of agricultural diseases, including avian influenza, the perception that outbreaks may occur or regulatory or market responses to outbreaks could
    reduce supply or demand for our products and harm our business.
*   We could be adversely affected by a change in consumer preferences, perception and spending habits in the natural food industry generally and with respect
    to animal-based products in particular. Any failure to develop or enrich our product offerings or gain market acceptance of our new products could have a
    negative effect on our business.
*   A limited number of distributors represent a substantial portion of our sales, and disruptions affecting our significant distributors or our relationships with
    such distributors may adversely affect our results of operations.

• We are dependent on hatcheries and pullet farms to supply our network of family farms with laying hens. Any disruption in that supply chain could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•Elevated interest rates could adversely affect our business and the ability of our family farmers to access capital.
•Consolidation of retail customers or the loss of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability.
• We source substantially all of our shell egg cartons from a sole source supplier, and any disruptions may impact our ability to sell our eggs.
•Our brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or food safety issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on
our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.
•Demand for shell eggs and butter is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which can adversely impact our results of operations in certain quarters.
•Packaging costs are volatile, have recently increased and may continue to increase, which may negatively impact our profitability, and reduced availability
of packaging supplies may otherwise impact our business.
• If we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team or other key crew members or fail to attract, train, develop and retain additional qualified
crew members to support our operations, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed.
•If we cannot maintain our company culture or focus on our purpose as we grow, our business and competitive position may be harmed.
•Disruptions in the worldwide economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
•Failure to adequately respond to stakeholder scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance issues or failure to achieve our stated impact goals
could adversely impact our reputation and brand.
•Food safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially and adversely affect our business by exposing us to
lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.
•Our operations are subject to FDA and USDA federal regulations, as well as other federal, state and local regulations, and there is no assurance that we will
be in compliance with all applicable regulations.
• We are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, contractual obligations, industry standards, policies and other
obligations related to data privacy and security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or
actions, litigation (including class claims) and mass arbitration demands, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of
revenue or profits and other adverse consequences.
•Our status as a public benefit corporation and a Certified B Corporation may not result in the benefits we anticipate, and we may be unable to maintain our
Certified B Corporation status.
• If our data or information technology systems, or the data or information technology systems of third parties upon which we rely, were compromised, we
could experience adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruption of our
business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits and other adverse consequences.
• The implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause disruption to our business, and we may not be able to effectively realize the
benefits of this new system.

**Risks Related to Our Growth and Capital Requirements**

*Our recent, rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth or
evaluate our future prospects. If we fail to effectively manage our growth or evaluate our future prospects, our business could be adversely affected.*

We have grown rapidly since inception and anticipate further growth. For example, our net revenue increased from $260.9 million in fiscal 2021 to $362.1
million in fiscal 2022 to $471.9 million in fiscal 2023. This growth has placed significant demands on our management, financial, operational, technological and other
resources. The continued growth and expansion of our business depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

⚫increase awareness of our brand and successfully compete with other companies;

18


---


# Page 20 of 100

•price our products effectively so that we are able to attract new customers and consumers and expand sales to our existing customers and consumers;
⚫expand distribution to new points of sales with new and existing customers;
⚫continue to innovate and expand our product offerings;
⚫expand our supplier, co-manufacturing, co-packing, cold storage, processing and distribution capacities;
⚫invest in and effectively implement information technology systems and related improvements to our processes and procedures; and
⚫maintain quality control over our product offerings.
The growth and expansion of our business has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and operations teams and will require
significant additional resources, financial and otherwise, to meet our needs, which may not be available in a cost-effective manner or at all. We expect to continue to
expend substantial resources on our current and future processing facilities, our sales and marketing efforts, product innovation and development and general
administration associated with being a public company.
These investments may not result in the continued growth of our business. Even if these investments do result in the growth of our business, if we do not
effectively manage our growth, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy
customer requirements or maintain high-quality product offerings, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability in the future.
Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is subject to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. As we continue to expand our operations,
we anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to increase our household
penetration, customer base, supplier network, marketing channels and product portfolio, expand and enhance our processing, manufacturing and distribution facilities,
and hire additional crew members. Our ongoing expansion efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate (including as a result of inflation, increases in input
costs or disruptions in our supply chain relating to public health pandemics, trade wars, geopolitical tensions, or other factors), and we may not succeed in increasing our
net revenue and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We have incurred significant expenses in connection with investing in our processing
capacity, our co-manufacturing and co-packing relationships, and obtaining and storing raw materials, and we will continue to incur significant expenses in developing
and marketing products. In addition, many of our expenses, including the costs associated with our existing and any future processing and manufacturing facilities, may
be fixed. We also expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as we grow and mature as a public company. If we fail to grow our revenue
at a greater rate than our costs and expenses, we may be unable to maintain or increase our profitability and may incur losses in the future.
Sales of shell eggs constitute the vast majority of our net revenue, and a reduction in these sales would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
Shell eggs accounted for approximately 92% of our net revenue in fiscal 2021, 94% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022 and 95% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023.
Shell eggs are our flagship product and have been the focal point of our sales and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of shell eggs will continue to constitute a
significant portion of our net revenue, net income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand sales,
processing and distribution of shell eggs, or that consumer and customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to
represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of our shell eggs (including consumers' election to
purchase lower-priced private-label or other economy brands during times of economic uncertainty) could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Failure to introduce successful new products, successfully enter into new product categories or successfully pursue growth by other means may adversely affect our
ability to continue to grow.

One element of our growth strategy involves the development and marketing of new products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer
preferences. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, the technical
capability of our crew members in developing and testing product prototypes, our ability to comply with applicable governmental regulations, and the success of our
management, sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products, including through current and new product categories. There can be no assurance
that we will successfully develop and market new products or successfully introduce products in new categories. The development and introduction of new products
requires substantial marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we introduce new or
improved products that ultimately do not meet objectives for such products, it could impact our growth, sales and profitability. Any failure to successfully develop,
market and launch future products or successfully enter into new product categories may lead to decreased growth, sales and profitability.

Further risks are presented if we elect to pursue continued growth or enter new product categories by means other than new product introductions, including by
acquisitions or investments in business or technologies that we believe could offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of such opportunities may divert the attention of
management. Furthermore, it may cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing such transactions, regardless of whether such
opportunities are realized. Such acquisitions, transactions or investments may also result in potentially dilutive equity issuances, the incurrence of debt or contingent
liabilities or challenges with integration, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted
growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.

Our estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts included in this Annual Report and elsewhere, including in connection with the long-term financial
goals we announced in 2023, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, particularly in light of
economic uncertainties. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular
number or percentage of customers covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any
expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our products and those of our competitors. Even if the
market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to
many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our forecasts of market growth
should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.

We may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and the failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to
delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations.

We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, draws on our Credit Facility and sales of our products. We have incurred
and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the expansion of our processing capacity. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources
for the foreseeable future as we consider additional markets we may choose to pursue and other growth opportunities.

We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash provided by our operating activities and available borrowings
under our existing credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to
seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. We may also seek financing in connection with potential
new product introductions or acquisitions or investments in businesses or technologies that we believe could offer growth opportunities. Such financings may result in
dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek
additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.
Our ability to access additional capital may further be affected by adverse or uncertain economic conditions. Weakness and volatility in the capital markets and
the economy in general could make it more difficult to access the capital markets and could increase our cost of borrowing.

The agreements governing our Credit Facility require us to meet certain covenants, which could restrict our operational and financial flexibility.

The Credit Facility provides for a revolving line of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive
covenants, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The restrictive covenants in the Credit Facility limit our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, incur
liens, enter into fundamental changes such as mergers or consolidations, change our fiscal year or substantially change the nature of our business. The Credit Facility
also requires us to maintain three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement. These provisions
may affect our ability to pursue business opportunities we find attractive or to maintain flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our Credit Facility or other terms of any present or future indebtedness could result in an event of default under such
indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the lender or lenders under such indebtedness declaring all obligations, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, immediately due and payable and taking control of any collateral securing such indebtedness. This may require us to amend or refinance our indebtedness on
less favorable terms.

If we are forced to amend or refinance the Credit Facility on less favorable terms or are unable to do so at all, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness and may not be able to repay the
amounts due thereunder. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Risks Related to Our Business, Our Brand, Our Products and Our Industry

A substantial amount of our shell egg processing occurs at our Egg Central Station processing facility. Any damage or disruption at this facility may harm our
business.

A substantial amount of our shell egg processing occurs at our Egg Central Station shell egg processing facility. Any shutdown or period of reduced production
at Egg Central Station, which may be caused by regulatory noncompliance or other issues, as well as factors beyond our control, such as natural disaster, weather, fire,
power interruption, work stoppage, disease outbreaks or pandemics, equipment failure or delay in raw materials delivery, would significantly disrupt our ability to
deliver our products in a timely manner, meet our contractual obligations and operate our business. Further, the processing equipment used for our shell eggs is costly to
replace or repair, particularly because certain of such equipment is sourced internationally. We have at times seen pricing and capacity constraints related to
internationally sourced equipment, and our equipment supply chains may be further disrupted in connection with public health pandemics, geopolitical tensions and
wars (such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East), inflation, trade wars or other factors. If any material amount
of our machinery were damaged, we could be unable to predict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery or find co-manufacturers with suitable
alternative machinery, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The property and business disruption insurance we maintain
for Egg Central Station may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

We are dependent on the market for shell eggs, and fluctuations in this market, including the decline of commodity shell egg prices relative to the price of our shell
eggs, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We contract with family farms to purchase all of their egg production for the duration of our contracts. We are contractually obligated to purchase these eggs
irrespective of our ability to sell such eggs. Periodically in our industry, there has been an oversupply of eggs, which has caused egg prices to contract, sometimes
substantially so, and as a result we have sold or donated our excess supply at reduced prices or no cost. If we are unable to sell such eggs upon commercially reasonable
terms, or at all, our gross margins, business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Conversely, there have at times in recent periods been
supply shortages in the egg industry, with supply impacted by, among other things, avian influenza, increased demand for eggs and increases in feed and other input
costs. Such supply shortages, together with price increases we or others in the industry have implemented or choose to implement in the future, could result in declining
consumer demand for shell eggs or inability to fulfill customer demand, each of which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results and
operations.

We sell shell eggs to consumers at a premium price point, and when prices for commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our shell eggs (including due to
price increases we may implement or supply expansions in the market for commodity shell eggs), price-sensitive consumers may choose to purchase commodity shell
eggs offered by our competitors at a greater velocity than, or instead of, our shell eggs. As a result, low commodity shell egg prices relative to the price of our shell eggs
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also sell a small percentage of our shell eggs to wholesalers and egg breaking plants at commodity shell egg prices, which fluctuate widely and are outside
our control. Small increases in production or small decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on the prices at which these eggs are sold.

Fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of feed grains could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

The price we pay to purchase shell eggs from farmers fluctuates based on pallet weight and is also adjusted quarterly for changes in feed cost, which may cause
our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition, including our gross margin
and profitability, fluctuate based on the cost and supply of commodities, including corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients.

Although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources, we have little, if any, control over the prices of these ingredients, which are affected by
weather, speculators, export restrictions, various supply and demand factors, geopolitical tensions, inflation, transportation and storage costs, and agricultural and energy
policies in the United States and internationally. We have seen increased prices for conventional and organic corn and soybean crops on a global basis, including
increased prices resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war and measures taken in response thereto, inflation and supply chain shortages. It is possible that ongoing conflicts
in the Middle East and elsewhere may have similar effects. We have entered into commodity derivative instrument contracts related to conventional feed ingredients. If
we are unable to successfully conduct this program to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations, our financial condition and results of operations may be
impacted.

We may not be able to increase our product prices enough or in a timely manner to sufficiently offset increased commodity costs due to consumer price
sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors and, in many cases, our retailers may not accept a price increase or may require price increases to occur after a
specified period of time elapses. Over time, if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, are unable to offset operating cost increases with continuous
improvement savings or are unsuccessful in our current or any future commodity derivative instrument program, then commodity price volatility or increases could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to effectively expand our processing, manufacturing and production capacity as we continue to grow and scale our business, our operating results and
brand reputation could be harmed.

While our current supply, processing and manufacturing capabilities are sufficient to meet our present business needs, we are planning to expand these
capabilities in the future as we continue to grow and scale our business. For example, in fiscal 2022 we completed an expansion of Egg Central Station, our shell egg
processing facility in Springfield, Missouri, to increase our capacity for the distribution of shell eggs. Additionally, we announced that we had begun the design and the
site selection process for our next egg packing center. There is risk in our ability to effectively continue to scale production and processing and manage our supply chain
requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for our products in order to ensure we have adequate processing and manufacturing capacity to effectively allocate
product supply across our stock keeping units.

Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions that, if inaccurate, may affect our ability to maintain adequate processing and manufacturing capacities (or co-
processing and co-manufacturing capacities) in order to meet the demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. If we fail
to meet demand for our products and, as a result, consumers who have previously purchased our products may buy other brands and our retail customers may allocate
shelf space to other brands, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

On the other hand, if we overestimate our demand or overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized supply or other assets and may experience
reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our processing and manufacturing capabilities with demand, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

If we fail to effectively maintain relationships within our existing farm network or further expand our farm network, our business, operating results and brand
reputation could be harmed.

We source our eggs from our network of family farms, which is the foundation of our supply chain. The cream for our butter is sourced from a network of
family farms contracted by our butter supplier. If we are unable to maintain and expand this supply chain because of actions taken by farmers or other events outside of
our control (including the failure of our butter supplier to maintain or expand its contracted farm network), we may be unable to timely supply distributors and customers
with our products, which could lead to cancellation of purchase orders, damage to our commercial relationships and impairment of our brand. For example, we require
our egg farmers to build and equip their farms to certain specifications, which requires a significant upfront capital investment, and any inability of farmers to obtain
adequate financing on acceptable terms, including due to elevated interest rates, would impair their ability to contract with us. These and other factors, including
economic uncertainty, may make it more difficult for us to recruit and attract new farmers to our network in a number sufficient to meet product demand.

There are a number of factors that could impair our relationship with farmers, many of which are outside of our control. While we strive to operate our business
in a manner that drives long-term and sustainable benefits for our stakeholders, including our farmers, we may make strategic decisions that our farmers disagree with
and which could cause farmers to terminate their relationships with us. Reputational harm resulting from impairment of our relationship with existing farmers may also
make it more difficult to attract new farmers to expand our network. If our relationship with our existing or future farmers is disrupted due to these or other factors, we
may not be able to sustain the supply necessary to meet customer and consumer demand for our products, which would negatively impact our operating results. Any
failure to maintain or expand our farm network would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to effectively price our products or implement price increases, our financial condition may be adversely affected.
The prices of our products are driven by a number of factors, including supply constraints, customer and consumer demand, inflation, input costs and market
conditions. In response to such conditions, we increased prices on certain of our products at times during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. While we have not yet
seen significant decreases in sales volume due to such price increases, if we further increase prices, we could experience declining demand for our products, decreased
ability to attract new customers and lower sales volumes. If price increases result in a greater spread between the price of our products and the price of conventional or
private-label products, consumers may be less willing to pay a premium for our products, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. Additionally, our retail
customers may not accept such price increases or may require increased promotional activity. If we cannot effectively price our products or carry out price increases, our
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
Increased transportation and freight costs or failure by our transportation providers to pick up raw materials or deliver our products on time, in compliance with
applicable governmental regulations or at all, have adversely impact and are expected to continue to adversely impact our operating results.
We rely upon third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our raw material transportation and product shipments. Our utilization of pickup and
delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, driver shortages, trucking capacity limitations due to general increases in freight
demand, employee and contractor strikes or unavailability (including due to disease outbreaks and pandemics) or inclement weather, any of which could increase our
transportation and freight costs. For example, due in part to increased labor costs and rising fuel costs due to international tensions and wars (including due to attacks on
container ships in the Red Sea), we have seen at times during recent periods increased transportation and freight costs. Further increases in transportation and freight
costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production on a profitable basis and could therefore adversely affect our operating results. We
may not be able to price our products in a manner that sufficiently offsets increased transportation costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our
competitors, and in many cases, our retail customers may not accept a price increase or may require price increases to occur after a specified period of time elapses. In
addition, if we increase prices to offset higher transportation and freight costs, we could experience lower demand for our products, decreased ability to attract new
customers and lower sales volumes.
Furthermore, noncompliance by our third-party transportation providers with applicable regulatory requirements may impact the ability of providers to provide
delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. Due to increased costs or noncompliance by our transportation providers with applicable regulatory
requirements, we may change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties with any such change that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we
could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-
party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.

Our future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of eggs, cream for our butter and
other raw materials that meet our standards.
Our ability to ensure a continued supply of eggs, cream for our butter and other raw materials for our products at competitive prices depends on many factors
beyond our control. In particular, we rely on the farms that supply us with eggs and cream to implement controls and procedures to manage the risk of exposing animals
to harmful diseases, but outbreaks may occur despite their efforts. An outbreak of disease could result in increased government restriction on the sale and distribution of
our products, and negative publicity could impact customer and consumer perception of our products, even if an outbreak does not directly impact the animals from
which we source our products. Our farm network for our shell eggs is in a geographic region we refer to as the Pasture Belt, which is a term we use that refers to the U.S.
region where the weather is conducive to hens being outside as much as possible. The dairy farms that supply our cream are primarily located in Ireland. The occurrence
of a natural disaster in any of these regions could have a significant negative impact on us, the farmers and our supply chain. Additionally, the animals from which our
products are sourced, the crops on which we rely for feed and the pastures on which these animals are raised are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural
disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Disease, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can adversely impact pasture
quantity and quality, leading to reduced yields and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, our raw materials. If we raised
prices for our products to account for this increase, we could experience decreased demand for our products and lower sales volumes, thereby adversely affecting our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We also compete with other food companies in the procurement of eggs and cream, and this competition may increase in the future if consumer demand increases
for these items or products containing them or if competitors increasingly offer products in these market sectors. If supplies of eggs and cream that meet our quality
standards are reduced or are in greater demand, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply to meet our needs on favorable terms or at all.
Our supply may also be affected by the number and size of farms that raise chickens and cows that meet our standards, changes in U.S. and global economic
conditions and our ability to forecast our raw materials requirements. For example, in order to meet our standards, we require our egg farms to invest in infrastructure at
the outset of our relationship. The typical upfront investment for each of the farms is significant, and many farmers seek financing assistance from local and regional
banks as well as federal government loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, Farm Service Agency. Changes in U.S. and global economic conditions,
elevated interest rates or a U.S. government shutdown could significantly affect the loans available to farmers. Many of these farmers have alternative income
opportunities and the relative financial performance of raising chickens in accordance with our standards as compared to other potentially more profitable opportunities
could affect their interest in working with us. Any of these factors could impact our ability to supply our products to distributors and customers and may adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive market.
We compete with large egg companies such as Cal-Maine, Inc. and large international food companies such as Ornua Co-operative Limited (Kerrygold). We also
compete with local and regional egg and dairy companies, as well as private-label products processed by other egg and dairy companies. These competitors may have
substantially greater financial and other resources than us, and some of our competitors' products are well accepted in the marketplace today. Such competitors may also
have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer comparable or substitute products to customers at lower costs. This could put pressure on us to lower
our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to reduce prices. Conversely, if we were to increase prices,
including as a result of fluctuations in the shell egg market, increased commodity or raw material costs, increased packaging or transportation costs or otherwise, any
resulting decline in consumer demand for our products may be exacerbated by the competitiveness of our market.
Generally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than we have. We cannot be certain
that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources. Conventional food companies may acquire our
competitors or launch their own egg and butter products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in
consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products
under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices, and may change the merchandising of our products so they have less favorable placement.
Larger competitors may also be less affected by economic disruption and uncertainty, including with respect to inflation, global economic conditions or agricultural
diseases such as avian influenza, than we are. These competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing
and advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which could adversely affect our margins and could result in a
decrease in our operating results and profitability.

Failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private-label products, especially during an economic downturn, may adversely affect our
profitability.

We compete not only with other well-advertised nationally branded products, but also with private-label products. Such private-label products generally are sold
at lower prices than our products. Consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than
less expensive alternatives. If the difference in perceived value between our brands and private-label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing,
consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. In periods of economic uncertainty, particularly in periods of uncertainty driven by
high inflation, consumers may purchase more often from lower-priced private-label or other economy brands. To the extent this occurs, we could experience a decrease
in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, our foodservice product sales will be reduced if
consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers, including as a result of public health pandemics or economic
uncertainty driven by inflation or other factors.
We currently have a limited number of third-party co-manufacturers and cold storage providers. The loss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or cold storage
providers or our failure to timely identify and establish new relationships with new co-manufacturers or cold storage providers could harm our business and impede
our growth.
A significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers. We currently rely on two
co-manufacturers for hard-boiled eggs, one co-manufacturer for bulk butter production, two co-manufacturers for stick butter, one co-manufacturer for liquid eggs, and
one co-packer for certain shell egg processing. While we currently have a written manufacturing contract with one of our co-manufacturers for hard-boiled eggs, we do
not currently have written manufacturing contracts with our other co-manufacturers or with our co-packer for certain shell egg processing. Due to the absence of written
contracts with certain of our co-manufacturers, these co-manufacturers can generally seek to alter or terminate their relationships with us at any time, resulting in periods
during which we may have limited or no ability to manufacture certain of our products.
In addition, due to the limited number of co-manufacturers, any interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which
may be caused by work stoppages, regulatory issues or noncompliance, disease outbreaks or pandemics, war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other weather or
natural disasters, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations until such time as the interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured, especially in times of low inventory.
We believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in our industry that meet our geographical requirements and our strict quality
and control standards, and should we seek to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be
able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any
failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products and product extensions could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we rely on a limited number of cold storage providers to store our products. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to obtain
adequate cold storage facilities services in a timely manner. We are not assured of continued cold storage capacities. Certain of our cold storage providers could
discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. In addition, we are not assured of sufficient capacities of these providers commensurate with increased product
demand.
Outbreaks of agricultural diseases, including avian influenza, the perception that outbreaks may occur or regulatory or market responses to outbreaks could reduce
supply or demand for our products and harm our business.
Our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including pests and diseases such as avian influenza, the occurrence of which can materially
and adversely affect the quality and quantity of products, including shell eggs, that we distribute. Since the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in
early 2022, we have been closely following the progression of the virus. To date, we have experienced outbreaks at four of our farms, one located in Missouri, one in
Tennessee and two in Kansas. While we have not experienced material disruptions to our egg supply due to such outbreaks, if a substantial portion of our farms or
production facilities were affected by an outbreak of HPAI, or a disease like it, this could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Additionally, outbreaks of HPAI or similar diseases could limit our ability to utilize co-packers for our shell eggs due to increased biosecurity
measures that may be implemented by such co-packers in the event of an outbreak.
25

# Page 27 of 100

Even if our farms and production facilities were not directly impacted by avian disease, we may nevertheless be negatively affected by resulting governmental
restrictions on our operations and the sale and distribution of our products, as well as negative publicity and impacted consumer perceptions for our industry. Such
impacts could result in decreased consumer demand for our products and impact our operating results. Additionally, certain states in which our family farms are located
have at times recommended or required that farms keep hens indoors to help limit exposure to avian influenza. Prolonged requirements to keep our hens indoors could
adversely impact consumer perception of our egg products in comparison to those of our competitors, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial
condition and operating results.
We could be adversely affected by a change in consumer preferences, perception and spending habits in the natural food industry generally and with respect to
animal-based products, in particular. Any failure to develop or enrich our product offerings or gain market acceptance of our new products could have a negative
effect on our business.
We have positioned our brand to capitalize on growing consumer interest in natural, clean-label, traceable, ethically produced, great-tasting and nutritious foods.
The market in which we operate is subject to changes in consumer preference, perception and spending habits. Our performance depends significantly on factors that
may affect the level and pattern of consumer spending in the U.S. natural food industry market in which we operate. Such factors include consumer preference,
consumer confidence, consumer income, consumer perception of the safety and quality of our products and shifts in the perceived value for our products relative to
alternatives. Media coverage regarding the safety or quality of, or diet or health issues relating to, our products or the raw materials, ingredients or processes involved in
their manufacturing may damage consumer confidence in our products. A general decline in the consumption of our products could occur at any time as a result of
changes in consumer preference, perception, confidence and spending habits, including an unwillingness to pay a premium or an inability to purchase our products due
to financial hardship or increased price sensitivity, which may be exacerbated by economic uncertainty and general inflationary trends. For example, we and many of our
customers face pressure from animal rights groups to require all companies that supply food products to operate their business in a manner that treats animals in
conformity with certain standards developed or approved by these animal rights groups. If consumer preferences shift away from animal-based products for these
reasons, because of a preference for plant-based products or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
The success of our products depends on a number of factors, including our ability to accurately anticipate changes in market demand and consumer preferences,
our ability to differentiate the quality of our products from those of our competitors, and the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns for our products.
We may not be successful in identifying trends in consumer preferences and developing products that respond to such trends in a timely manner. We also may not be
able to effectively promote our products by our marketing and advertising campaigns and gain market acceptance. If our products fail to gain market acceptance, are
restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, we may not be able to fully recover costs and expenses incurred in our operation, and our business,
financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
A limited number of distributors represent a substantial portion of our sales, and disruptions affecting our significant distributors or our relationships with such
distributors may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our products are distributed through a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who in turn sell our
products to consumers. We serve the majority of natural channel customers through food distributors, such as United Natural Foods, Inc., or UNFI, which purchase,
store, sell and deliver our products to retailer customers.
In fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023, UNFI (which was Whole Foods' primary distributor other than from January to August 2021) accounted for approximately
18%, 26% and 25% of our net revenue, respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retail grocers or foodservice providers, who
generally select the distributors, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with distributors that ensure future
sales of our products. These distributors are able to decide on the products carried, and they may limit the products available for our retail customers to purchase. We
expect that most of our sales will be made through a core number of distributors for the foreseeable future. The loss of one or more of our significant distributor
relationships that cannot be replaced in a timely manner, under similar terms and conditions or at all could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
We are dependent on hatcheries and pullet farms to supply our network of family farms with laying hens. Any disruption in that supply chain could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Under the terms of our contracts with our network of family farms, while we do not own laying hens, we are generally responsible for coordinating the
acquisition and delivery of laying hens to the farmers. In order to meet these obligations, we place orders for chicks directly with hatcheries intended to supply a future
year's production of eggs at least a year in advance. Once the chicks are hatched, they are delivered to a network of pullet farms, who rear the chicks to approximately
16 to 18 weeks of age, at which time they are delivered to our network of family farms to begin laying eggs.
26

---


# Page 28 of 100

We work primarily with several pullet hatcheries that deliver chicks to a network of independent pullet farms. We do not have long-term supply contracts with
these suppliers, and if a substantial portion of our current hatcheries or pullet farms were to cease doing business with us for any reason, we may have a difficult time
finding and contracting with alternate hatcheries or pullet farms in sufficient scale to meet our needs, if at all. Pullet farms may also be subject to capacity constraints,
and if we are unable to find independent pullet farms with sufficient capacity to receive chicks from our hatcheries, we may be unable to fulfill our customer
commitments. Additionally, any disruption in the supply of laying hens for any reason, including agricultural disease such as avian influenza, natural disaster, fire, power
interruption, work stoppage or other calamity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we cannot replace
these providers in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all.

*Elevated interest rates could adversely affect our business and the ability of our family farmers to access capital.*

Our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability of credit and the terms of and increases in interest rates. These changes
could cause our cost of doing business to increase and limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities. Disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead
to a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or reduction in the availability
of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve planned growth and operating results.

Elevated interest rates may also adversely impact the ability of our family farmers to access capital. We require our egg farmers to build and equip their farms to
certain specifications, which requires a significant upfront capital investment, and any inability of farmers to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms, including as
a result of elevated interest rates, would impair their ability to partner with us. If our relationship with these egg farmers is disrupted, we may not be able to fully recover
our investments in birds and feed, which would negatively impact our operating results.

*Consolidation of retail customers or the loss of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability.*

Our retail customers include natural channel and mainstream channel stores, which have been undergoing consolidation in recent years. This consolidation has
produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, operate with lower inventories,
decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private-label products, all of which could negatively impact our business.

With certain of our retail customers, like Whole Foods, we sell our products through distributors. We are not able to precisely attribute our net revenue to a
specific retailer for products sold through distributors. We rely on third-party data to calculate the portion of retail sales attributable to retailers, but this data is inherently
imprecise because it is based on gross sales generated by our products sold at retailers, without accounting for price concessions, promotional activities or chargebacks,
and because it measures retail sales for only the portion of our retailers serviced through distributors. Based on this third-party data and internal analysis, Whole Foods
accounted for approximately 25%, 23% and 23% of our retail sales in fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Kroger accounted for approximately 12%, 12% and
11% of our retail sales in the fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The loss of Whole Foods, Kroger or any other large retail customer, or the reduction of
purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from any such customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability.

A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business
strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channel segments, our retail
customers sometimes compete for the same consumers. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that
negatively affect us. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers.

We source substantially all of our shell egg cartons from a sole source supplier, and any disruptions may impact our ability to sell our eggs.
We obtain substantially all of the packaging for our shell eggs from a sole source supplier. Any disruption in the supply of our shell egg cartons, including due to
interruptions to global shipping, could delay our production and hinder our ability to meet our commitments to customers. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity
of our packaging on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources, sales of our products could be delayed or we
may be required to redesign our products. For example, in connection with increased demand for shell eggs in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the supplier
of substantially all of our shell egg cartons began to prioritize packaging for core egg products (such as 12-count packages), and we separately experienced certain
quality issues with our 18-count egg cartons. As a result of these events, and in order to otherwise meet demand for our products, we began using recycled plastic
packaging for certain of our shell egg products. While this change in packaging did not materially impact our operations, there is no guarantee that we will not
experience similar packaging issues in the future, or that any such packaging issues will not impact our ability to meet product demand for our shell eggs. For example,
consumers may be less likely to accept products packaged using certain materials, or modified packaging may make it more difficult for consumers to locate our
products in stores. Any of these events could result in lost sales, price increases, reduced gross margins or damage to our customer or consumer relationships, which
would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or food safety issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.
We believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to
comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our
competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Our products may be subject to contamination by foreign materials or disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as salmonella and E. coli. These
organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more could be present in our products, either as a result of food
processing or as an inherent risk based on the nature of our products. These organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper
handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. These risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to current good
manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and finished product testing. Shipment of contaminated products, even if inadvertent, could result in a violation of law and lead to
increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies, penalties and adverse publicity. In
addition, products purchased from other producers, including co-manufacturers, could contain contaminants that we might inadvertently redistribute.
If our products become contaminated, or if there is a potential health risk associated with our products, we or our co-manufacturers might decide or need to recall
a product. Any product recall could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products and adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers. For
example, in December 2019, our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility, including
ours, due to potential listeria contamination at the production facility. In connection with the recall, our co-manufacturer elected to permanently close the affected
production facility and move all production to a different facility. As a result, we were unable to supply customers with hard-boiled eggs for a period of time in the first
quarter of fiscal 2020, which led to the loss of certain customer accounts for this product, the revenues from which were immaterial in the aggregate.
We also have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. For example, consumers may store our products under conditions and for periods of
time inconsistent with USDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other governmental guidelines, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our
products.
If consumers do not perceive our products to be of high quality or safe, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations
and financial condition would be adversely affected. Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the quality and safety of our products would be difficult and
costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our market positioning as a socially conscious purveyor of high-quality products and may
significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and
operating results. Further, the growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or
misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and
reputation. If we do not maintain a favorable perception of our brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We must expend resources to maintain consumer awareness of our brand, build brand loyalty and generate interest in our products. Our marketing strategies and
channels will evolve, and our programs may or may not be successful.
In order to remain competitive and expand and keep shelf placement for our products, we have increased and may continue to increase our marketing and
advertising spending to maintain and increase consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products, which could impact our
operating results. Further advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve our brand's market position or to introduce new products to
the market, and participants in our industry are increasingly engaging with non-traditional media, including consumer outreach through social media and web-based
channels, which may not prove successful.
Increases in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation or lead to increased brand awareness. Further, social media platforms
frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user's search and may make other changes to the way results are displayed, or
may increase the costs of such advertising, which can negatively affect the placement of our links and, therefore, reduce the number of visits to our website and social
media channels or make such marketing cost prohibitive. In addition, social media platforms typically require compliance with their policies and procedures, which may
be subject to change or new interpretation with limited ability to negotiate, which could negatively impact our marketing capabilities. If we are unable to maintain and
promote a favorable perception of our brand and products on a cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
If we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.
We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on
our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Vital Farms brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other
factors, the success of our product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, our continued focus on animal welfare, the
environment and sustainability and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality consumer and customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its
accuracy, could have an adverse effect on our business. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our
consumers, customers, farmers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including changes to our products or packaging, adverse publicity or a governmental investigation,
litigation or regulatory enforcement action, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business.
If we fail to cost-effectively acquire new consumers or retain our existing consumers, our business could be adversely affected.
Our success and our ability to increase revenue and operate profitably depend in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new consumers, retain existing
consumers and keep existing consumers engaged so that they continue to purchase our products. While we intend to continue to invest significantly in sales and
marketing to educate consumers about our brand, our values and our products, there is no assurance that these efforts will generate further demand for our products or
expand our consumer base. Our ability to attract new consumers and retain our existing consumers depends on the perceived value and quality of our products,
consumers' desire to purchase ethically produced products at a premium, offerings of our competitors, our ability to offer new and relevant products and the
effectiveness of our marketing efforts, among other items. For example, because our shell eggs are sold to consumers at a premium price point, when prices for
commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our shell eggs, we may be unable to entice price-sensitive consumers to try our products. We may also lose loyal
consumers to our competitors if we are unable to meet consumer demand in a timely manner. If we are unable to cost-effectively acquire new consumers, retain existing
consumers and keep existing consumers engaged, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.
Our sales and profits are dependent upon our ability to expand existing customer relationships and acquire new customers.
Our business depends on our ability to increase our household penetration, to expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers, to grow
within the foodservice channel and to strengthen our product offerings through innovation in both new and existing categories. Any strategies we employ to pursue this
growth are subject to numerous factors outside of our control. For example, retailers continue to aggressively market their private-label products, which could reduce
demand for our products. The expansion of our business also depends on our ability over the long term to obtain customers in additional distribution channels, such as
convenience, drugstore, club, military and international markets. Any growth in distribution channels may also affect our existing customer relationships and present
additional challenges, including related to pricing strategies. Additionally, we may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing and promotional activities, such
as rebates, temporary price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities, and these expenditures are subject to
risks, including related to consumer acceptance of our efforts. Our failure to obtain new customers, or expand our business with existing customers, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Demand for shell eggs and butter is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which can adversely impact our results of operations in certain quarters.
Demand for shell eggs and butter fluctuates in response to seasonal factors. Demand tends to increase with the start of the school year and is highest prior to
holiday periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations,
comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons. If we are not correct in
predicting our future shell egg demand, we may experience a supply and demand shell egg imbalance. This imbalance between supply and demand can adversely impact
our results of operations at certain times of the year.
Packaging costs are volatile, have recently increased and may continue to increase, which may negatively impact our profitability, and reduced availability of
packaging supplies may otherwise impact our business.
Costs of packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions,
consumer demand and changes in governmental trade. We saw higher packaging costs in fiscal year 2022, and these elevated costs continued in fiscal year 2023.
Volatility in the prices of supplies we and our co-manufacturers purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, although we have not
seen significant decreases in volume due to previous price increases, we may not be able to implement further price increases for our products to cover any increased
costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower consumer demand, decreased ability to attract new customers and lower sales volumes.
Additionally, if the availability of certain packaging supplies is limited due to factors beyond our control (including as a result of the public health pandemics or
disruptions to global supply chains), or if packaging supplies do not meet our standards, we may make changes to our product packaging, which could negatively impact
the perception of our brand. For example, in connection with increased demand for shell eggs in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the supplier of
substantially all of our shell egg cartons began to prioritize packaging for core egg products (such as 12-count packages), and we separately experienced certain quality
issues with our 18-count egg cartons. As a result of these events, and in order to otherwise meet demand for our products, we began using recycled plastic packaging for
certain of our shell egg products. If we are not successful in managing our packaging costs or the supply of packaging that meets our standards to use for our products, if
we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, any of these factors could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
Our net revenue and earnings may fluctuate as a result of price actions, promotional activities and chargebacks.
Retailers may require price concessions that would negatively impact our margins and our profitability. Alternatively, we may increase our prices to offset
commodity inflation and potentially impact our margins and volume. In addition, we periodically offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and
consumers, including rebates, temporary price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities.
Additionally, while we continue to work to optimize supply chain logistics, we are occasionally charged fees and/or fines by retailers for various delivery and
order discrepancies. While we challenge and vet these charges, we may be subject to such charges that could be detrimental to our performance, particularly when
combined with the effects of increased freight costs or the other risks outlined in this section. The cost associated with promotions and chargebacks is estimated and
recorded as a reduction in net revenue. These price concessions, promotional activities and chargebacks could adversely impact our net revenue and changes in such
activities could adversely impact period-over-period results. If we are not correct in predicting the performance of promotions, or if we are not correct in estimating
chargebacks, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
If we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team or other key crew members or fail to attract, train, develop and retain additional qualified crew
members to support our operations, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed.
Our success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers as well as our other key crew members. These executives and
key crew members are primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand,
culture and the reputation we enjoy with farmers, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. From time to time, there may be changes in our
executive management team or other key crew members resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, or
the failure by our executive team to effectively work with our crew members and lead our company, could harm our business.

In addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train, develop and retain a sufficient number of crew members who understand and appreciate
our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. If we are unable to win in a competitive market
for top talent capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. For example, in Springfield, Missouri, where Egg
Central Station is located, there is a tight labor market. As a result of this tight labor market, we may be unable to attract and retain crew members with the skills we
require. Additionally, substantially all of our crew members outside of Egg Central Station are working remotely on a permanent basis. Although we believe we manage
our operations to handle remote working conditions efficiently, it is possible that such remote work arrangements could adversely impact crew member cohesiveness,
efficiency, professional development, operational agility and retention. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our crew
members may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we cannot maintain our company culture or focus on our purpose as we grow, our business and competitive position may be harmed.
We believe our culture and our purpose have been key contributors to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a
sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our crew members. Any failure to preserve our culture or focus on our purpose could negatively affect our ability to retain and
recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we continue to grow and develop the infrastructure
of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important values. We may also have difficulty maintaining our company culture as substantially all of our
crew members outside of Egg Central Station are working remotely on a permanent basis. If we fail to maintain our company culture or focus on our purpose, our
business and competitive position may be harmed.
Our operations are geographically consolidated. A major tornado or other natural disaster within the region in which we operate could seriously disrupt our entire
business.
Egg Central Station, our shell egg processing facility, is located in Springfield, Missouri. This facility and our network of family farms supporting our shell egg
business are concentrated in the Midwestern portion of the Pasture Belt. The majority of cream for our butter is sourced from farms in Ireland. The impact of natural
disasters such as tornadoes, drought or flood within these areas is difficult to predict, particularly given the potential of climate change to increase the frequency and
intensity of such natural disasters, but a natural disaster could seriously disrupt our entire business. Our insurance may not adequately cover our losses and expenses in
the event of a natural disaster. As a result, natural disasters within these areas could lead to substantial losses.
Our inability to maintain our GFSI and SQF Select Site certifications may negatively affect our reputation.
The Safe Quality Food Institute administers the SQF Program, which is a third-party auditing program that examines and certifies food producers with respect to
certain aspects of the producer's business, including food safety, quality control and social, environmental and occupational health and safety management systems. The
SQF Select Site certification is one of a number of available SQF certifications and involves both auditing for food safety issues and unannounced inspections by SQF
personnel on an annual basis.
The Global Food Safety Initiative, or GFSI, is a private organization established and managed by The Consumer Goods Forum, an international trade association.
GFSI operates a benchmarking scheme whereby certification bodies, such as the SQF Program, are "recognized" as meeting certain criteria maintained by GFSI. GFSI
itself does not certify or accredit entities in the food industry.
SQF Select Site certification and the GFSI recognition of the SQF Program do not themselves have any independent legal significance and do not necessarily
signal regulatory compliance. As a practice matter, however, certain retailers, including some of our largest customers, require SQF certification or certification by
another GFSI-recognized program as a condition for doing business. Loss of SQF Select Site certification could impair our ability to do business with these customers,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to Socioeconomic, Political and Environmental Factors
Disruptions in the worldwide economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Adverse and uncertain economic conditions, including uncertainty related to inflation, market volatility, outbreaks of contagious disease or pandemics,
geopolitical tensions and wars, including the Russia-Ukraine war and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, or disruption in global financial and credit markets due to
uncertainty in the banking system or bank failures may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. In addition, our ability to manage
normal commercial relationships with our farmers, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may
shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings, including private-label products, during economic downturns, and an economic downturn may cause
customers to be less receptive to price increases on our products.
Adverse economic conditions may also affect our farmers. For example, recent inflationary pressures have resulted in increased costs for our farmers to build,
equip and operate their farms. If our relationship with our existing farmers, or our ability to attract new farmers, is disrupted due to economic conditions or otherwise,
our operating results may be adversely affected. Further, our foodservice product sales will be reduced if consumers reduce the amount of food they consume away from
home at our foodservice customers, including as a result of inflationary concerns or other economic uncertainty. Distributors and customers may become more
conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and
increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailer and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers
and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our sales and
profitability.
In addition, historically, our deposit accounts have held deposits in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. In the
event of a bank failure at any of the institutions where we maintain deposits, there can be no assurance that regulators will agree to guarantee such deposits above and
beyond amounts insured by the FDIC.
Disruptions in international trade, including disruptions due to global health pandemics and geopolitical tensions, may have a material adverse impact on us, our
suppliers and our network of farms, including our ability to expand our operations as planned.
The COVID-19 pandemic, other global health pandemics, the Russia-Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East and other geopolitical tensions have disrupted
international trade, resulting in increased shipping costs and delays in the import and export of goods to and from the United States and other countries. Specifically, the
increased demand for international shipping has resulted in shortages of shipping containers and delays at international ports. Currently, we import cream for our butter
from a supplier in Ireland, which may result in increased costs or shipment delays due to the recent disruptions in the international trade markets. Additionally, we, our
suppliers and our network of family farms are dependent on equipment and other supplies imported from Europe and other locations. To the extent that disruptions to
global shipping, including disruptions due to global health pandemics or geopolitical tensions or wars, negatively impact our, our suppliers' and our network of family
farms' ability to access necessary goods, we may not be able to expand our operations as planned, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would
be materially and adversely affected.
We and certain of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to produce certain of the products we sell. Any event causing a sudden disruption of
manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries, including changes in the Unites States' foreign trade policies resulting in the imposition of additional import
restrictions, withdrawal from or material modifications to, international trade agreements, unanticipated political changes, increased customs duties or tariffs, labor
disputes, health epidemics, adverse weather conditions, crop failure, acts of war or terrorism, legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers' ability to produce and
deliver products, and natural disasters, could increase our costs and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is also
subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with indirectly sourcing goods from abroad, such as political instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes,
currency fluctuations and local business practices. In addition, requirements imposed by the FDA compel importers to verify that food products and ingredients
produced by a foreign supplier comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA, which could result in certain products being deemed
ineligible for import. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security may at times prevent the importation or customs clearance of certain products and ingredients
for reasons unrelated to food safety.
A U.S. federal government shutdown could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government that began in late 2018 and continued into 2019 adversely impacted many of our family farmers' ability to
access capital, as these farmers receive funding through farm loan programs of the USDA Farm Service Agency. The partial shutdown also impacted our ability to
receive governmental approvals for products and labeling of new products. Another U.S. federal government shutdown of similar or greater duration could similarly
impact our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market efforts to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.
There is scientific consensus that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions have had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weather conditions, and the frequency and severity of natural disasters. If climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be
subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including corn, soybean meal and other feed
ingredients. We may further be subject to unpredictable water availability due to the impact of climate change, and the lack of available water may adversely affect our
business and operations.
Additionally, extreme weather and natural disasters exacerbated by climate change may impact our business. The egg farms in our network are all geographically
located in a region that provides an environment conducive to year-round raising of chickens. However, if climate change negatively impacts the year-round habitability
of this region for chickens, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for our eggs. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including
those caused by climate change, can adversely impact pasture conditions, leading to reduced yields and quality. For example, elevated summer temperatures in the
Pasture Belt have contributed to lower-than-normal shell egg yield at certain of our farms. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may also impact the
habitability and pasture conditions of the farms where we source the cream for our butter products. Further, we may incur increased transportation, storage and
processing costs if we are unable to source products within a certain distance from our processing and co-manufacturing facilities due to the effects of climate change.
Governmental and market concern about climate change and its effects may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects
of greenhouse gases or water usage. Such laws or regulations, to the extent applicable to us or our farmers, suppliers, co-manufacturers or service providers, may result
in significant increases to our costs of operation, particularly the supply chain and distribution costs associated with our products.
Failure to adequately respond to stakeholder scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance issues or failure to achieve our stated impact goals could
adversely impact our reputation and brand.
Our business faces scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including sustainable development, product packaging, renewable
resources, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support
for local communities. In December 2022, we announced a series of impact-related goals relating to, among other things, ecological impacts, diversity and inclusion,
governance accountability and climate change, which we refer to as our Impact Goals. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve these goals. Failure to
achieve our Impact Goals could damage our reputation and brand image, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Furthermore, there exists negative sentiment toward ESG measures among certain individuals and government institutions, and several states have enacted or proposed
"anti-ESG" legislation. While these policies and legislation are generally targeted to investment advisory firms and mutual funds, as we continue to pursue our Impact
Goals and related initiatives, we could face a negative reaction that adversely impacts our business.
Implementation of our environmental and sustainability initiatives, including in connection with our Impact Goals and annual Impact Report, may require certain
financial expenditures and crew member resources, and if we are unable to meet our goals or otherwise fail to meet stakeholder standards or expectations with respect to
ESG issues or our Impact Goals, this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and brand and negatively impact our relationship with our investors, crew
members, farmers, suppliers, customers and consumers.
Risks Related to Legal and Government Regulation
Food safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially and adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits,
product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.
Selling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding
food safety. Illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses, foreign material contamination or other food safety incidents caused by our products, or
involving our farmers or other suppliers, could result in the disruption or discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such farmers or suppliers, or
otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. For example, in December 2019, our co-manufacturer for hard-
boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility, including ours, due to a potential listeria contamination at the production
facility. Our co-manufacturer elected to permanently close the affected production facility and move all production to a different facility, which did not have sufficient
capacity to meet product demand. As a result, we were unable to supply customers with hard-boiled eggs for a period of time in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
33

---


# Page 35 of 100

Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product
liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or
future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our insurance policies would have to be paid
from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources.

The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected raw materials, resulting in
higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by
our actions, could compel us, our farms or suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA or
USDA regulations and policies, and comparable state laws. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost
sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to
attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could be outside the
scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits.

In addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food
company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological
organisms into food products, as well as product substitution. Governmental regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation
strategies specifically to address tampering designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of
product tampering, we could face possible seizure or recall of our products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating results.
Our operations are subject to FDA and USDA federal regulations, as well as other state and local regulations, and there is no assurance that we will be in
compliance with all applicable regulations.

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the USDA and other federal, state and local authorities. With respect to eggs in particular, the
FDA and the USDA split jurisdiction depending on the type of product involved. While the FDA has primary responsibility for the regulation of shell eggs, the USDA
has primary responsibility for the regulation of dried, frozen or liquid eggs and other "egg products," subject to certain exceptions. Specifically, our shell eggs, butter
and hard-boiled egg products are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, including by the Food Safety Modernization Act
of 2011, or FSMA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing,
composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of most food products. The FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range
of requirements, including but not limited to hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, cGMPs and supplier verification requirements. Our shell egg operations
are further subject to FDA regulatory requirements governing the production, storage and transportation of shell eggs for the control of salmonella. FDA-inspected
processing facilities are subject to periodic and "for cause" inspection by federal, state and local authorities. We are subject to requirements under FSMA's foreign
supplier verification program and import tariffs, bond and other requirements imposed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for our butter products, which are
imported from Ireland.

In addition, certain of our products, such as our liquid whole egg products, are subject to regulation by the USDA, including facility registration, inspection,
manufacturing and labeling requirements. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs and other
regulatory requirements for the manufacturing of our products that is conducted by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully
manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, the USDA or others, we or they may be subject to adverse
inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, result in our co-manufacturers' inability to continue
manufacturing for us, result in a recall of our products that have already been distributed and result in damage to our brand and reputation. For example, in December
2019, our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class I recall of all hard-boiled eggs produced at its facility, including ours, due to a potential
listeria contamination at the production facility. We rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If
the FDA, the USDA or another regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our
business may be adversely impacted.
34

# Page 36 of 100

Our liquid whole eggs are subject to the requirements of the Egg Products Inspection Act, or EPIA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the USDA. The
USDA has comprehensive regulations in place that apply to establishments that break, dry and process shell eggs into liquid egg products. This regulatory scheme
governs the manufacturing, processing, pasteurizations, packaging, labeling and safety of egg products. Under the EPIA and USDA regulations, establishments that
manufacture egg products must comply with the USDA's requirements for sanitation, temperature control, pasteurization and labeling. In addition, in September 2020,
the USDA announced that it had finalized its Egg Products Inspection Rule. Pursuant to the regulatory requirements established by this rule, we anticipate that our co-
manufacturers' liquid whole egg establishment will be required to implement Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans within two years after publication of the
final rule in the Federal Register and will further be required to implement Sanitary Standard Operating Procedures within one year after publication in the Federal
Register. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with USDA regulations for the manufacturing of our
liquid whole egg products, which is conducted by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our
specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the USDA or others, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which
could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our co-manufacturers' inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of
our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified
personnel. If the USDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory
requirements, our business may be materially impacted.
Our products that are labeled as "organic" are subject to the requirements of the Organic Foods Production Act, or OFPA, and the USDA's National Organic
Program, or NOP, regulations. The OFPA is a comprehensive regulatory scheme that mandates certain practices and prohibits other practices pertaining to the raising of
animals and handling and processing of food products. We, and our network of family farms and co-manufacturers, contract with NOP-accredited certifying agents to
ensure that our organic products are produced in compliance with the OFPA and NOP regulations. We do not control the farms where our products are raised and rely on
the farms for compliance with the on-farm requirements of the OFPA and NOP regulations. Similarly, we do not control the manufacturing processes of, and we rely
upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with requirements of the OFPA and NOP regulations with respect to organic products handled and manufactured by our co-
manufacturers. If we, the farms or the co-manufacturers cannot successfully raise and manufacture products that meet the strict regulatory requirements of the OFPA
and the NOP, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products as
"organic," could result in the farms or co-manufacturers' inability to continue to raise farm products or manufacture food for us, or we, the farms, or the co-manufacturer
could lose the right to market products as "organic," and subject us, the farms, or co-manufacturers to civil monetary penalties. If the USDA or a comparable foreign
regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially
impacted.

We are also subject to state and local regulations, including product requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions. If our products fail to meet such
individual state standards or are restricted from being imported into a state by regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

We seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality assurance
compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure
compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us, the farms or the co-manufacturers to
comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers' operations could subject us to civil
remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit
the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating
results and business. See the section titled "Government Regulation" in Part I, Item 1, "Business," of this Annual Report for further information on the regulations to
which we are subject.

Changes in existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

The manufacture and marketing of food products is highly regulated. We, our farmers, our suppliers and our co-manufacturers are subject to a variety of laws and
regulations. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, distribution, advertising, sale, quality and
safety of our products, as well as the health and safety of our crew members and the protection of the environment.

In the United States, we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated outside the
United States by various international regulatory bodies. In addition, we are subject to certain standards, such as GFSI standards and review by voluntary organizations,
such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus' National Advertising Division. We could incur costs, including fines, penalties and third-party claims, because of any
violations of, or liabilities under, such requirements, including any competitor or consumer challenges relating to compliance with such requirements. For example, in
connection with the marketing and advertisement of our products, we could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising, including under the auspices
of the FTC and the consumer protection statutes of some states.

The regulatory environment in which we operate could change significantly and adversely in the future. Any change in manufacturing, labeling or packaging
requirements for our products may lead to an increase in costs or interruptions in production, either of which could adversely affect our operations and financial
condition. Changes in marketing or labeling requirements or standards related to our products could require us to revise or discontinue making certain claims or utilizing
certain branding elements, which may make our products less appealing to consumers. New or revised government laws and regulations could result in additional
compliance costs and, in the event of non-compliance, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, withdrawals, recalls or seizures and confiscations, as well as potential
criminal sanctions, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure by our network of family farms, suppliers of raw materials or co-manufacturers to comply with food safety, environmental or other laws and regulations, or
with the specifications and requirements of our products, may disrupt our supply of products and adversely affect our business.

If any partners in our network of family farms, suppliers or co-manufacturers fail to comply with food safety, environmental, health and safety or other laws and
regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, the farms and co-manufacturers
are required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our standards and specifications. In the event of actual or alleged non-compliance, we might be
forced to find alternative farms, suppliers or co-manufacturers and we may be subject to lawsuits and/or regulatory enforcement actions related to such non-compliance
by the farms, suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, our supply of eggs and other raw materials or finished inventory could be disrupted or our costs could
increase, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The failure of any partner farmer or co-manufacturer to produce
products that conform to our standards could adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls, product liability claims, government or
third-party actions and economic loss. For example, in December 2019, our co-manufacturer for hard-boiled eggs conducted a voluntary Class I recall of all hard-boiled
eggs produced at its facility, including ours, due to a potential listeria contamination at the production facility. Additionally, actions we may take to mitigate the impact
of any disruption or potential disruption in our supply of eggs and other raw materials or finished inventory, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential
supply or production interruption, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings and investigations.

Our business operations and ownership and past and present operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and
regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and natural resources. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial
liabilities, fines and penalties or to capital expenditures related to pollution control equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also
experience in the future significant opposition from third parties with respect to our business, including environmental non-governmental organizations, neighborhood
groups and municipalities. Additionally, new matters or sites may be identified in the future, including in connection with the potential expansion of our processing
capacity, that will require additional environmental investigation, assessment, or expenditures, which could cause additional capital expenditures. Future discovery of
contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or future properties, facilities or waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses,
delays to our business and to our proposed construction. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation
of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.

We operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Consequently, we are subject to a heightened risk of
legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance
with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our crew members, consultants, independent contractors, farmers, suppliers, co-manufacturers or
distributors will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise,
of laws and regulations. Legal claims, government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and
operating results. In addition, the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine
and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business.

We are not currently party to any material litigation. However, from time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate
these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these
assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time
and involve a significant amount of management judgment. For example, we have not established a reserve against any potential losses related to a false advertising
lawsuit filed in federal court in May 2021 by alleged consumers of our eggs on behalf of themselves and a putative class, as no class has yet been certified and, at this
point, we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from any assessments and estimates we
may make.

Even when not merited, the defense of claims and litigation proceedings may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in
defending these lawsuits. For example, we have expended both management time and monetary resources in defending the above-referenced lawsuit. The results of
litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in any of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary
damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or
litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the
future.

Furthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is
subject to various exclusions and caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a
variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery.

We are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, industry standards, policies and other obligations related
to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation (including
class claims) and mass arbitration demands, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits and other
adverse consequences.

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit and
share (collectively, process) personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property,
sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions and financial information, which we collectively refer to as "sensitive data."

Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards,
external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements and other obligations relating to data privacy and security.

We may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our
crew members or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third
parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant
consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections and similar actions), litigation
(including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy
or not use personal data. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass
arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for significant statutory
damages depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or
financial condition, including but not limited to loss of customers, inability to process personal data or to operate in

certain jurisdictions, limited ability to develop or commercialize our products, expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry, adverse publicity or
substantial changes to our business model or operations.
Risks Related to Our Status as a Certified B Corporation and Public Benefit Corporation
Our status as a public benefit corporation and a Certified B Corporation may not result in the benefits that we anticipate, and we may be unable to maintain our
Certified B Corporation status.
We have elected to be classified as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. As a public benefit corporation, we are required to balance the financial
interests of our stockholders with the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our conduct, including particularly those affected by the specific benefit
purposes set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. There is no assurance that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit
corporation will be realized and our status as a public benefit corporation and compliance with our related obligations could negatively impact our ability to provide the
highest possible return to our stockholders.
As a public benefit corporation, we are required to publicly disclose a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment
of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties
doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.
While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance,
accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we
have been designated as a "Certified B Corporation," which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance,
accountability and transparency. The standards for Certified B Corporation certification are B Lab and may change over time, and our continued certification is at the
sole discretion of B Lab. To maintain our certification, we are required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with B Lab every three years. We were
most recently recertified as a Certified B Corporation in January 2022. Our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our
choice or by our failure to continue to meet the certification requirements, particularly if that failure or change were to create a perception that we are more focused on
financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corporations, or if our publicly reported Certified B Corporation score
declines.
As a public benefit corporation, our duty to balance a variety of interests may result in actions that do not maximize stockholder value.
As a public benefit corporation, our Board of Directors, has a duty to balance (i) the pecuniary interest of our stockholders, (ii) the best interests of those
materially affected by our conduct and (iii) specific public benefits identified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. While we believe our public
benefit designation and associated obligations will benefit our stockholders, in balancing these interests our Board of Directors may take actions that do not maximize
stockholder value. Any benefits to stockholders resulting from our public benefit purposes may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have
negative effects. For example:
•we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to stakeholders other than our stockholders, including farmers, suppliers,
crew members and local communities, even though the changes may be costly;
⚫we may take actions, such as building state-of-the-art facilities with technology and quality control mechanisms that exceed the requirements of USDA
and the FDA, even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives;
⚫we may be influenced to pursue programs and services to demonstrate our commitment to the communities to which we serve and bringing ethical food
to the table, even though there may be no immediate return to our stockholders; or
⚫in responding to a possible proposal to acquire the company, our Board of Directors may be influenced by the interests of stakeholders other than our
stockholders, including farmers, suppliers, crew members and local communities, whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders.
We may be unable to fully realize the benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our stakeholders, including farmers, suppliers, crew members and local
communities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.

As a public benefit corporation, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our duty to balance stockholder and public benefit interests, the
occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
As a Delaware public benefit corporation, our stockholders (if they, individually or collectively, own at least 2% of our outstanding capital stock or shares
having at least $2 million in market value (whichever is less)) are entitled to file a derivative lawsuit claiming that our directors failed to balance stockholder and public
benefit interests. This potential liability does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore, we may be subject to the possibility of increased derivative litigation,
which would require the attention of management and, as a result, may adversely impact management's ability to effectively execute our strategy. Any such derivative
litigation may be costly and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Being a Public Company
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures.
We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over
financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 also generally requires
an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we
remain an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of the exemption
permitting us not to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.
Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we continue to incur substantial expense and expend significant management efforts to ensure ongoing
compliance. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we
identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is
effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any
failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we
have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm conducts its Section 404 reviews, we could lose investor
confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or
investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital
markets.
We are an "emerging growth company," and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies
will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory
vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an
emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to
comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to
investors. In addition, if we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will no longer be able to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards and as a result will incur additional expenses.
39

# Page 41 of 100

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (1) December 28, 2025; (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross
revenue is $1.235 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt
securities; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of
the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year.

We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. For example, if we do not adopt a new or
revised accounting standard, our future results of operations may not be comparable to the results of operations of certain other companies in our industry that have
adopted such standards. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our
stock price may be more volatile.
Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property
*If our data or information technology systems, or the data or information technology systems of third parties upon which we rely, were compromised, we could
experience adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruption of our business
operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits and other adverse consequences.*

In the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely process sensitive data, and, as a result, we and the third parties upon which we
rely face a variety of evolving threats that could cause security incidents. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities and third parties to
connect with our crew members, farmers, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online
and offline fraud and other similar activities may threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive data and information technology systems, and
those of the third parties upon which we rely. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources,
including traditional computer "hackers," threat actors, "hacktivists," organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation
states and nation-state-supported actors. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we also intend to expand and improve our
information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.

Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in
conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable
to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce,
sell and distribute our services.

We and the third parties upon which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through
deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a
result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks,
supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, attacks enhanced or
facilitated by AI, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats.

In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and could lead to significant interruptions in our operations, ability to provide our
products or services, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a
ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.

Additionally, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our
systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities' systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues
that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology
environment and security program.

In addition, our reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other
threats to our business operations. We rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive data in a variety of
contexts, including, without limitation. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise to operate our business. Our
ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If
our third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if
our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be
unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks

40


---


# Page 42 of 100

have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties' infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners' supply chains have
not been compromised.
While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that these incident response
measures will be effective. We take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems (such as our hardware and/or software,
including that of third parties upon which we rely). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may
experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result
in a security incident.
The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of sensitive information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems
or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of
customers and distributors, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Such risks may be increased by the fact that substantially all of our crew members outside of Egg Central Station are working remotely on a permanent basis.
Technologies and security systems in place at our crew members' homes may be less secure than those used in a physical office, and while we have implemented
controls and safeguards to help protect our systems as our crew members work from home, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective.
Any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental
acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive data or our information technology systems, or those of the
third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services.
We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain data privacy and security
obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information
technology systems and sensitive data.
Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and
investors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.
If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse
consequences, such as: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or
oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity;
reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); competitive
disadvantage; financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may prevent or cause customers to stop using our services, deter
new customers from using our services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.
Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient
to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or
sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.
In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive data about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means
that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position. Further, use of artificial
intelligence platforms by our crew members, whether authorized or unauthorized, may increase the risk that our intellectual property and other proprietary information
will be unintentionally disclosed. If we fail to identify and address cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such
risks.

The implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause disruption to our business, and we may not be able to effectively realize the benefits
of this new system.

We are in the process of transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, in order to support our future growth and more fully optimize our
existing processes. The implementation of a new ERP system may prove to be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and it is possible that the system
will not yield the benefits we anticipate. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies related to the new ERP system could materially impact our operations and adversely
affect our ability to process orders, manage our inventory, fulfill obligations to customers or otherwise operate our business. In addition, implementation of a new ERP
system will require significant resources, including the time and attention of our management and key crew members, in order to fully realize the anticipated benefits.
The loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us.

We utilize intellectual property in our business. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers' favorable perception of our products.
We have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise and copyright
protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our
intellectual property, including our trademarks and copyrights.

We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights. Our confidentiality agreements with our crew
members and certain of our consultants, contract employees, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations
to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Further, some of our formulations have been
developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations.

We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully
defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related
registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging
third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers' perception of our brand
and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant
expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse
outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of
these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Other General Risks
Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.

The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are
beyond our control, including those described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section.

Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may also negatively impact the market price of
our common stock, particularly in light of uncertainties surrounding inflation, geopolitical tensions, disruption in global financial and credit markets, public health
pandemics and related impacts.
Insiders have substantial control over us and are able to influence corporate matters.

Based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023, our directors, and officers hold, in the aggregate, approximately 24.5% of our outstanding
capital stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit stockholders'
ability to influence corporate matters, including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.

Sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price
of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing equity holders have substantial
unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold, and therefore they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares.
We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.
In addition, as of December 31, 2023, there were 4,485,861 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or subject to vesting
of outstanding restricted stock awards. We have registered all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of outstanding
restricted stock awards or other equity incentives we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. The
shares of common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options are exercised, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.
Further, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023, holders of approximately 12.5 million shares of our capital stock and certain shares that may be
issued in the future upon exercise or vesting of outstanding equity awards, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering
the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
We may be subject to significant liability that is not covered by insurance.
Although we believe that the extent of our insurance coverage is consistent with industry practice, any claim under our insurance policies may be subject to
certain exceptions, may not be honored fully, in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not have purchased sufficient insurance to cover all losses incurred. If we were to
incur substantial liabilities or if our business operations were interrupted for a substantial period of time, we could incur costs and suffer losses. Such inventory and
business interruption losses may not be covered by our insurance policies. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would
adversely affect our cash position and results of operations. Additionally, in the future, insurance coverage may not be available to us at commercially acceptable
premiums, or at all.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our
stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and provisions of Delaware law applicable to us as a public
benefit corporation, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
*   authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock that may be senior to our
    common stock with terms, rights and preferences determined by our Board of Directors;
*   require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;
*   specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairperson of our Board of Directors, or our Chief
    Executive Officer;
*   establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for
    election to our Board of Directors;
*   establish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;
*   prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;
*   provide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock; and
*   provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for
stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are
incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, which generally,
subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any "interested" stockholder for a
period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an "interested" stockholder.

Also, as a public benefit corporation, our Board of Directors is required by the DCGL to manage or direct our business and affairs in a manner that balances the
pecuniary interests of our stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the specific public benefits identified in our certificate of
incorporation. Additionally, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, a vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock is
required for matters directly or indirectly amending or removing our public benefit purpose, or to effect a merger or consolidation involving stock consideration with an
entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit to ours. Such provisions could also limit the price that our investors might be willing to pay
in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our common stock
would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition.

*Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, with respect to certain matters, the federal
district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could restrict our
stockholders' ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.*

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for certain actions or proceedings under Delaware law, statutory or common
law, including: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us
arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; any action as to which the DCGL confers
jurisdiction to the court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The provisions
would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which
federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities
Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the
threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal
district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.

These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,
officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. While Delaware courts have determined that
such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us and our
directors, officers or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States of America. In such instance, we would expect our efforts to
defend the validity and enforceability of such provisions may require further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions and
there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
Not applicable.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

Risk Management and Strategy

We have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to
our critical computer networks, third party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and software, and our critical data, including intellectual property,
confidential information that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in nature, and personal and financial data regarding our crew members and farmers, which we
collectively refer to as "Information Systems and Data."

# Page 46 of 100

Our Information Technology department, under the leadership of our Vice President of Information Technology ("VP of IT") and with cross-functional internal
and third-party support, helps identify, assess and manage the Company's cybersecurity threats and risks. The Information Technology department identifies and
assesses risks from cybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and the risk profile of the Company and its industry using various
methods, including regular threat assessments (including through interaction with law enforcement), internal and external audits, threat environment scans and third-
party threat assessments, vulnerability assessments, external intelligence feeds and third-party-conducted tabletop training exercises.
Depending on the environment and system, we implement and maintain various technical, physical and organizational measures, processes, standards and
policies designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information Systems and Data, including, for example, a written incident
response plan and incident response policy, business continuity plans, data encryption for certain data, implementation of certain security standards, network security
and access controls, data segregation, asset tracking/disposal systems, penetration testing and required crew member training programs.
Our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into the Company's overall risk management processes. For example,
our Information Technology department and third-party providers work with our senior leadership team to prioritize our risk management processes and mitigate
cybersecurity threats that are more likely to lead to a material impact to our business. Our senior leadership team evaluates material risks from cybersecurity threats
against our overall business objectives and reports to the audit committee of our Board of Directors ("Audit Committee"), which evaluates our overall enterprise risk.
We use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including
professional services firms, threat intelligence service providers, penetration testing providers, dark web monitoring services, cybersecurity consultants, forensic
investigators, training platforms and managed cybersecurity service providers.
We use third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions throughout our business, such as application providers, hosting services, supply chain
resources (including warehousing and cold storage) and contract manufacturing organizations. We have a vendor management program to manage cybersecurity risks
associated with our use of certain of these providers. The program includes, for example, completion of a cybersecurity questionnaire, internal reviews of vendor
security programs and assessments, security assessment calls with vendor personnel and imposition of information security obligations in our vendor contracts.
Depending on the nature of the services provided, the sensitivity of the Information Systems and Data at issue and the identity of the provider, our vendor management
process may involve different levels of assessment designed to help identify cybersecurity risks associated with a provider and impose contractual obligations related to
cybersecurity on the provider.
For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect the Company and how they may do so, see our risk factors under Part 1. Item
1A. "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled "Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property."

Governance

Our Board of Directors addresses the Company's cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The Audit Committee is responsible
under its committee charter for overseeing the Company's cybersecurity risk management processes, including oversight and mitigation of risks from cybersecurity
threats.

Our cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes are implemented and maintained by certain Company management, including our VP of IT, with
the oversight of our Chief Financial Officer. Our VP of IT is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, helping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into the
Company's overall risk management strategy and communicating key priorities to relevant personnel. Our VP of IT, in consultation with our Chief Financial Officer, is
responsible for approving budgets, helping prepare for cybersecurity incidents, approving cybersecurity processes and reviewing security assessments and other security-
related reports. Our VP of IT has nearly 25 years of relevant experience, including leadership roles in the information technology departments of public and private
companies. Prior to joining the Company, he served as VP of IT for another public company in the consumer packaged goods industry.

Our cybersecurity incident response plan is designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members of management depending on the circumstances,
including our internal disclosure committee and our senior leadership team. Senior leadership team members work with the Company's incident response team to help
the Company mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents of which they are notified. In addition, the Company's incident response plan provides for reporting of
certain cybersecurity incidents to the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee receives regular reports from our Chief Financial Officer concerning the Company's significant cybersecurity threats and risk and the
processes the Company has implemented to address them. The Audit Committee also has access to various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity
threats, risk and mitigation.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed
in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and "Special Note Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

Our mission is to bring ethical food to the table, and we are disrupting the U.S. food system by developing a framework that challenges the norms of the
incumbent food model, allowing us to bring high-quality products from our network of family farms to a national audience. This framework has enabled us to become
the leading U.S. brand of pasture-raised eggs and the second-largest U.S. egg brand by retail dollar sales. Our ethics are exemplified by our focus on animal welfare and
sustainable farming practices. We believe our standards produce happy hens with varied diets, which produce better eggs. There is a seismic shift in consumer demand
for natural, traceable, clean-label, great-tasting and nutritious foods. Supported by a steadfast adherence to the values on which we were founded, we have designed our
brand and products to appeal to this consumer movement.

Our purpose is rooted in a commitment to Conscious Capitalism, which prioritizes the long-term benefits of each of our stakeholders (farmers and suppliers,
customers and consumers, communities and the environment, crew members and stockholders). We make decisions based on what is sustainable for all our stakeholders.
Our collective sustainable business practices will enable us to fulfill our purpose of improving the lives of people, animals, and the planet through food, now and long
into the future. For us, it is not about short-term outcomes or a trade-off between purpose and profit. We are fierce business competitors who believe that prioritizing the
long-term viability of all stakeholders will produce stronger outcomes, for everyone, over time. These principles guide our day-to-day operations and, we believe, help us
deliver a more sustainable and successful business. Our approach has been validated by our financial performance and our January 2022 recertification as a Certified B
Corporation, a designation reserved for businesses that balance profit and purpose to meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, public
transparency and legal accountability.

We source our eggs from a network of over 300 family farms. We have strategically designed our supply chain to ensure high production standards and optimal
year-round operation. We are motivated by the positive impact we have on rural communities and enjoy a strong relationship and reputation with our network of
farmers.

We primarily work with our farms pursuant to buy-sell contracts. Under these arrangements, the farmer is responsible for all of the working capital and
investments required to produce the eggs and manage the farm, including purchasing the birds and feed supply. During the last quarter of fiscal 2023, as a result of
increasing construction costs associated with our new farms, we incurred incremental farm recruitment costs that will be required to be paid in advance of these farms
beginning to produce eggs, and we expect such incremental costs to continue into fiscal 2024. These costs are expected to be recognized over the term of the related buy-
sell contracts with the new farms, which are generally four to five years in length. We believe the unfavorable impact to our working capital resulting from these upfront
costs could range from $10.0 million to $12.0 million during fiscal 2024. The impact to fiscal year 2023 working capital was immaterial, and the impact to our gross
margin is also expected to be immaterial during the term of these agreements. We are contractually obligated to purchase all of the eggs produced by the farmer during
the term of the contract at an agreed-upon price that depends upon pallet weight and is adjusted quarterly for changes in feed cost.

We believe we are a strategic and valuable partner to retailers. We have continued to command premium prices for our products, including our shell eggs. Our
loyal and growing consumer base has fueled the expansion of our brand from the natural channel to the mainstream channel. We believe the success of our brand
demonstrates that consumers are demanding premium products that meet a higher ethical standard of food production. We have a strong presence at The Kroger Co., or
Kroger, Sprouts Farmers Market, or Sprouts, Target Corporation and Whole Foods Market, Inc., or Whole Foods, and we also sell our products at Albertsons
Companies, Inc., Publix Super Markets, Inc. and Walmart, Inc. We offer 23 retail stock keeping units, or SKUs, through a multi-channel retail distribution network. We
believe we have significant room for growth within the retail and foodservice channels through growing brand awareness, gaining additional points of distribution and
new product innovation.

Our shell eggs are collected from farmers by a third-party freight carrier and placed in cold storage until we pack them for shipping to our customers at our state-
of-the-art shell egg processing facility, Egg Central Station. Egg Central Station is approximately 153,000 square feet and utilizes highly automated equipment to grade
and package our shell egg products. Egg Central Station is capable of packing approximately six million eggs per day and has an SQF Excellent rating, the highest level
of such certification from the Global Food Safety Initiative.

Our products are distributed through a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who will in turn sell
our products to consumers. We serve the majority of natural channel customers through food distributors, which purchase, store, sell and deliver our products to our
customers. We serve mainstream retailers by arranging for delivery of our products directly through their distribution centers. We also leverage distributor relationships
to fulfill orders for certain independent grocers and other customers.
We have experienced consistent sales growth. We had net revenue of $471.9 million and $362.1 million, net income of $25.6 million and $1.2 million, and
Adjusted EBITDA of $48.3 million and $16.2 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-
GAAP financial measure. See the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA" below for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.
Known Trends, Events and Uncertainties
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
Since the initial outbreaks of HPAI in early 2022, we have been closely following the progression of the virus and working with our farmers, veterinarians,
government health officials and animal welfare auditors to ensure that our flocks are kept as safe as possible. To date, we have experienced outbreaks at four of our
farms, one located in Missouri, one in Tennessee and two in Kansas. While we have not experienced material disruptions to our egg supply due to HPAI outbreaks, if a
substantial portion of our farms or production facilities were affected, this could materially and negatively affect our supply chain and operating results. Additionally,
HPAI has at times resulted in supply shortages and price increases across the egg market. We are confident in the measures we have taken to reduce the risk of HPAI on
our farms and production facilities, as well as our ability to mitigate impacts on supply. However, given continued uncertainty about future outbreaks and governmental
responses to such outbreaks, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that HPAI will have on our business.
Economic Uncertainties
The current inflationary environment may affect our business and corresponding financial position and cash flows. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the
cost of materials and supplies, interest rates and overhead costs, may adversely affect our operating results. Elevated interest rates also present a recent challenge
impacting the U.S. economy and could make it more difficult for us to obtain traditional financing on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future. Additionally, some
economic observers suggest that we should expect a higher recession risk to continue over the next year, which, together with the foregoing, could result in further
economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets in the near term, and could negatively affect our operations. Furthermore, such economic conditions have at
times produced downward pressure on share prices. We have experienced and may continue to experience increases in our operating costs, including our labor costs and
research and development costs, due to supply chain constraints, consequences associated with global health pandemics, geopolitical tensions, and employee availability
and wage increases, all of which may result in additional stress on our working capital resources. We work closely with our farmers, suppliers and third-party
manufacturers to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our product supplies as a result of supply chain disruptions associated with
such uncertainties. We currently expect to have an adequate supply of our products, packaging, and freight through fiscal year 2024. However, while we are currently
ramping up capacity with our new supplier of butter, recent volatility in the markets for raw materials could affect supply of our butter products in fiscal year 2024.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview
With cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $116.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and $20.0 million available under our credit facility agreement
with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility, we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to make investments in our business to support our long-term
growth strategy. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, together with cash provided by our operating activities
and availability of borrowings under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months and to make investments in our
business in support of our long-term growth strategy.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of new and existing customer growth, our investments in innovation, our
investments in acquisitions or other growth opportunities, our investments in partnerships and unexplored channels and ongoing costs associated with expansions of our
production capacity. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. However, a significant disruption of global financial markets (including a
disruption due to public health pandemics, geopolitical tensions and wars, inflation or other factors) may result in our inability to access additional capital, which could
in the future negatively affect our operations. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at
all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation and product expansion, we
may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and results of operations. For additional information, see the section titled
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.
Our Fiscal Year
We report on a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year, ending on the last Sunday in December. In a 52-week fiscal year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. The
additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Our first 53-week fiscal year as a public company
occurred in fiscal 2023, which began on December 26, 2022 and ended on December 31, 2023. See "Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation" in Note 1 to our
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details related to our fiscal calendar.
Key Factors Affecting Our Business
We believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors. While each of these factors presents significant
opportunities for us, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address to enable us to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of
operations.
Expand Household Penetration
We have positioned our brand to capitalize on growing consumer interest in natural, clean-label, traceable, ethical, great-tasting and nutritious foods. We believe
there is substantial opportunity to grow our consumer base and increase the velocity at which households purchase our products. U.S. household penetration for the shell
egg category is approximately 96.5%, while the household penetration for our shell eggs is approximately 7.5%. We intend to increase household penetration by
continuing to invest significantly in sales and marketing to educate consumers about our brand, our values and the premium quality of our products. We believe these
efforts will educate consumers on the attractive attributes of our products, generate further demand for our products and ultimately expand our consumer base. Our
ability to attract new consumers will depend, among other things, on the perceived value and quality of our products, the offerings of our competitors and the
effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our performance depends significantly on factors that may affect the level and pattern of consumer spending in the U.S. natural
food market in which we operate. Such factors include consumer preference, consumer confidence, consumer income, consumer perception of the safety and quality of
our products and shifts in the perceived value for our products relative to alternatives.
Grow Within the Retail Channel
We believe that our ability to increase the number of customers that sell our products to consumers is an indicator of our market penetration and our future
business opportunities. We define our customers as the entities that sell our products to consumers. With certain of our retail customers, like Whole Foods, we sell our
products through distributors. We are not able to precisely attribute our net revenue to a specific retailer for products sold through such channels. We rely on third-party
data to calculate the portion of retail sales attributable to such retailers, but this data is inherently imprecise because it is based on gross sales generated by our products
sold at retailers, without accounting for price concessions, promotional activities or chargebacks, and because it measures retail sales for only the portion of our retailers
serviced through distributors. Based on this third-party data and internal analysis, Whole Foods accounted for approximately 23% of our retail sales for each of the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.

# Page 53 of 100

As of December 2023, there were approximately 24,000 stores selling our products. We expect the retail channel to be our largest source of net revenue for the
foreseeable future. By capturing greater shelf space, driving higher product velocities and increasing our SKU count, we believe there is meaningful runway for further
growth with existing retail customers. Additionally, we believe there is significant opportunity to gain incremental stores from existing customers as well as by adding
new retail customers. We also believe there is significant further long-term opportunity in additional distribution channels, including the convenience, drugstore, club,
military and international markets. Our ability to execute this strategy will increase our opportunities for incremental sales to consumers, and we also believe this growth
will allow for margin expansion. To accomplish these objectives, we intend to continue leveraging consumer awareness of and demand for our brand, offering targeted
sales incentives to our customers and utilizing customer-specific marketing tactics. Our ability to grow within the retail channel will depend on a number of factors, such
as our customers' satisfaction with the sales, product velocities and profitability of our products.
Expand Footprint Across Foodservice
We believe there is significant demand for our products in the foodservice channel since we offer versatile ingredients with high menu penetrations across
commercial and non-commercial operator segments. We see considerable opportunity to continue to grow the channel in the medium- to long-term with our two-
pronged sales approach to values-aligned foodservice operators and their distributors. We are working with Acxion Foodservice, a foodservice sales and marketing
agency in the consumer packaged goods industry, to increase our category share in broad-line distribution and to get on national and regional restaurant menus.
We are also leveraging foodservice as a critical consumer touchpoint to drive brand awareness, and we are investing in co-marketing to reach new households.
We believe co-branding is mutually beneficial to foodservice operators because it helps to differentiate their brands, enhances their perceived customer value and drives
loyalty.
A multi-unit example from our successful foodservice program is True Food Kitchen, an award-winning restaurant brand and a pioneer of wellness-driven dining
with locations across the United States that shares our values for improving the lives of people, animals, and the planet through ethically produced food.
Expand Our Product Offerings
We intend to continue to strengthen our product offerings by investing in innovation in new and existing categories. We have a history of product introductions
and intend to continue to innovate by introducing new products from time to time. Eggs and egg-related products generated $449.0 million, or approximately 95%, of net
revenue in fiscal 2023. We expect eggs and egg-related products to be our largest source of net revenue for the foreseeable future. We believe that investments in
innovation will contribute to our long-term growth, including by reinforcing our efforts to increase household penetration. Our ability to successfully develop, market
and sell new products will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of capital to invest in innovation, as well as changing consumer preferences and
demand for food products.
Key Components of Results of Operations
Net Revenue
We generate net revenue primarily from sales of our products, including eggs and butter, to our customers, which include natural retailers, mainstream retailers
and foodservice customers. We sell our products to customers on a purchase-order basis. We serve the majority of our natural channel customers and certain independent
grocers and other customers through food distributors, which purchase, store, sell and deliver our products to these customers.
We periodically offer promotional incentives to our customers, including rebates, temporary price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements,
product coupons and other trade activities. At the end of each accounting period, we recognize a liability for an estimated promotional allowance reserve. We
periodically provide credits or discounts to our customers in the event that products do not conform to customer expectations upon delivery or expire at a customer's site.
We treat these credits and discounts as a reduction of the sales price of the related transaction at the time of sale. We anticipate that these promotional activities, credits
and discounts could materially impact our net revenue and that changes in such activities could impact period-over-period results.

Our shell eggs are sold to consumers at a premium price point, and when prices for commodity shell eggs fall relative to the price of our shell eggs (including due
to any price increases we may implement), price-sensitive consumers may choose to purchase commodity shell eggs offered by our competitors instead of our eggs. As a
result, low commodity shell egg prices may adversely affect our net revenue. We increased prices on certain of our products in each of fiscal year 2022, fiscal year 2023
and fiscal year 2024. While we have not seen significant decreases in sales volume due to previous price increases, if we further increase prices to offset higher
commodity prices or other costs, we could experience lower demand for our products, decreased ability to attract new customers and lower sales volumes. Net revenue
may also vary from period to period depending on the purchase orders we receive, the volume and mix of our products sold, and the channels through which our products
are sold.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists of the costs directly attributable to producing our products which include labor, raw material and packaging costs as well as overhead.
The labor cost is comprised of wages and related costs for our processing crew members. The raw material is comprised of those items necessary to process our finished
egg and butter products and the packaging costs are the cost of the packaging materials our finished products are sold in. Overhead costs in cost of goods sold include
utilities, insurance, inbound freight and storage fees related to our warehouse.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of broker and contractor fees for sales and marketing, as well as personnel costs for sales and
marketing, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and sales commissions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses also include advertising and digital media costs, agency fees, travel and entertainment costs, and costs associated with
consumer promotions, product samples, sales aids incurred to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and build our brand awareness, overhead costs for
facilities, including associated depreciation and amortization expenses, and information technology-related expenses.
Shipping and Distribution
Shipping and distribution expenses consist primarily of costs related to third-party freight for our products. Even though shipping and distribution expenses have
decreased in absolute dollars in the short-term, we expect shipping and distribution expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the medium-to-long term as we continue to
scale our business, and there is a risk that such expenses could continue to increase due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions or wars.

Result of Operations
We report on a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year, ending on the last Sunday in December. In a 52-week fiscal year, each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks. The
additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal year 2023 was a 53-week fiscal year as compared
to a 52-week fiscal year for fiscal year 2022.

The increase in gross profit of $52.9 million, or 48%, was driven by higher net revenue generated during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The
increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022 was primarily driven by volume
increases, in addition to pricing increases across the entire shell egg portfolio in January 2023. The price increases offset an increase in input costs across our shell egg
business (inclusive of commodity, packaging and labor impacts).

# Non-GAAP Financial Measures
## Adjusted EBITDA

We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude:
* Depreciation and amortization;
* Stock-based compensation expense;
* Costs related to the discontinuation of our convenient breakfast product line (see Note 12 "Product Exit Costs" to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report);
* Costs related to the dissolution of the Ovabrite, Inc. variable interest entity;
* Benefit or provision for income taxes, as applicable;
* Interest expense;
* Change in fair value of contingent consideration; and
* Interest income.

Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include the following:
* It does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future;
* Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures;
* It does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense, as such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards;
* It does not include the costs related to the discontinuation of our convenient breakfast product line as these costs are infrequent, unusual and we do not anticipate that we will incur similar significant costs for product exits in the foreseeable future;
* It does not reflect the dissolution of the Ovabrite, Inc. variable interest entity due to the infrequent nature of this transaction and we do not expect to experience similar dissolutions in the foreseeable future;
* It does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense;
* It does not consider the impact of any contingent consideration liability valuation adjustments; and
* It does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us.

In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our net income and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.

¹ Amount also includes finance lease amortization.
² Amount reflects the change in fair value of a contingent consideration liability in connection with our 2014 acquisition of certain assets of Heartland
Eggs.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock, proceeds from borrowings and cash flows from the sale of our
products. We had net income of $25.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and retained earnings of $29.7 million as of December 31, 2023.

**Funding Requirements**

We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash provided by our operating activities and available borrowings under our
existing Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months. We further believe that we will be able to fund potential
operating expenses and cash obligations beyond the next 12 months, through a combination of existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash provided
by our operating activities and available borrowings under our Credit Facility.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of new and existing customer growth, our investments in innovation, our
investments in acquisitions, partnerships and unexplored channels and the potential costs associated with future expansion of our production capacity. As of December
31, 2023, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases totaled $9.8 million and future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance
leases totaled $15.6 million. In addition, as a result of increasing construction costs associated with our new farms, we incurred incremental farm recruitment costs that
will be required to be paid in advance of these farms being able to produce eggs, and we expect such incremental costs to continue into fiscal 2024. These costs are
expected to be recognized over the term of the related buy-sell contracts with the new farms, which are generally four to five years in length. Additionally, we are
currently in the process of exploring potential sites and designs for an additional egg packing facility. We anticipate that we will incur approximately $10.0 million in
capital expenditures related to this goal in fiscal 2024 (including capital expenditures initially planned for fiscal 2023) and will incur further expenditures in the years
following. Finally, we anticipate increased expenditures in marketing during fiscal 2024 to support progress toward our long-term marketing goals.

**Credit Facility**

We originally entered into our Credit Facility with PNC Bank, National Association, or PNC Bank, in October 2017. The Credit Facility initially included a $4.7
million term loan, a $10.0 million revolving line of credit and an equipment loan with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.5 million.


---


# Page 60 of 100

Subsequently, terms of the Credit Facility were modified at various times between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. Such amendments (i) amended various
definitions, (ii) waived a technical default in May 2020 which was triggered by exceeding the capital expenditure limit, (iii) increased borrowing capacity and (iv)
extended the maturity date. The Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility in April 2021 eliminated the term loan and equipment loan. The Tenth Amendment to the Credit
Agreement in December 2022 modified certain covenants related to commodity hedging, consented to the dissolution of immaterial subsidiaries and implemented
changes related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective July 26, 2023, extended the maturity date by one year, from
April 2, 2024 to April 2, 2025.
The maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit is currently $20.0 million. Interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit, as well
as loan advances thereunder, accrues at a rate, at our election at the time of borrowing, equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York plus 2.00% or (ii) 1.00% plus the alternate base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets (other than real property and certain other property excluded pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility) and
requires us to maintain three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement. The Credit Facility also
contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, the sale of properties and liens. As a result of the limitations
contained in the Credit Facility, certain of the net assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 are restricted in use. The Credit Facility contains
other customary covenants, representations and events of default.
As of December 31, 2023, there was no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.
See "Long-Term Debt" in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details related to our Credit Facility.

Operating Activities
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022
was due primarily to higher net income in the current fiscal year due to gross margin improvements and improving leverage our of selling, general and administrative
costs. Increases in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the improved cash from operations, partially offset by an increase in our inventory.
Our accrued liabilities were up across nearly all categories with the largest contributor being promotions and customer deductions.
Investing Activities
The increase in cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the continuing maturities of our available
for sale securities and the reinvestment of these amounts into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Financing Activities
The change in cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022 was
primarily due to an increase of principal payments on our finance lease obligations.

Seasonality
Demand for our products fluctuates in response to seasonal factors. Demand tends to increase with the start of the school year and is highest prior to holiday
periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and is lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, comparisons
of our sales and results of operations between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and related notes thereto. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that, in accordance with GAAP, involve a significant level of
estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Management has determined that our
most critical accounting estimates are those relating to revenue recognition and trade promotions, income taxes, and contingencies. Although we believe that the
estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ materially from
those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. For further discussion about our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Revenue Recognition and Trade Promotions
We recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has
transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer based on terms of the sale. Revenue is measured by the transaction price, which is
defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or
expected variable consideration, which include trade promotions as well as chargebacks such as coupons, discounts, rebates, spoils, and other programs. Variable
consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue, at the time of sale, based on the amount we expect to incur.
The transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration. We base these estimates on current forecasted activity and historical
experience. We review our expected promotional rates and volumes each period, as well as our historical experience related to customer deductions for wrong, missing,
damaged or aged product and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized. The impact of any adjustments is recognized in the
period the adjustments are identified.
We do not believe it is reasonably likely that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above,
estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a short duration and historical differences between actual
experience compared to estimated volumes, performance and redemptions have not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, if the level
of redemption rates, volumes or performance were to vary significantly from our estimates, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. We have not
made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years.
Income Taxes
We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes.
We are periodically audited by taxing authorities and consider any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing our income tax expense. Any audit
adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate.
Deferred income taxes relate primarily to depreciation expense and share-based compensation programs accounted for differently for financial and income tax
purposes. Changes in tax laws and rates could materially affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is
more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. Changes in projected future earnings could affect our recorded valuation allowances, if
any, in the future.
We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues for which the benefit is more likely than not based on our analysis of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that
is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been
established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

# Contingencies

We recognize the costs of legal defense for the legal proceedings to which we are a party during the periods in which the costs are incurred. After considerable analysis of the facts and circumstances of each case, we determine the amount of reserves required, if any. We evaluate whether a loss contingency exists, and if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss would be accrued.

There were no loss contingency reserves for the past three fiscal years. In May 2021, the Company and certain of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a class action complaint captioned *Nicholas A. Usler et al. v. Vital Farms, Inc. et al.* in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged false advertising claims on behalf of themselves and a putative class of alleged consumers of the Company's shell egg products. The named officers of the Company were subsequently dismissed as defendants in this matter. In September 2023, the parties engaged in mediation to discuss potential settlement of remaining claims, but no agreement was reached and the lawsuit is ongoing. The Company believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending itself in this matter. Given the uncertainty of the litigation, the stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from the claim. Future reserves may be required if losses are deemed reasonably estimable and probable due to changes in our assumptions, the effectiveness of legal strategies, or other factors beyond our control. Future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations in these legal proceedings.

# Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See the sections titled "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" and "– Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted" in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

# Emerging Growth Company Status

In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an "emerging growth company" may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

# Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates.

# Commodity Price Risk

We source our eggs and cream for our butter products from our network of family farms. The price we pay to purchase shell eggs from farmers fluctuates based on pallet weight, and under our buy-sell contracts, which account for all of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December 31, 2023, the price we pay is also adjusted quarterly for changes in feed cost, which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Our buy-sell contracts subject us to risk of price fluctuations in feed ingredients, primarily consisting of corn and soy. The price we pay for cream is subject to butter commodity fluctuations. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these ingredients across our product lines as of December 31, 2023 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately $8.8 million. We strive to offset the impact of ingredient cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.

Costs of packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict creating price risk. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of packaging raw materials as of December 31, 2023 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately $3.5 million. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw materials cost increases with a combination of negotiated pricing agreements, cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.

# Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility. See the section
titled "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facility" above for additional details related to our Credit Facility. Based on the average interest rate on the
instruments under the Credit Facility during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not believe that a
hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
Our interest-earning instruments also carry a degree of interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $84.1 million and
investments in available for sale securities of $32.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, the effective maturity of our investment securities available for sale was
approximately 4 months and the composite credit rating of the holdings is Aa3 on the Moody's rating scale.
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk
exposure during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Vital Farms, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vital Farms, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022,
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ KPMG LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.





VITAL FARMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Vital Farms, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") was incorporated in Delaware on June 6, 2013 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The Company
packages, markets and distributes shell eggs, butter and other products. These products are principally sold under the name Vital Farms in addition to other trade names,
primarily to retail and foodservice channels in the United States.
Vital Farms of Missouri, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vital Farms. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the
audited consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In
the opinion of management, the included disclosures are adequate, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2023, consolidated results of operations and the consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature and certain reclassifications of previously
reported amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. A reclassification of $1,539 has been made from accounts receivable, net to prepaids and
other current assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2022 to conform to the current year presentation of our accounts receivable from the
Company's network of farms.
Fiscal Year: The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December and contains either 52 or 53 weeks. Therefore, the financial results of certain 53-
week fiscal years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 contains operating results
for 53 weeks, while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021 contain operating results for 52 weeks.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition, determination of useful lives for property and equipment, trade spend
accruals, goodwill, allowance for credit losses, inventory obsolescence, stock option valuations, accrued liabilities, income taxes and contingencies. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Customers and Risk: A substantial amount of our shell egg processing occurs at our Egg Central Station shell egg processing facility. Any
shutdown or period of reduced production at Egg Central Station, which may be caused by regulatory noncompliance or other issues, as well as factors beyond our
control, such as natural disaster, weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, disease outbreaks or pandemics, equipment failure or delay in raw materials delivery,
would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner, meet our contractual obligations and operate our business.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable and derivative instruments. The Company maintains deposits with large financial institutions that the Company believes are of high credit quality. At times
the Company's cash and cash equivalents balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any
losses related to its cash and cash equivalents balances.
The Company's customer concentration for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at
the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United States. As of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, cash
and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with balances denominated in U.S. dollars and investments in money market funds.

Investment Securities: The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities. The Company
considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12
months, as available-for-sale. The Company classifies these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive income until the security is settled or sold, except for
changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are reported on a gross basis in other expense.

The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in interest
income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method with realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and declines in value due to
credit-related factors, reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income when sold and recorded in other income. Income tax effects related to realized gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities are released from accumulated other comprehensive income quarterly with the recognition of the Company's tax provision.
Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.

Variable Interest Entity: The Company consolidates all entities where a controlling financial interest exists. The Company has considered its relationship with
Ovabrite, Inc. to determine whether the Company has a variable interest in that entity, and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the relationship.
GAAP requires variable interest entities ("VIEs") to be consolidated if an entity's interest in the VIE is a controlling financial interest. Under the variable model, a
controlling financial interest is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE's
economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
potentially be significant to the VIE.

Management performs ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company's involvement with a VIE will cause the
consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of a VIE may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied
prospectively in accordance with GAAP.

Segment Information: The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who
is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. All
of the Company's long-lived assets and customers are located in the United States.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined below:
•Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or
liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.

The carrying values of cash, trade receivables, other non-trade receivables within prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses
and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for credit losses. The Company generally does not
have collateral for its receivables, but the Company does periodically evaluate the creditworthiness of its customers.
Allowance for Credit Losses: The allowance for expected credit losses related to trade receivables is estimated based on the trade receivable aging category,
credit risk of specific customers, past collection history, and management's evaluation of accounts receivable. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires
estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The provision for expected credit losses is charged within selling, general
and administrative costs. These losses have been immaterial to date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
The allowance for expected credit losses related to other non-trade receivables are estimated based on the aging category and the probability of default.
Provisions for current estimated credit losses are classified within selling, general and administrative costs.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under the weighted average cost method) or net realizable value. In addition to product cost,
inventory costs include expenditures such as in-bound shipping and handling and warehousing costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and
location. Inventory includes eggs and egg-related products, butter and butter-related products, packaging, feed, laying hens, pullets, and equipment parts. A reduction in
the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to net realizable value is recorded in cost of goods sold with the offset to inventory. Any inventory that does not meet
the quality control standards of the Company is separated and written down to its net realizable value.
Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to reduce its exposure to commodity price
risk. Business operations give rise to certain market exposures, mostly due to changes in commodity prices of corn and soybean meal. Credit risks associated with
derivative contracts are not significant, as the Company minimizes counterparty exposure by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and collateralized insurers and by
utilizing exchange traded instruments and insurance backed commodity settlement contracts. While the Company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit
risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. The Company does not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes. Additionally, the
Company's derivative contracts are short-term in duration and do not make use of credit-risk-related contingent features.
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are
recorded as incurred within other expense, net. Net realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are reported as a reconciling item from net income to cash from
operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to settlements and purchases of derivative instruments are reported as investing
activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The general range of useful lives of other property, plant and equipment is as
follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Estimated Useful Life</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Land</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Land improvements</td>
    <td>15 to 20 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buildings and improvements</td>
    <td>15 to 39 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vehicles</td>
    <td>5 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Machinery and equipment</td>
    <td>2 to 7 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Furniture and fixtures</td>
    <td>5 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>Lesser of lease term or 5 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, with any
resulting gain or loss recorded in operations in the consolidated statements of income. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred to operations.

Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company's goodwill impairment test is performed at the enterprise level given the single reporting unit.
The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances existed that would lead the Company to conclude that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is below the carrying amount based on qualitative factors or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred
that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill assessment would be required. In the quantitative evaluation, the fair value of the reporting unit is
determined and compared to the carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be recoverable and no further
action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
reporting unit's fair value and a charge is reported as impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statements of income. To date, the Company has not recorded any
impairment charges associated with its goodwill.
Leases: The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the
agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. Under ASC 842, Leases ("Topic 842"), a contract is or contains a lease when (i) explicitly or implicitly identified
assets have been deployed in the contract and (ii) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how
and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract. The Company also considers whether its service arrangements include the right to control the use
of an asset.
The Company has made an accounting policy election not to recognize right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or
less. For all other leases, the Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the
commencement date of the lease. The Company's recognized ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, which are reduced by any lease incentives.
Future lease payments may include fixed rent escalation clauses or payments that depend on an index (such as the Consumer Price Index measured by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics). Subsequent index changes and other periodic market-rate adjustments to base rent are recorded as variable lease expense during the period in
which they are incurred. Residual value guarantees or payments for terminating the lease are included in the lease payments only when it is probable they will be
incurred.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to account for lease and non-lease components in its contracts as a single lease component for all asset
classes. The non-lease components typically represent additional services transferred to the Company, such as common area maintenance for real estate, which are
variable in nature and recorded in variable lease expense in the period incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and
eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by
which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends
and prospects and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021.
Noncontrolling Interest: The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to VIEs, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as equity in the
consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity's equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is included in
consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the parent entity's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in
deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any
retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of
the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss. Affiliate equity interests where the Company has certain rights to demand settlement are presented at their current
redemption values, as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Because these transactions take place between entities under common
control, any gains or losses attributable to these transactions are required to be included within additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company
considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded, if necessary, to reduce net deferred tax
assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax
examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial
determination of the sustainability of the position and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed. Additionally, the Company must accrue interest and related penalties,
if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.
The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2023 and
December 25, 2022 the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $171 and $85.
Net Income per Share Attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. Common Stockholders: The Company applies the two-class method to compute basic and diluted
net income per share attributable to the Company's common stockholders when shares meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines
net income per share for each class of the Company's common stock and preferred stock according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in
undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between the Company's common stock
and preferred stock based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income for the period had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no
allocation required under the two-class method since the preferred stock does not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company's losses.
Basic net income per share attributable to the Company's stockholders is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during the period without consideration of potentially dilutive common stock. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue shares of the Company's common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock
that then shared in the earnings of the Company unless inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net
loss per common share attributable to the Company's common stockholders is the same as basic net loss, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to
have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of products to its customers, which include natural channel retailers, mainstream
channel retailers and foodservice customers. The Company sells its products to customers on a purchase-order basis.
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and the related performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs upon
delivery of the product to the customer, for an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering the product. The
Company offers sales incentives through various programs to customers and allow deductions from its customers, which may include credits or discounts to customers
in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer's site. The cost associated with promotions and chargebacks is estimated and
recorded as a reduction in revenue and is recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of
this cost therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed. Differences between estimated cost and actual
redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.
In many cases, key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a regular basis such that most customer arrangements and related
incentives have a duration of less than one year. Amounts billed and due from customers are short-term in nature and are classified as receivables since payments are
unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payments are due.
Treasury Stock: The Company records treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The
Company's accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from the Company's common stock and to reflect any excess of
cost over par value as a reduction to additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares).
Shipping and Distribution: The Company's shipping and distribution costs include costs incurred with third-party carriers to transport products to customers
and salaries and overhead costs related to activities to prepare the Company's products for shipment. Shipping and distribution costs were $27,344, $30,104, and $24,979
during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, respectively. Freight-in costs are included within cost of goods sold and
were $4,823, $9,610, and $7,623 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation: The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value on the date of
the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Stock
options generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest ratably over three
years from the date of grant and contain no other service or performance conditions. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service or vesting period. Forfeitures for stock options and restricted stock awards are recognized as they occur. The fair value of each stock option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including
the fair market value of the Company's common stock, expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that
approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company's expected dividend yield. The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its
consolidated statements of income in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are
classified.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses: Advertising and promotion expenses consist primarily of production costs and the costs to communicate the
advertisements to promote and market the Company's products. Production costs such as idea development, artwork, audio and video crews and other upfront
development costs are expensed the first time the associated advertising campaign is launched or aired. The costs to communicate the advertisements such as airtime and
distribution costs are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, the Company incurred
advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $23,625, $13,301, and $11,469, respectively.

Emerging Growth Company Status: The Company is an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ("JOBS
Act"). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to
private companies.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments
Credit Losses (Topic 326),
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13") and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04,
ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02, ASU 2020-03 and ASU 2022-02 (collectively, "Topic 326"), to introduce a new impairment model for
recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. Topic 326 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost
to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including
historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in
determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on December 26, 2022.
Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. There was no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements at adoption.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ("ASU 2019-12"), which
intends to simplify the guidance by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying or amending existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12
during fiscal year 2022 and there was no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2022 and
December 31, 2023.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07") in order to improve stockholders' understanding of an entity's business activities through enhanced
disclosures around reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 will require incremental and more detailed disclosure regarding segment expenses on both an annual and interim
basis. For public companies ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its
pending adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09") in order to
enhance the transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is applicable to all entities subject to income tax and it will require disclosure of certain
categories within the rate reconciliation to improve consistency as well as disclosure of reconciling items which meet a certain quantitative threshold which will
improve transparency. Additionally, entities must disclose the amount of taxes paid to federal, state and foreign municipalities. For public business entities ASU 2023-
09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning December 30, 2024. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.

As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, there were 47 diversified issuances in the Company's securities portfolio in an unrealized loss position, with
credit ratings from BBB- to AAA. As of December 31, 2023, there are no individual bonds with unrealized losses exceeding $46, and 46 issuances have been in a loss
position greater than 12 months.
The decline in fair value has resulted primarily from rising interest rates over the last 12 months, and the Company does not believe there has been any
significant decline in the creditworthiness of the issuers. The Company also does not believe it is likely that a significant number of bonds will be called early, and it
does not have liquidity needs that would necessitate a sale of any material investments prior to maturity. Therefore, the Company has not recorded an allowance for
credit losses on the investment securities as of December 31, 2023.
The fair value and location of all investment securities are included in "Fair Value Measurements" in Note 5 below.
4. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility. Such instruments may include call options on commodity
price contracts. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Company's commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in other expense,
net. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities.
The following table presents the aggregated outstanding notional amounts related to the Company's derivative financial instruments for the periods presented:

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, the pre-tax amount of commodity contract derivative losses
recognized in other expense, net was $2,435, $0, and $0, respectively.
The fair value and location of all outstanding derivative financial instruments are included in "Fair Value Measurements" in Note 5 below.
5. Fair Value Measurements
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs
specific to the asset or liability.

7. Allowance for Credit Losses
As of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $777 and $699, respectively.
The Company recognizes current estimated credit losses ("CECL") for accounts receivable. The CECL for trade receivables are estimated based on the trade
receivable aging category, credit risk of specific customers, past collection history, and management's evaluation of accounts receivable. The Company also has other
receivables which are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets. The CECL for other receivables are estimated based on the other receivables aging
category and the probability of default. Provisions for CECL are classified within selling, general and administrative costs.
Changes in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented were as follows:

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment
was approximately $7,925, $5,441, and $3,540, respectively.

10. Leases

The Company leases office facilities, warehouses, office equipment and vehicles for delivery of products under lease agreements with initial terms approximating
one to five years. The Company's finance leases include leases on a transportation fleet as well as office equipment and its operating leases primarily consist of leases on
its buildings, including its corporate headquarters.

In addition, substantially all the Company's long-term supply contracts with farms contain components that meet the definition of embedded leases within the
scope of Topic 842. These arrangements convey to the Company the right to control implicitly identified property, plant and equipment as it takes substantially all the
utility generated by these assets over the term of the arrangements at a variable price. The initial term of these supply agreements ranges from one to seven years.
Excluding upfront leasing costs discussed below, the total purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable and represent rentals; there are no
minimum purchase commitments associated with these long-term supply contracts. During December 2023, the Company executed two long-term supply contracts with
farms to provide an upfront lease payment to offset farm construction costs, loans and other startup costs. The upfront leasing costs have been classified within our
operating lease right-of-use assets on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2023 and will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the term of
the long term supply arrangements.

As the classification and timing of recognition of costs attributable to the eggs and embedded cost of the lease rentals are identical, the Company does not allocate
the total purchase cost of eggs between the cost of the eggs and the embedded cost of the lease rentals or distinguish between them in its accounting records. The
Company records the total purchase cost of eggs, which includes costs associated with the eggs and the corresponding cost of embedded lease rentals from the same
arrangement, into inventory. These costs are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggs are sold to customers and are also reported as part of our variable
lease cost.

The Company's office lease for its corporate headquarters facility in Austin, Texas includes an option to renew, generally at the Company's sole discretion, with
renewal terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. In addition, certain leases contain termination options, where the rights to terminate are held by the
Company, the lessor, or both parties. These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease terms when it is reasonably certain that the Company will
exercise that option. As of December 31, 2023, it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the right to extend its office lease and therefore, the Company
has not included the extended term in the calculation of its ROU assets or liabilities. The Company's leases do not contain any material restrictive covenants or residual
value guarantees.

Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and finance lease cost is recognized as amortization expense for ROU assets and
interest expense associated with finance lease liabilities. Amortization expense associated with our finance leases during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and
December 25, 2022 was $2,565 and $439, respectively, and is recorded within costs of goods sold and selling, general and administrative costs in the consolidated
statement of income.

12. Product Exit Costs

During the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022, the Company made the decision to exit its convenient breakfast product category due to a shift in focus to product offerings that are core to the Company's operations.

13. Long-Term Debt

In October 2017, the Company entered into a credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (the "Credit Facility") that initially included a $4.7
million term a loan, a $10.0 million revolving line of credit and an equipment loan with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.5 million.

Subsequently, the terms of the Credit Facility were modified at various times between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. Such amendments (i) amended various
definitions, (ii) waived a technical default in May 2020 which was triggered by exceeding the capital expenditure limit, (iii) increased borrowing capacity and (iv)
extended the maturity date. The Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility in April 2021 eliminated the term loan and equipment loan. The Tenth Amendment to the Credit
Facility in December 2022 modified certain covenants related to commodity hedging, consented to the dissolution of immaterial subsidiaries and implemented changes
related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective July 26, 2023 extended the maturity date by one year, from April 2,
2024 to April 2, 2025.

The maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit is currently $20.0 million. Interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit, as well
as loan advances thereunder, accrues at a rate, at the Company's election at the time of borrowing, equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as administered by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 2.00% or (ii) 1.00% plus the alternate base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility. During the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023, the Company borrowed and repaid $7.5 million under the revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding amounts under the
revolving line of credit.

The Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company's assets (other than real property and certain other property excluded pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Facility) and requires the Company to maintain three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement.
The Credit Facility also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and the sale of properties and liens. As a
result of the limitations contained in the Credit Facility, certain of the net assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 are restricted in
use. The Company's wholly owned subsidiaries are non-operating and have no restricted net assets within the meaning of Rule 4-08(e)(3) or Rule 12-04 of Regulation
S-X. The Credit Facility also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of default. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants under the Credit Facility.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, which uses the expected option term, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected option term assumption reflects the period for which the Company believes the option will remain outstanding. The Company elected to use the simplified method to determine the expected option term, for all periods presented, which is the average of the option's vesting and contractual term. The Company's computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of selected comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of the option. The risk-free interest rate reflects the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a similar instrument with the same expected term in effect at the time of the grant.

The following table summarizes the valuation model assumptions, fair values and intrinsic values of stock options during the fiscal years indicated:

<table>

A valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A full review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be
considered, including the Company's current and past performance, the market environments in which the Company operates, the utilization of past tax credits, the
length of carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that might be implemented. Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.

The activity in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 was as follows:

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, which represent the aggregate tax effect of the differences between tax return positions
and the benefits recognized in the Company's financial statements. At December 31, 2023, all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
Company's annual effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and the Company does not anticipate the balance of the unrecognized tax
benefits to change materially in the next 12 months.

20. Commitments and Contingencies

Supplier Contracts: The Company purchases its egg inventories under long-term supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. Accordingly, there are no estimable future purchase commitments associated with these supplier contracts and there are no minimum payments associated with these long-term supply contracts. The Company records the total cost of eggs into inventory and they are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggs are sold to customers and are also reported as part of the Company's variable lease cost. During December 2023, the Company executed two long-term supply contracts with farms to provide a one-time payment of $200,000 each at lease inception as an incremental cost of obtaining the lease.

Indemnification Agreements: In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its Board of Directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements.

Litigation: The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies that are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to its business,
including those related to regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee-related matters and taxes, among others. When the Company becomes aware of a claim
or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These
assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual
outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates.

On May 20, 2021, the Company and certain of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a class action complaint captioned Nicholas A. Usler
et al. v. Vital Farms, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged false advertising claims on behalf of
themselves and a putative class of alleged consumers of the Company's eggs. The named officers of the Company were subsequently dismissed as defendants in this
matter. In September 2023, the parties engaged in mediation to discuss potential settlement of remaining claims, but no agreement was reached and the lawsuit is
ongoing. The Company believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending itself in this matter. Given the uncertainty of the litigation, the stage of the
case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the
possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from the claim.

Although the Company maintains insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is
subject to various exclusions and caps on amounts recoverable. Even if the Company believes a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute its entitlement to
recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of the Company's recovery. If it is probable that a loss will
result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be
reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible.

21. Related Party Transactions

Ovabrite: Ovabrite, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Ovabrite"), has been deemed a related party because its founders were stockholders of the Company, with the
majority stockholder in Ovabrite also serving as the Company's executive chairperson and member of the Board of Directors. Since Ovabrite's incorporation in
November 2016, the Company has been deemed to have had a variable interest in Ovabrite, and Ovabrite has been deemed to have been a VIE, of which the Company
has been the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the results of Ovabrite since November 2016. All significant intercompany transactions
between the Company and Ovabrite have been eliminated in consolidation.

Effective August 30, 2022, Ovabrite's Board of Directors and the holders of the majority of its outstanding capital stock consented to dissolving the entity, and a
Certificate of Dissolution was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. As of December 31, 2023, Ovabrite had completed its business activities and liquidated its
remaining assets. The results of operations of the Ovabrite entity were immaterial for all periods presented.

Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc.: The Company utilizes Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc. and Sandpebble South, Inc. (collectively
"Sandpebble") for project management and related services associated with the construction and expansion of our egg processing facilities, including site selection,
project management and related services for the Company's potential future egg packing facility. The Company's contract with Sandpebble for services related to the
Company's next egg packing facility was awarded after a competitive bidding process. Victor Canseco, the owner and principal of Sandpebble, is the father of Russell
Diez-Canseco, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors. In connection with the services described above, the
Company paid Sandpebble $631, $962, and $1,037 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, respectively.
Amounts paid to Sandpebble are included in property, plant and equipment, net and selling, general and administrative costs. As of the fiscal years ended December 31,
2023 and December 25, 2022, amounts owed to Sandpebble were $0 and $51, respectively, and are included in accounts payable.

Whole Foods Market, Inc: A member of the Board of Directors was, until February 2022, an executive vice president and senior advisor at Whole Foods. The
Company serves the majority of its natural channel retail customers through food distributors, such as US Foods Inc. and United Natural Foods, Inc., who purchase,
store, sell and deliver products to Whole Foods. While the Company cannot precisely determine its specific revenue attributable to Whole Foods, it is a significant
customer.

22. 401(k) Savings Plan

The Company established a defined contribution savings plan in 2017 under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This plan covers
substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis.
Company contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and
December 26, 2021, the Company made contributions totaling $1,185, $861, and $651 respectively, to the plan.
