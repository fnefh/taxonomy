<p>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</p>
<h2>Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>A. Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2023 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted.</p>
<p>These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K . Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.</p>
<p>Pfizer's fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three and nine months ended August 25, 2024 and August 27, 2023, and for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>We manage our commercial operations throughthree operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A .</p>
<p>We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for:</p>
<ul>
<li>· in the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty income (substantially all of which is related to Biopharma) from Other (income)/deductions--net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations, and reclassified the associated royalty receivables from Other current assets to Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts in our consolidated balance sheet;</li>
<li>· in the fourth quarter of 2023, we began presenting Product revenues and Alliance revenues as separate line items within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations; and</li>
<li>· segment reporting and geographic information in connection with the commercial reorganization that went into effect on January 1, 2024 (see Note 13 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Business development activities, including the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, impacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2 below, as well as Notes 1A and 2 in our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>B. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2024</h2>
<p>On January 1, 2024, we adopted a new accounting standard which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring equity securities at fair value. The new guidance is consistent with our existing policy; therefore, it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>C. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable</h2>
<p>Customers-Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid in 2023, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. We principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies in 2023. Our vaccines in the U.S. are primarily sold directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Our vaccines outside the U.S. are primarily sold to government and non-government institutions. Certain products in our portfolio are subject to seasonality of demand and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates.</p>
<p>Deductions from Revenues-Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:</p>

<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>Trade Accounts Receivable-Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.</p>
<p>In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.</p>
<p>During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see Note 1G in our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Note 2. Acquisition and Equity-Method Investment</h2>
<h2>A. Acquisition</h2>
<p>Seagen-On December 14, 2023 (the acquisition date), we acquired Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $44.2 billion ($43.4 billion, net of cash acquired). The combination of certain Pfizer and Seagen entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the provisional amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including adjustments made in the first nine months of 2024 (measurement period adjustments) with a corresponding change to goodwill. The estimated values are not yet finalized (see below) and are subject to change, which could be significant. We will finalize the amounts recognized as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.</p>

<p>The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results do not purport to reflect what the combined company's results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor do they project the future results of operations of the combined company or reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated with the acquisition. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected here due to many factors.</p>
<p>The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes various assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Seagen. The historical U.S. GAAP financial information of Pfizer and Seagen was adjusted, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Additional amortization expense of approximately $142 million and $427 million, respectively, related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired.</li>
<li>· Additional expense related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold of approximately $224 million and $673 million, respectively.</li>
<li>· Additional estimated interest expense of approximately $114 million and $905 million, respectively, related to the debt issued by Pfizer and the commercial paper borrowings to partially finance the acquisition.</li>
<li>· Elimination of interest income of approximately $474 million and $804 million, respectively, related to the debt issuance proceeds that were invested prior to the acquisition date and associated with money market funds under the assumption that a portion of these funds would have been liquidated to partially fund the acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above adjustments were then adjusted for the applicable tax impact using an estimated weighted-average statutory tax rate applied to the applicable pro forma adjustments.</p>
<h2>B. Equity-Method Investment</h2>
<p>Haleon-We owned 32% of Haleon as of December 31, 2023. In March 2024, we sold approximately30% of our investment in Haleon through the sale of791 million ordinary shares in a global public offering, and the sale of 102 million ordinary shares directly to Haleon, for total consideration of $3.5 billion. We recognized a gain on the sale of our Haleon shares of $150 million during the first quarter of 2024 in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4 ). After the share sale, we owned approximately 23% of the outstanding voting shares of Haleon as of September 29, 2024.</p>
<p>The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of September 29, 2024, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $11.0 billion. Haleon is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. We record our share of earnings from Haleon on a quarterly basis on a onequarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net .</p>

<h2>Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<h2>A. Realigning our Cost Base Program</h2>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. We expect costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue primarily through 2024 and to total approximately $2.3 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance and implementation costs, of which $1.7 billion is associated with our Biopharma segment. From the start of this program through September 29, 2024, we incurred costs under this program of $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion is associated with our Biopharma segment (including $1.3 billion of restructuring charges).</p>
<h2>B. Manufacturing Optimization Program</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold, which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements. The first phase of this program is focused on operational efficiencies and we expect costs for this first phase to total approximately $1.7 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance and implementation costs, all of which is associated with our Biopharma segment. These costs will be recorded primarily in 2024, with cash outlays expected primarily in 2025 and 2026. From the start of this program through September 29, 2024, we incurred costs under this program of $1.3 billion, substantially all of which is restructuring costs for our Biopharma segment.</p>

<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<p>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)</p>
<h2>Note 5. Tax Matters</h2>
<h2>A. Taxes on Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations</h2>
<p>Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was5.0% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to28.8% for the third quarter of 2023, and was 4.9% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to (6.2)% for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily a result of the jurisdictional mix of earnings and, to a lesser extent, tax benefits related to the closing of IRS audits covering multiple tax years. The positive effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the first nine months ended October 1, 2023, was primarily due to the non-recurrence of tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years in the second quarter of 2023 partially offset by tax benefits related to the closing of the IRS audits covering multiple tax years.</p>
<p>We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The sixth annual installment was paid by its April 15, 2024 due date. The seventh annual installment is due April 15, 2025 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of September 29, 2024. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary due to the availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards or carrybacks.</p>
<p>For the year ended December 31, 2023, our cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $ 3.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion was paid in the U.S.</p>
<h2>B. Tax Contingencies</h2>
<p>We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.</p>
<p>The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. During the third quarter of 2024, we effectively settled the audit of Pfizer's federal income tax returns for years 2016-2018. Tax years 2019-2024 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.</p>
<p>See Note 5D in our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities</h2>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk-A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.</p>
<p>The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swedish krona, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Risk-Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.</p>

<h2>F. Credit Risk</h2>
<p>A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 13C below and Note 17C in our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>As of September 29, 2024, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government money market funds, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S.</p>
<p>With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $910 million, for which we have posted collateral of $917 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments . As of September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $104 million, for which we have received collateral of $129 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.</p>

<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<p>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</p>
<h2>Note 12. Contingencies and Certain Commitments</h2>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5B .</p>
<h2>A. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.</li>
<li>· Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.</li>
<li>· Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.</li>
<li>· Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.</p>
<p>We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.</p>
<p>We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p>Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.</p>
<p>The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader's judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.</p>
<h2>A1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation</h2>
<p>We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that</p>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in nonU.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed BMS's appeal and in October 2023, the Supreme Court refused BMS permission to appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner's patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor's vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.</p>
<p>We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or copromotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.</p>
<h2>Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff</h2>
<h2>Xeljanz (tofacitinib)</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.</p>
<p>In October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In November 2022, we filed an additional patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics relating to its challenge of our extended release formulation and method of treatment patents in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets. In October 2024, we settled the actions against Sinotherapeutics on terms not material to us.</p>
<p>In June 2024, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Biocon Limited, Biocon Pharma Limited and Biocon Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Biocon) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering the composition of matter patent that was challenged by Biocon in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg and 22 mg extended-release tablets. In September 2024, we settled the actions against Biocon on terms not material to us.</p>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>In August 2024, we brought a separate patent infringement action against SpecGx LLC (SpecGX) asserting the infringement and validity of our composition of matter patent, covering immediate release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by SpecGX in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg immediate release tablets.</p>
<p>In October 2024, we brought a separate patent infringement action against Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge) asserting the infringement and validity of our composition of patent, covering immediate release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Breckenridge in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 10 mg immediate release tablets.</p>
<h2>Mektovi (binimetinib)</h2>
<p>Beginning in August 2022, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Mektovi. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2031,two method of use patents expiring in 2033, and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. Beginning in September 2022, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of all six patents.</p>
<p>In August 2022, we received notice from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Teva) that it had filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Mektovi. Teva asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2033 and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. In June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the three patents.</p>
<h2>Vyndaqel-Vyndamax (tafamidis/tafamidis meglumine)</h2>
<p>Beginning in June 2023, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of tafamidis capsules (61 mg) or tafamidis meglumine capsules (20 mg), challenging some or all of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for Vyndamax (tafamidis) and Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine). Scripps Research Institute (Scripps) owns the composition of matter patent and the method of treatment patents covering the products, and Pfizer is the exclusive licensee. Pfizer separately owns the crystalline form patent. Beginning in August 2023, we and Scripps brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents in suit. Pfizer is the sole plaintiff in actions that assert only the infringement and validity of the crystalline form patent.</p>
<h2>Oxbryta (voxelotor)</h2>
<p>In January 2024, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., Zydus Lifesciences Limited, and Zydus Worldwide DMCC (collectively, Zydus) and MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. and MSN Laboratories Private Ltd. (collectively, MSN) separately notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of voxelotor tablets, challenging some of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for Oxbryta (voxelotor tablets in 300 mg and 500 mg strengths and/or for oral suspension) on non-infringement grounds. In March 2024, we filed patent infringement actions against both generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the challenged patents. Zydus and MSN have not challenged our composition of matter patents or method of treatment patents for Oxbryta.</p>
<h2>Nurtec (rimegepant)</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Rubicon Research Private Limited, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Changzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Natco Pharma Limited and Natco Pharma, Inc., MSN, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Apitoria Pharma Private Limited and Aurobindo Pharma U.S.A. Inc. (collectively, Aurobindo) and Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp.

<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>second complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company LLC, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in July 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In May 2023, Alnylam filed a separate complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company LLC alleging that Comirnaty infringes four additional U.S. patents issued on various dates in 2023 and seeking unspecified monetary damages.</p>
<p>In August 2022, ModernaTX, Inc. (ModernaTX) and Moderna US, Inc. (Moderna) sued Pfizer, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Comirnaty infringes three U.S. patents. In its complaint, Moderna stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022. In March 2024, the U.S. Patent Office Patent Trial &amp; Appeal Board instituted a review of two of the three patents in suit.</p>
<p>In August 2022, ModernaTX filed a patent infringement action in Germany against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, alleging that Comirnaty infringes two European patents.

<h2>A2. Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation</h2>
<p>We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.</p>
<h2>Asbestos</h2>
<p>Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.</p>
<p>Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.</p>
<p>There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.</p>
<h2>Effexor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs' claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payor plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court. In April 2024, the parties reached agreements to settle the litigation. Those settlements that required court approval have been approved and this matter is now resolved.</p>
<h2>Lipitor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court's orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the</p>

<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court. In April 2024, the parties reached agreements to settle the litigation. Those settlements that required court approval have been approved and this matter is now resolved.</p>
<p>Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.</p>
<h2>Docetaxel</h2>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. Hospira is a wholly-owned subsidiary that we acquired in September 2015. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.</p>
<p>In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>
<h2>Zantac</h2>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson &amp; Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson &amp; Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants' Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs' expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, which has resulted in the dismissal of all complaints in the litigation. Plaintiffs have appealed the Federal MDL Court's rulings.</p>
<p>In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants' sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants' alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts. The large majority of the state court cases have been filed in the Superior Court of Delaware in New Castle County.</p>
<p>Many of these Zantac-related cases have been outstanding for a number of years and could take many more years to resolve. From time to time, Pfizer has explored and will continue to explore opportunistic settlements of these matters. As of July 2024, Pfizer had settled, or entered into definitive agreements or agreements-in-principle to settle, subject to certain conditions, a substantial majority of the cases filed in state courts in which the plaintiff alleges use of a Pfizer product. The remaining unresolved state court cases continue in various state courts.</p>
<h2>Chantix</h2>
<p>Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer's voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.</p>

<h2>A3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters</h2>
<h2>Monsanto-Related Matters</h2>
<p>In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.</p>
<p>In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia's former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation. In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia's indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia's and New Monsanto's assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation. In 2018, Bayer AG acquired Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which is now a subsidiary of Bayer AG. Since the acquisition, New Monsanto has continued to defend and indemnify Pharmacia for these liabilities.</p>
<h2>Environmental Matters</h2>
<p>In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as Wyeth Holdings Corporation and American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have executed or have become a party to a number of administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and/or federal and state natural resource trustees to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and related environmental remediation activities, and to resolve alleged damages to natural resources, at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.</p>
<p>We are also party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.</p>
<h2>Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health</h2>
<p>In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs' claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting certiorari, vacating the Court of Appeals' decision, and remanding the case to the Court of Appeals.</p>
<h2>Allergan Complaint for Indemnity</h2>
<p>In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.</p>
<h2>Breach of Contract - Comirnaty</h2>
<p>In 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH initiated separate formal proceedings against the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Romania and Hungary in Belgium's Court of First Instance of Brussels. Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking an order</p>

<h2>A4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations</h2>
<p>Like other multi-national pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.</p>
<h2>Greenstone Antitrust Litigation</h2>
<p>In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 50 states and territories filed a complaint in the District of Connecticut against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. Greenstone is a former Pfizer subsidiary that sold generic drugs. The matter was transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, concerning different drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General. In April 2024, the two cases naming Greenstone and Pfizer filed by the State Attorneys General were remanded to the District of Connecticut.</p>

<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies</h2>
<p>In February 2019, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We have produced records in response to these and subsequent requests.</p>

We have produced records pursuant to this request.</p>
<h2>B. Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of September 29, 2024, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.</p>
<p>In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.</p>
<p>See Note 7D in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on Pfizer Inc.'s guarantee of the debt issued by Pfizer Investment Enterprises Pte. Ltd.

<p>We manage our commercial operations throughthree operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. PC1 is our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Pfizer Ignite is an offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer's R&amp;D focus areas. Prior to June 2024, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite were managed together by a single manager as part of the former Business Innovation operating segment. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Our commercial divisions market, distribute and sell our products, and global operating functions are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products. Each operating segment is supported by our global corporate enabling functions. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. We regularly review our segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2024, we made changes in our commercial organization to incorporate Seagen and improve focus, speed and execution. Specifically, within our Biopharma reportable segment, we created the Pfizer Oncology Division, the Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division, and the Pfizer International Commercial Division:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Pfizer Oncology Division combines the U.S. Oncology commercial organizations, global Oncology marketing organizations and global and U.S. Oncology medical affairs from both Pfizer and Seagen.</li>
<li>· Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division includes the U.S. Primary Care and U.S. Specialty Care customer groups, the Chief Marketing Office, the Global Chief Medical Affairs Office and Global Access &amp; Value.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Pfizer International Commercial Division includes the ex-U.S. commercial and medical affairs organizations covering Pfizer's entire product portfolio in all international markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2024, Biopharma's earnings include costs related to R&amp;D, medical and safety, manufacturing and supply, and sales and marketing activities that are associated with products in our Biopharma segment. Prior to 2024, costs associated with R&amp;D and medical and safety activities managed by our global ORD and PRD organizations and overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations were presented as part of Other business activities. We have reclassified our prior period segment information to conform to the current period presentation.</p>
<p>Other Business Activities and Reconciling Items-Other business activities include the operating results of PC1 and Pfizer Ignite as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs as well as our share of earnings from Haleon. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Segment Assets-We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $219 billion as of September 29, 2024 and $227 billion as of December 31, 2023.</p>

<h2>C. Other Revenue Information</h2>
<h2>Significant Customers</h2>
<p>In October 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in the U.S. starting in November 2023. In connection with this agreement, we recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the expected return of an estimated 6.5 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory. In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash favorable final adjustment of $771 million to reflect 5.1 million EUA-labeled treatment courses returned through February 29, 2024, which were converted to a volume-based credit that supports continued access to Paxlovid through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by Pfizer. In the third quarter of 2024, in connection with this amended agreement, we also supplied at no cost to the U.S. government or taxpayers a U.S. SNS of 1.0 million treatment courses to enable future pandemic preparedness through 2028, and recorded revenue of $442 million. While we are recognizing revenue as the6.1 million treatment courses are delivered, there is no cash consideration for these treatment courses.</p>
<p>Revenues from the U.S. government comprised 9% of total revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and7% for both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. Revenues from the U.S. government as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended October 1, 2023 were not material.

<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>Remaining Performance Obligations-Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty and Paxlovid to our customers totaled approximately $6 billion and $1 billion, respectively, as of September 29, 2024, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of these amounts, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2024 through 2028, the timing of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter of 2024 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year. Remaining performance obligations associated with contracts for other products and services were not significant as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Deferred Revenues-Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers for supply of Paxlovid and Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled $3.5 billion as of September 29, 2024, with $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, with $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by amounts recognized in Product revenues as we delivered the products to our customers (including $442 million associated with the U.S. SNS for Paxlovid) as well as the aforementioned $771 million favorable final adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2024 for Paxlovid, partially offset by additional advance payments received in the first nine months of 2024 as we entered into amended contracts. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recognized revenue of approximately $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2023. The Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues as of September 29, 2024 will be recognized in Product revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the products to our customers and satisfy our performance obligations under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues from 2025 through 2028. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p>The following MD&amp;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty income (substantially all of which is related to our Biopharma segment) from Other (income)/deductions--net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior-period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation.</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>Our Business and Strategy --Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. Our 2024 key priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Achieve world-class oncology leadership</li>
<li>· Deliver next wave of pipeline innovation</li>
<li>· Maximize performance of our new products</li>
<li>· Expand margins by realigning our cost base</li>
<li>· Allocate capital to enhance shareholder value</li>
</ul>
<p>One way we believe we will be more efficient, effective and able to execute on these five strategic priorities is through technology, including artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of three operating segments: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A .</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program (Realigning Our Cost Base Program) that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold (Manufacturing Optimization Program), which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements. See Note 3 . For a description of anticipated savings related to these programs, see the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&amp;A .</p>
<p>For additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Our Business Development Initiatives --We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 22, 2024, the filing date of our 2023 Form 10-K, see Note 2 in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 2 for significant recent activities.</p>
<h2>Our Third Quarter 2024 and First Nine Months of 2024 Performance</h2>
<p>Total Revenues --Total revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 31%, in the third quarter of 2024 to $17.7 billion from $13.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an operational increase of $4.3 billion, or 32%, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $133 million, or 1%. The operational increase was primarily driven by growth from Paxlovid, revenues from legacy Seagen products acquired in December 2023 and growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz and Ibrance. Excluding contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty, Total revenues increased $1.7 billion, or 14%, operationally.</p>
<p>Total revenues increased $880 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2024 to $45.9 billion from $45.0 billion in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an operational increase of $1.3 billion, or 3%, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $411 million, or 1%. The operational increase was primarily driven by revenues from legacy Seagen</p>
<p>products acquired in December 2023 as well as growth from the Vyndaqel family, Paxlovid and Eliquis, partially offset by declines from Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty, Total revenues increased $4.6 billion, or 13%, operationally.</p>
<p>See the Total Revenues by Geography and Total Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates. See also The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 13C .</p>
<p>Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income (Loss) -- Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss) in the third quarter of 2024 was $4.7 billion, compared to a loss of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to (i) higher revenues, (ii) a decrease in Cost of sales and (iii) net gains on equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by (iv) higher net interest expense and (v) a charge in the third quarter of 2024 to Other (income)/deductions--net related to the discontinuation of our DMD program.</p>
<p>The increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $2.8 billion, to $8.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 from $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, was primarily due to (i) a decrease in Cost of sales, (ii) higher revenues and (iii) net gains on equity securities in the first nine months of 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by (iv) higher net interest expense, (v) increases in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs and Amortization of intangible assets and (vi) charges in 2024 to Other (income)/deductions--net related to the discontinuation of our DMD program .</p>

<p>Our Operating Environment --We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below, as well as in the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook --Our Operating Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights --The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2024 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.</p>
<p>For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section of our 2023 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation involving certain of our products, see Note 12A1 .</p>
<p>Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payor Group Pressures --Governments globally, as well as private third-party payors in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, "international reference pricing" (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Presidential Administration on regulating drug pricing regardless of which party comes to power following the upcoming November 2024 elections. Implementation of the drug pricing provisions of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, will continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program), which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Eliquis was among the first ten medicines subject to the Program. On August 15, 2024, the U.S. government released the new Medicare price for Eliquis, which, effective January 1, 2026, will be $231.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply. The Eliquis Medicare price will be factored into our long-term financial planning, in accordance with our standard financial reporting and forecasting protocols. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, lead to</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or the 340B Drug Pricing Program (the 340B Program), including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B Program, could have a material impact on our business. See the Item 1. Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and -Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Pricing and Reimbursement sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook--Our Operating Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K .</p>
<p>Impact of the July 2023 Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC) --Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables, including anesthesia, analgesia, and micronutrients. Supply of medicines has recovered from the impact of the tornado.</p>
<p>We incurred losses in 2023 and 2024 that were partially offset by insurance recoveries received in 2023. We expect to record additional insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Product Supply --We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. In 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. Regulatory authorities have issued updated guidance on nitrosamine acceptable intake levels. With this guidance, which included an updated intake level for N-nitroso-varenicline, we have started making regulatory submissions to potentially enable Chantix to return to market in the U.S. and in certain international markets.</p>
<p>Except for the impact of the tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first nine months of 2024 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We continue to monitor industry demand for certain components and raw materials and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact to product supply, including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Voluntary Withdrawal of Oxbryta --See the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>The Global Economic Environment --In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook --The Global Economic Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>COVID-19 --In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In 2023, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts. In September 2023, Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S., triggered by the expiration of contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets were generally under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we started transitioning to commercial markets in 2024. Due to the commercial market transition as well as the anticipated seasonality of demand for COVID-19 vaccinations, we expect approximately 60% of our 2024 global revenues for Comirnaty to be recorded in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In 2023, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies. On October 13, 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in November 2023, with minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024 (see Note 13C ) . Internationally, for Paxlovid, most markets have now transitioned to commercial markets, and we are expecting most revenue for Paxlovid to be generated through commercial channels in 2024.</p>

<p>Israel/Hamas Conflict --Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023. For both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the business of our Israeli subsidiary represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets. We are closely monitoring developments in this conflict, including evaluating potential impacts to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East that may impact global operations. At this time, longer term impacts to the Company are uncertain and subject to change.</p>
<p>Russia/Ukraine Conflict --Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For both the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets. While we are monitoring the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, potential additional sanctions, and actions by our customers or suppliers (including financial institutions) are difficult to predict at this time.</p>
<p>For information on risks associated with these conflicts, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Product Revenue Deductions --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these product revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.</p>

<p>Third Quarter of 2024 vs. Third Quarter of 2023 and First Nine Months of2024 vs. First Nine Months of 2023</p>
<h2>Cost of Sales</h2>
<p>Cost of sales decreased $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the non-recurrence of a non-cash charge of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for inventory write-offs and related charges ($4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $0.9 billion for Comirnaty),</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· an unfavorable change in sales mix of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by higher sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty, including a charge for the 50% gross profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses; and</li>
<li>· an impact of $490 million from our Seagen acquisition, inclusive of the amortization of the fair value step-up of inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost of sales decreased $5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the non-recurrence of the aforementioned non-cash charge of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023; and</li>
<li>· a favorable change in sales mix of $845 million, primarily driven by lower sales of Comirnaty,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an impact of $1.4 billion from our Seagen acquisition, inclusive of the amortization of the fair value step-up of inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 reflects the non-recurrence of the aforementioned non-cash charge of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues and related cost of sales anticipated in the fall and winter seasons. See also Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section for information about our COVID-19 products.</p>
<h2>Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative expenses were relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a decrease of $210 million due to lower U.S. healthcare reform fees primarily related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty, largely offset by:</li>
<li>· an increase of $165 million in marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased $260 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an increase of $600 million in marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products, partially offset by:</li>
<li>· a decrease of $310 million for marketing and promotional expenses for Paxlovid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Research and development expenses decreased $113 million in the third quarter and $77 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· lower spending of $430 million in the third quarter and $930 million in the first nine months related to certain ongoing vaccine programs and as a result of our cost realignment program,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a net increase in spending of $310 million in the third quarter and $850 million in the first nine months mainly to develop certain product candidates acquired from Seagen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Amortization of Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Amortization of intangible assets increased $133 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $461 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· increases of $140 million in the third quarter and $400 million in the first nine months from our December 2023 acquisition of Seagen; and</li>
<li>· increases of $120 million in the third quarter and $360 million in the first nine months related to assets reclassified in 2023 from IPR&amp;D to developed technology rights,</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· decreases of $130 million in the third quarter and $350 million in the first nine months related to changes in asset lives and fully amortized assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<p>Realigning our Cost Base Program --This program is expected to deliver net cost savings of at least $4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2024.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Optimization Program --The first phase of this multi-phased program is expected to deliver savings of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2027, some of which is expected to begin being realized in 2025.</p>
<p>Certain qualifying costs for these programs in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income/(Loss). See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income/(Loss) section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>For a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see Note 3A . The program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of patentbased and regulatory exclusivity expiries as well as the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. Improvement of operating margin will continue to be an important focus for the Company.</p>
<p>Seagen acquisition --In connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by 2026. The one-time costs to generate these synergies are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, incurred primarily from 2023 through 2025.</p>
<h2>Other (Income)/Deductions-Net</h2>
<p>The unfavorable period-over-period changes of $62 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by higher net interest expense and a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to the expected sale of one of our facilities resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program, partially offset by net gains on equity securities in 2024 versus net losses on equity securities in 2023. See Note 4 .</p>

<p>Changes in Tax Laws-Many countries outside the U.S. have enacted legislation for global minimum taxation resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting "Pillar 2" project. The EU has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate the OECD provisions into their respective domestic laws, and countries outside the EU are also enacting the provisions into their domestic law. The provisions are generally effective for Pfizer in 2024, though significant details and guidance around the provisions are still pending. Income tax expense could be adversely affected as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, and such impact could be material to our results of operations. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries.</p>
<h2>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<p>A comprehensive update of Pfizer's development pipeline was published as of October 29, 2024 and is available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.</p>

<p>The late stage development flu program has been removed from the table above as it represented the first-generation quadrivalent candidate. Pfizer is developing secondgeneration candidates with the goal of improving immunogenicity and potentially breadth of protection, including new trivalent formulations that match updated recommendations by the World Health Organization and the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. These candidates are currently in Phase 2. Pfizer will continue to evaluate its influenza vaccine program and discuss next steps with health authorities.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Pfizer announced Phase 3 top-line results for Pfizer and BioNTech's combination mRNA vaccine candidate against influenza and COVID-19 in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The trial did not meet one of its primary immunogenicity objectives of non-inferiority against the influenza B strain despite obtaining higher influenza A responses and comparable COVID-19 responses versus the comparator vaccines. The companies are evaluating adjustments to the candidate and are discussing next steps with health authorities.</p>
<p>In September 2024, Pfizer announced that it is voluntarily withdrawing all lots of Oxbryta (voxelotor) for the treatment of sickle cell disease in all markets where it is approved. Pfizer is also discontinuing all active voxelotor clinical trials and expanded access programs worldwide. Pfizer's decision is based on the totality of clinical data that now indicates the overall benefit of Oxbryta no longer outweighs the risk in the approved sickle cell patient population. The data suggest an imbalance in vasoocclusive crises and fatal events, which requires further assessment. Pfizer has notified regulatory authorities about these findings and its decision to voluntarily withdraw Oxbryta from the market and discontinue distribution and clinical studies while further reviewing the available data and investigating the findings.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the EMA initiated a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Oxbryta (voxelotor) to review the product's benefits and risks. In October, the EC suspended the Oxbryta marketing authorization while the EMA's review of data is ongoing. In addition, the FDA has initiated an evaluation of newly identified safety signals. The FDA also has placed the Oxbryta (voxelotor) investigational new drug application on clinical hold following Pfizer's market withdrawal. Pfizer is working with the EMA, FDA, and other regulators globally in relation to this matter.</p>

<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME/(LOSS)</h2>
<p>Adjusted income/(loss) is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income/(loss), certain components of Adjusted income/(loss) and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes), which is derived from Adjusted income/(loss) and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income/(loss), which is derived from Adjusted income/(loss). Since 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR&amp;D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&amp;D pipeline performance, as measured by three metrics, and performance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee's assessment of other factors. (b)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjusted income/(loss) and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS/(LPS) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholdersdiluted , respectively.</p>
<p>We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&amp;D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Income/(Loss) and Adjusted Diluted EPS/(LPS)</h2>
<p>Amortization of Intangible Assets -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes all amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Acquisition-Related Items -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.</p>
<p>Discontinued Operations -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income/(loss) measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.</p>
<p>Certain Significant Items -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosimilar entry or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information-Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items and the NonGAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue over time, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We expect operating cash flows to be below typical levels this year largely due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses. Additionally, with an anticipated heavy weighting of revenue to the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the expected seasonality of certain products in our portfolio, a potentially higher level of cash collections may carry over into the first quarter of 2025. We continue to believe that with our ongoing operating cash flows, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows , Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity , and the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows section within MD&amp;A. For information on our money market funds, available-for sale-debt securities and long-term debt, see Note 7 .</p>
<p>For information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions and market risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A of our 2023 Form 10-K. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12B .</p>
<p>Credit Ratings --The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&amp;P and Moody's.</p>

<p>Debt Capacity--Lines of Credit --As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had access to a total of $15 billion in committed U.S. revolving credit facilities, consisting of an $8.0 billion facility maturing in October 2025 and a $7.0 billion facility maturing in October 2029, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our global commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facilities, our lenders have provided us an additional</p>
<p>$281 million in lines of credit, of which $246 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>Capital Allocation Framework --Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars: maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in the business and making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. In October 2024, our BOD declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, our remaining share-purchase authorization was $3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first nine months of 2024. See Note 12 in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on our publicly announced share-purchase plans.</p>
<p>In March 2024, we sold a portion of our investment in Haleon for $3.5 billion reducing our ownership interest from 32% to approximately 23% (see Note 2B ). In the fourth quarter of 2024, we sold an additional portion of our investment in Haleon for $3.5 billion further reducing our ownership interest to approximately 15%. Pfizer intends to use the proceeds to support its capital allocation priorities. With the reduction of our Haleon ownership percentage, we will no longer apply the equity method to our investment in Haleon. We expect to begin accounting for our remaining investment in Haleon as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, which is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions--net . We intend to continue to monetize our remaining 15% stake in Haleon in a disciplined fashion, with an objective of maximizing value for Pfizer shareholders.</p>

<li>· our ability to successfully address comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMA, or obtain approval for new products and indications from regulators on a timely basis or at all;</li>
<li>· regulatory decisions impacting labeling, including the scope of indicated patient populations, product dosage, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters, including decisions relating to emerging developments regarding potential product impurities; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain, and the scope of, recommendations by technical or advisory committees, and the timing of, and ability to obtain, pricing approvals and product launches, all of which could impact the availability or commercial potential of our products and product candidates;</li>
<li>· claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates, including claims and concerns that may arise from the conduct or outcome of post-approval clinical trials, pharmacovigilance or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which could impact marketing approval, product labeling, and/or availability or commercial potential;</li>
<li>· the success and impact of external business development activities, such as the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, including the ability to identify and execute on potential business development opportunities; the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all; the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any such transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all; the potential need for and impact of additional equity or debt financing to pursue these opportunities, which has in the past and could in the future result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings and could limit our ability to obtain future financing; challenges integrating the businesses and operations; disruption to business and operations relationships; risks related to growing revenues for certain acquired or partnered products; significant transaction costs; and unknown liabilities;</li>
<li>· competition, including from new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat or prevent diseases and conditions similar to those treated or intended to be prevented by our in-line products and product candidates;</li>

<li>· the exposure of our operations globally to possible capital and exchange controls, economic conditions, expropriation, sanctions and/or other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes;</li>
<li>· the impact of disruptions related to climate change and natural disasters, including uncertainties related to the impact of the tornado at our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC in 2023;</li>
<li>· any changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or threatened terrorist activity, geopolitical instability, political or civil unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and the resulting economic or other consequences;</li>
