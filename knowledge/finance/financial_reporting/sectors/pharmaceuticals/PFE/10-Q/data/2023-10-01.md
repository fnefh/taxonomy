<p>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</p>
<h2>Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>A. Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted.</p>
<p>These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2022 Form 10-K . Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.</p>
<p>Pfizer's fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three and nine months ended August 27, 2023 and August 28, 2022, and for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.</p>
<p>We manage our commercial operations throughtwo operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A below and Note 17A in our 2022 Form 10-K .</p>
<p>Business development activities impacted financial results in the periods presented. In March 2023, we and Seagen announced that the companies entered into an agreement under which we will acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. We expect to finance the transaction substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023 (see Note 7D ), and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The transaction was approved by Seagen's shareholders in May 2023. In October 2023, we received unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC on the proposed acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. See Note 2 below, as well as Notes 1A and 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for segment reporting.</p>
<h2>B. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023</h2>
<p>On January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial statements. See Note 8C .</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023. We applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>C. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable</h2>
<p>Customers-Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. We principally sell Paxlovid to government agencies and distributors. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions.</p>

<p>Trade Accounts Receivable-Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.</p>
<p>In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.</p>
<p>During the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see Note 1G in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investment and Research and Development Arrangement</h2>
<h2>A. Acquisitions</h2>
<p>GBT-On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of cash acquired). In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $3.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $1.4 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life ofsix years, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $672 million of inventories to be sold over approximately three years, (iv) $523 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>Biohaven-On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the fair value of Pfizer's previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300 million. In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of11 years and $450 million of IPR&amp;D, (ii) $828 million of Goodwill , (iii) $813 million of inventories to be sold over approximately two years, (iv) $398 million of trade accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $550 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (vii) $526 million of Other current liabilities . The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>Arena-On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company with development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology and cardiology. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of cash acquired). The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in the first quarter of 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $460 million of indefinite-lived licensing agreements and other, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill and (iii) $490 million of net deferred tax liabilities.</p>
<h2>B. Divestitures</h2>
<p>Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio-On September 19, 2023, we completed an agreement with Alexion, under which Alexion purchased and licensed the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, consisting of an upfront payment of $300 million paid at closing and future contingent milestone payments, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. In connection with the closing of the transaction, Pfizer recognized a $222 million pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4 ).</p>
<p>Discontinued operations--net of tax in the periods presented relate to post-close adjustments for previously divested businesses that were classified as discontinued operations. In the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, amounts recorded under interim agreements, including TSAs and MSAs, associated with these disposals were not material. Under agreements related to the 2020 spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, net amounts due to Viatris were $31 million as of October 1, 2023 and $94 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flows associated with the agreements are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities . For information about the nature of these agreements, see Note 2B in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>C. Equity-Method Investment</h2>
<p>Haleon / Consumer Healthcare JV-On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical consumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.</p>
<p>The carrying value of ourinvestment in Haleon was $10.8 billion as of both October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and is reported in Equity-method investments . The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of October 1, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.3 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The value of our investment was effectively unchanged during the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to our share of Haleon's earnings of $341 million, partially offset by $183 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6 ) and $154 million in dividends. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net . Our total share of Haleon's earnings generated in the second quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the third quarter of 2023, was $122 million. Our total share of Haleon's earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first six months of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first nine months of 2023, was $341 million. Our total share of the JV's earnings generated in the second quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the third quarter of 2022, was $67 million. Our total share of the JV's earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first six months of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the first nine months of 2022, was $402 million. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, our equity-method income included in Other (income)/deductions--net also included charges of $118 million and $119 million, respectively, primarily for adjustments to our equity-method basis differences related to the separation of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV from GSK. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV was not material to our results of operations in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. See Note 4 .</p>
<p>Summarized financial information for our equity-method investee, Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV, for the three and nine months ending June 30, 2023, the most recent period available, and for the three and nine months ending June 30, 2022, is as follows:</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>D. Research and Development Arrangement</h2>
<p>Research and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone-In April 2023, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will receive up to a total of $550 million in 2023 through 2026 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and development expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was $43 million and $88 million, respectively. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.</p>
<h2>Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<h2>A. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program</h2>
<p>In 2019, we announced that we would be incurring costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company Program, a multi-year effort to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our operating structure following Pfizer's transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based global biopharmaceutical business. This program includes activities to (i) restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our operating structure; (ii) transform our commercial go-to-market model; and (iii) optimize our manufacturing network and R&amp;D operations.</p>
<p>The activities associated with transforming our commercial go-to-market model are substantially complete. Activities associated with restructuring our corporate enabling functions and optimizing our manufacturing network and R&amp;D operations are ongoing and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023. The costs to restructure our corporate enabling functions, and to optimize our R&amp;D operations and reduce cycle times, as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio, primarily include severance and implementation costs. The costs to optimize our manufacturing network largely include severance, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, and accelerated depreciation.</p>
<p>From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through October 1, 2023, we incurred costs of $3.9 billion, of which $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion of restructuring charges) is associated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 90% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to be substantially incurred through 2023.</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.</p>
<h2>Note 5. Tax Matters</h2>
<h2>A. Taxes on Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations</h2>
<p>Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was28.8% for the third quarter of 2023, compared to4.0% for the third quarter of 2022, and was (6.2)% for the first nine months of 2023, compared to 10.5% for the first nine months of 2022. The positive effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss primarily resulting from changes in forecast and jurisdictional mix of earnings. The tax benefit for the third quarter of 2023 and the negative effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023, compared to the tax provisions for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, were primarily due to changes in forecast and jurisdictional mix of earnings. The tax provisions for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 also included tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years that included the closing of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits covering five tax years .</p>
<p>We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date. The sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of October 1, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.</p>
<h2>B. Tax Contingencies</h2>
<p>We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.</p>
<p>The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years 2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.</p>

<h2>E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities</h2>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk-A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.</p>
<p>The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Chinese renminbi, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Risk-Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.</p>
<p>The following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts:</p>

<h2>F. Credit Risk</h2>
<p>A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 13C below and Note 17C in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>As of October 1, 2023, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consisted primarily of money market funds mainly invested in U.S. Treasury and government debt, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Germany, Canada, France, the U.K., and Japan.</p>
<p>With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of October 1, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $941 million, for which we have posted collateral of $1.0 billion with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments . As of October 1, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $333 million, for which we have received collateral of $256 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.</p>

<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>corresponding inventory write-offs were based on our analysis of Paxlovid and Comirnaty inventory levels as of October 1, 2023 in relation to our commercial outlook for both products. Based on our current estimates and assumptions, there are no recoverability issues for the remaining amounts.</p>
<h2>B. Other Current Liabilities</h2>
<p>Other current liabilities includes, among other things, amounts payable to BioNTech for the gross profit split for Comirnaty, which totaled $ 533 million as of October 1, 2023 and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>C. Supplier Finance Program Obligation</h2>
<p>We maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating financial institutions. Under these agreements, participating suppliers may voluntarily elect to sell their accounts receivable with Pfizer to these financial institutions. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate and we pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the original maturity dates, which is generally within 90 to 120 days of the invoice date. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Pfizer to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within trade payables in our consolidated balance sheet. As of October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, $781 million and $849 million of our trade payables to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements were outstanding.</p>

<h2>Note 12. Contingencies and Certain Commitments</h2>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5B .</p>
<h2>A. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.</li>
<li>· Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.</li>
<li>· Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.</li>
<li>· Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.</p>
<p>We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.</p>
<p>We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.</p>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.</p>
<p>The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader's judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.</p>
<h2>A1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation</h2>
<p>We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed BMS's appeal and in October 2023, the Supreme Court refused BMS's permission to appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner's patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor's vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.</p>
<p>We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or copromotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.</p>

Teva asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2033 and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. In June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the three patents.</p>

<h2>A2. Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation</h2>
<p>We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.</p>
<h2>Asbestos</h2>
<p>Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.</p>
<p>Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.</p>
<p>There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.</p>
<h2>Effexor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs' claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<h2>Lipitor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of</p>

<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court's orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<p>Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.</p>
<h2>EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)</h2>
<p>In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizer's motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In October 2023, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation on terms not material to Pfizer. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<h2>Docetaxel</h2>
<h2>· Personal Injury Actions</h2>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.</p>
<p>In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Mississippi Attorney General Government Action</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product andeight other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.</p>
<h2>Zantac</h2>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson &amp; Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson &amp; Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants' Daubert</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>motions to exclude plaintiffs' expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, which has resulted in the dismissal of all complaints in the litigation. Plaintiffs have appealed the Federal MDL Court's rulings.</p>
<p>In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants' sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants' alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts. The large majority of the state court cases have been filed in the Superior Court of Delaware in New Castle County.</p>
<h2>Chantix</h2>
<p>Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer's voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.</p>
<h2>A3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters</h2>
<h2>Monsanto-Related Matters</h2>
<p>In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.</p>
<p>In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia's former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.</p>
<p>In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia's indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia's and New Monsanto's assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.</p>
<h2>Environmental Matters</h2>
<p>In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as Wyeth Holdings Corporation and American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have executed or have become a party to a number of administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and/or federal and state natural resource trustees to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and related environmental remediation activities, and to resolve alleged damages to natural resources, at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.</p>
<p>We are also party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.</p>

<h2>Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health</h2>
<p>In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs' claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals' decision. In February 2023, the Court of Appeals denied defendants' en banc petitions.</p>
<h2>Allergan Complaint for Indemnity</h2>
<p>In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.</p>
<h2>Viatris Securities Litigation</h2>
<p>In October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatris common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each company's current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. An amended complaint was filed in January 2023, and alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the Transactions, as well as related communications. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.</p>
<h2>Breach of Contract - Comirnaty</h2>
<p>In September 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH initiated formal proceedings against the Republic of Poland in Belgium's Court of First Instance of Brussels. Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking an order from the Court holding the Republic of Poland to its commitments for COVID-19 vaccine orders, which were placed by the Republic of Poland as part of their contract signed in May 2021.</p>
<h2>A4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations</h2>
<p>We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.</p>
<h2>Greenstone Investigations</h2>
<ul>
<li>· U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Since July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>· State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation</li>
</ul>
<p>In April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated with a MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.</p>
<h2>Subpoena &amp; Civil Investigative Demand relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR</h2>
<p>In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We responded to that subpoena in full and have had no communication with the SDNY in connection with the subpoena since June 2019. Additionally, in September 2020, we received a Civil I nvestigative Demand (CID) from the Texas Attorney General's office seeking records of a similar nature to those requested by the SDNY.We a re producing records in response to this request.</p>
<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies</h2>
<p>In February 2019, we received a CID from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We have produced records in response to these and subsequent requests.</p>
<h2>U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations</h2>
<p>In June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Russia. In September 2019, we received a similar request from the SEC's FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.</p>
<h2>Docetaxel --Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation</h2>
<p>See Legal Proceedings --Product Litigation --Docetaxel --Mississippi Attorney General Government Action above for information regarding a government investigation related to Docetaxel marketing practices.</p>
<h2>U.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations</h2>
<p>In March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our manufacturing operations in India, including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation concerning operations at our facilities in India. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.</p>
<h2>U.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to China Operations</h2>
<p>In June 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in China. In August 2020, we received a similar request from the SEC's FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.</p>
<h2>Zantac--State of New Mexico and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore Civil Actions</h2>
<p>See Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation--Zantac above for information regarding civil actions separately filed by the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants' alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Biohaven</h2>
<p>In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice's Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York issued a CID relating to Biohaven. The CID seeks records and information related to, among other things, engagements with health care professionals and co-pay coupons cards. In March 2023, the California Department of Insurance issued a subpoena seeking records similar to those requested by the CID. Biohaven is a wholly-owned subsidiary that we acquired in October 2022. We are producing records in response to these requests.</p>
<h2>U.S. Department of Justice Inquiry relating to Mexico Operations</h2>

<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Xeljanz</h2>
<p>In April 2023, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia, in coordination with the Department of Justice's Commercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and information related to programs Pfizer sponsored in retail pharmacies relating to Xeljanz. We are producing records pursuant to this request.</p>
<h2>B. Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of October 1, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.</p>
<p>In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.</p>
<p>See Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.'s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.</p>
<p>We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.</p>
<h2>C. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions</h2>
<p>We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Note 13. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information</h2>
<h2>A. Segment Information</h2>
<p>We manage our commercial operations throughtwo operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that in cludes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with P fizer's R&amp;D focus areas. Bi opharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. In consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing our R&amp;D operations. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology is performed by a new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development (ORD) platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas is consolidated into the Pfizer Research and Development (PRD) platform function. ORD and PRD replace our former WRDM and Global Product Development (GPD) organizational design. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from ORD and PRD. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.</p>
<p>Other Business Activities and Reconciling Items-Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with: (i) R&amp;D and medical expenses managed by our ORD and PRD organizations; (ii) corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs; (iii) overhead costs primarily associated with our manufacturing operations; and (iv) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>Segment Assets-We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $215 billion as of October 1, 2023 and $197 billion as of December 31, 2022.</p>

<p>Remaining Performance Obligations-Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totaled approximately $9 billion as of October 1, 2023, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2023 through 2026, the timing of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.</p>
<p>Deferred Revenues-Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $3.2 billion as of October 1, 2023, with $2.1 billion and $1.0 billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The increase in Comirnaty deferred revenues during the first nine months of 2023 was primarily the result of additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the products to our customers. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recognized</p>
<h2>PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>(UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>revenue of approximately $140 million and $2.1 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of October 1, 2023 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues from 2024 through 2026. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of October 1, 2023 or December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>Note 14. Subsequent Event</h2>
<p>Amended Paxlovid Supply Agreement with the U.S. Government-On October 13, 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which will facilitate the expected transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in November 2023, with prices to be negotiated with commercial payers and a copay assistance program for eligible privately insured patients, as the U.S. government begins to discontinue the distribution of EUA-labeled Paxlovid. We will ensure commercial readiness by providing NDA-labeled commercial supply to all channels by the end of 2023. However, EUA-labeled Paxlovid will remain available free-ofcharge to all eligible patients until the end of 2023, and therefore, we expect only minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024. Components of this agreement include: (i) a non-cash return of any remaining EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory at the end of 2023, estimated to be 7.9 million treatment courses, with an associated revenue reversal of approximately $4.2 billion to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023; (ii) the conversion of those remaining EUA-labeled treatment courses previously purchased by the U.S. government to a volume-based credit, which will support continued access to Paxlovid through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by Pfizer (which will provide the estimated 7.9 million treatment courses of FDA-approved, NDA-labeled Paxlovid free of charge to all eligible uninsured, Medicare and Medicaid patients through 2024, and to eligible uninsured and underinsured patients through 2028); and (iii) the creation in 2024 of a U.S. Strategic National Stockpile of 1.0 million treatment courses to enable future pandemic preparedness through 2028, to be managed and supplied by Pfizer at no cost to the U.S. government or taxpayers. While we will recognize revenue as the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses are delivered, there is no cash compensation for these treatment courses.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p>The following MD&amp;A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>Our Business and Strategy --Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&amp;D and SI&amp;A to support Pfizer's near- and longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently acquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A .</p>
<p>Since inception through the third quarter of 2023, we have incurred substantially all costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&amp;D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3 . For a description of savings related to this program, see the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&amp;A .</p>
<p>In July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing our R&amp;D operations. See Note 13A .</p>
<p>In October 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. The program is expected to deliver annual net cost savings of at least $3.5 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is expected to be realized in 2023 and at least an additional $2.5 billion is expected to be realized in 2024 compared to the midpoint of SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expense guidance provided on August 1, 2023. The costs to achieve the savings associated with the new cost realignment program are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion, of which the majority is expected to be cash. These costs will primarily include severance and implementation costs. We will continue to refine the estimated savings and their associated costs over the remainder of the year and will incorporate them into our full-year guidance for 2024.</p>
<p>For additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Our Business Development Initiatives --We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business development activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2 , including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:</p>
<p>Proposed Acquisition of Telavant Holdings, Inc. (Telavant) --In October 2023, we and Roivant Sciences Ltd. (Roivant) entered into a definitive agreement with Roche Holdings Inc. (Roche) through which Roche would acquire Telavant for an upfront payment of $7.1 billion and a contingent milestone payment of $150 million. Roivant currently owns approximately 75% and we currently own approximately 25% of Telavant. Telavant was created through an arrangement between Roivant and us under which we out-licensed the global development and manufacturing rights and the U.S. and Japan commercialization rights to our anti-TL1a antibody PF-06480605, now RVT-3101, to Telavant in exchange for our ownership interest in Telavant and Roivant's agreement to fund the ongoing R&amp;D of RVT-3101. Under the original agreement, we retained commercialization rights to RVT-3101 outside of the U.S. and Japan and will continue to retain these rights after the acquisition of Telavant by Roche. In connection with this new transaction, Telavant's development, manufacturing and U.S. and Japan commercialization</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>rights will transfer to Roche. Roche's acquisition of Telavant is subject to customary closing conditions including U.S. anti-trust approval and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024. Upon closing of the transaction, we will receive a portion of the upfront cash payment from Roche based on our ownership interest and we will record a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.7 billion in Other (income)/deductions--net .</p>
<p>Agreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship) --In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by leveraging Flagship's ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and royalties for each successfully commercialized program.</p>
<p>For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 23, 2023, the filing date of our 2022 Form 10-K, see Note 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Our Third Quarter 2023 and First Nine Months of 2023 Performance</h2>
<p>Revenues --Revenues decreased $9.4 billion, or 42%, in the third quarter of 2023 to $13.2 billion from $22.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $9.3 billion, or 41%, as well as a de minimis impact of foreign exchange of $94 million. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 10%, operationally, reflecting U.S. revenues from Abrysvo following launch of the older adult indication; revenues from Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta; and strong growth from the Vyndaqel family and the Prevnar family.</p>
<p>Revenues decreased $31.8 billion, or 42%, int he first nine months of 2023 to $44.2 billion from $76.0 billion inth e first nine months of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $30.7 billion, or 40%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.1 billion, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 7%, operationally, reflecting revenues from Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta; strong growth from the Vyndaqel family; U.S. revenues from Abrysvo following launch of the older adult indication; and growth from the Prevnar family and Eliquis.</p>
<p>As of October 31, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $58 billion to $61 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 40% at the midpoint compared to 2022 revenues, due to expected revenue declines from our COVID-19 products, partially offset by expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, new product and indication launches and recently acquired products. We expect these revenue declines will also have an unfavorable impact on Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income .</p>
<p>See the Revenues by Geography and Revenues --Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. See also The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations, risks and uncertainties. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 13C .</p>
<p>Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income/(Loss) --Loss from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss) in the third quarter of 2023 was $3.4 billion, compared to income of $9.0 billion in the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower revenues and increases in Cost of sales and Amortization of intangible assets , partially offset by lower Acquired in-process research and development expenses.</p>
<p>The decrease in Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income of $24.3 billion, to $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023 from $29.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, was primarily due to lower revenues and increases in Selling, informational and administrative expenses and Amortization of intangible assets , partially offset by lower Cost of sales , lower Acquired in-process research and development expenses , lower net losses on equity securities and lower net interest expense.</p>
<p>See the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations section within MD&amp;A and Note 4 . See also The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations, risks and uncertainties. For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income/(Loss) section within MD&amp;A and Note 5 .</p>
<p>Our Operating Environment --We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below, as well as in the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook --Our Operating Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K and the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights --The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patentbased expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.</p>
<p>For additional information, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights and the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Intellectual Property Protection sections of our 2022 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 12A1 .</p>
<p>Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures --Governments globally, as well as private third-party payers in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, "international reference pricing" (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, began to be implemented in 2023 and implementation efforts will continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first round of medicines subject to the "Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program," which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the Federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Among the medicines included in the first round is Eliquis. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid program or the federal 340B drug pricing program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B program, could have a material impact on our business. See the Item 1. Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and -Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Pricing and Reimbursement sections, and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook--Our Operating Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K .</p>
<p>Impact of Recent Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC) --Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables-including anesthesia, analgesia, and micronutrients-which is nearly eight percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the majority of the facility's manufacturing lines have restarted. This expedited restart is the first step toward full recovery for the facility, as Pfizer restarts production through a phased approach, with full production across the site's three manufacturing suites anticipated by the end of 2023. While manufacturing has resumed, the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through at least mid-2024.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded $209 million to Cost of sales for inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the facility could not operate, and incremental costs resulting from the tornado damage. We continue to evaluate the financial impact of the tornado on our business and may record additional losses and/or costs in future periods in order to bring our facility fully back online, but we are unable to predict them, along with insurance recoveries, with certainty at this time.</p>
<p>Product Supply --We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls, including our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and additional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit, and may lead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.</p>
<p>Except for the recent tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first nine months of 2023 and to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels; however, we continue to see heightened demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on</p>
<p>risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The Global Economic Environment --In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook --The Global Economic Environment section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>COVID-19 --In response to COVID-19, we have developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty, including an Omicron XBB.1.5adapted monovalent vaccine. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant additional investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 2023 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts. In September 2023, Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S., triggered by the expiration of current contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to start transitioning to commercial markets in 2024.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 2023 and to date, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies and distributors. Internationally, for Paxlovid, we are continuing the transition to commercial markets and are expecting most revenue to be generated through commercial channels in 2024. On October 13, 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which will facilitate the expected transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in November 2023, with minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product expected before January 1, 2024. See Note 14 .</p>
<p>To date, the majority of demand for our COVID-19 products in 2023 has been fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of October 31, 2023, we forecasted Comirnaty revenues of approximately $11.5 billion in 2023, down 70% from 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and Paxlovid revenues of approximately $1 billion in 2023, down 95% from 2022 results. This forecast reflects an expected $9 billion revenue decline, composed of $7 billion for Paxlovid and $2 billion for Comirnaty, versus forecasted revenues as of August 1, 2023, primarily due to an expected $4.2 billion non-cash sales-return of EUA-labeled Paxlovid from the U.S. government, lower-than-expected vaccination- and infection-rates, and delayed commercialization in the U.S. for Paxlovid. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand, which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, number of symptomatic infections, and market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid.</p>

Risk Factors-COVID-19, -Intellectual Property Protection and -Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims sections and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10K, as well as Notes 8A , 12A1 , 13 and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section of this Form 10-Q .</p>
<p>Israel/Hamas Conflict --Our global operations may be impacted by the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023. For both the nine months ended October 1, 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the business of our Israel subsidiary represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets. We are closely monitoring developments in this conflict, including evaluating potential impacts to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. At this time, impacts to the Company are uncertain and subject to change given the volatile nature of the situation.</p>
<p>Russia/Ukraine Conflict --Our global operations may be impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For both the nine months ended October 1, 2023 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any significant negative impacts on our business from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers, including financial institutions, in response to such measures could adversely affect the global macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of</p>
<p>operations. For additional information on our response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as risks associated with the conflict, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section of the MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Emerging markets revenues decreased $927 million, or 28%, in the third quarter of 2023 to $2.4 billion from $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $780 million, or 24%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 4%. The operational decrease in emerging markets was primarily driven by declines from Comirnaty and Paxlovid as well as lower Sulperazon revenues largely driven by volume-based procurement in China, partially offset by growth from Eliquis and Lorbrena.</p>

<p>Revenue Deductions --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-overyear individual product revenue growth trends.</p>

<h2>Cost of Sales</h2>
<p>Cost of sales increased $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a non-cash charge of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for inventory write-offs and related charges ($4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $0.9 billion for Comirnaty); and</li>
<li>· $209 million in inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the facility could not operate, and incremental costs resulting from tornado damage to our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a reduction of $2.6 billion due to lower sales of Comirnaty; and</li>
<li>· a reduction of $405 million due to lower sales of Paxlovid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost of sales decreased $7.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023, mainly due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a reduction of $12.7 billion due to lower sales of Comirnaty; and</li>
<li>· a reduction of $1.2 billion due to lower sales of Paxlovid,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a non-cash charge of $5.8 billion for inventory write-offs and related charges ($4.8 billion for Paxlovid and $1.0 billion for Comirnaty); and</li>
<li>· $209 million in inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the facility could not operate, and incremental costs resulting from tornado damage to our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2023 was mainly driven by the non-cash charge of $5.6 billion discussed above, partially offset to a much lesser extent by favorable changes in sales mix.</p>
<h2>Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative expenses decreased $109 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a decrease of $325 million due to a lower provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid; and</li>
<li>· a $140 million decrease in spending on products across multiple customer groups,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an increase of $320 million for marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired and launched products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an increase of $780 million in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired and launched products;</li>
<li>· an increase of $450 million for the expected Paxlovid commercial launch;</li>
<li>· a $285 million increase in spending on products across multiple customer groups; and</li>
<li>· an increase of $200 million in our liability to be paid to participants of our supplemental savings plan,</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· a decrease of $490 million due to a lower provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Research and development expenses increased $14 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· increased investments of $280 million, mainly to develop recently acquired assets, as well as activities to support upcoming product launches,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a decrease of $260 million mainly due to lower compensation-related expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research and development expenses increased $51 million in the first nine months of 2023,primarily driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· increased costs of $560 million to develop recently acquired assets, activities to support upcoming product launches as well as ongoing late stage internal medicine programs,</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· lower spending of $430 million mainly for ongoing late stage vaccine and hospital programs as well as lower compensation-related expenses; and</li>
<li>· a decrease of $80 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer's common stock.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Acquired in-process research and development expenses decreased $457 million in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased $759 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of an upfront payment of $426 million related to the closing of the acquisition of ReViral Ltd. in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease for the first nine months of 2023 also reflects the non-recurrence of (i) an upfront payment to Biohaven and a premium paid on our equity investment in Biohaven totaling $263 million and (ii) a $76 million premium paid on our equity investment in BioNTech to develop a potential mRNA vaccine against shingles, both recorded in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<h2>Amortization of Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Amortization of intangible assets increased $357 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $987 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result of amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT, as well as higher amortization of intangible assets related to Prevnar, partially offset by fully amortized assets.</p>
<h2>Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<p>Transforming to a More Focused Company Program --For a description of our program, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see Note 3A . The program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations. In connection with restructuring our corporate enabling functions, we achieved gross cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, in the two year period from 2021 through 2022. In connection with transforming our commercial go-to market strategy, we expect net cost savings of $1.4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2022 through 2024. In connection with manufacturing network optimization, we expect net cost savings of $550 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through 2023. In connection with optimizing our end-to-end R&amp;D operations, we expect net cost savings of $2.3 billion to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2025.</p>
<p>Certain qualifying costs for this program in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income/(Loss). See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income/(Loss) section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In addition to this program, we continuously monitor our operations for cost-reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. In October 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook --Our Business and Strategy section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<h2>Other (Income)/Deductions-Net</h2>
<p>The favorable period-over-period change of $19 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2022, was primarily driven by (i) a gain on the divestiture of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio to Alexion in the third quarter of 2023 (see Note 2B ), (ii) the non-recurrence of an asset impairment charge incurred in the third quarter of 2022, and (iii) equity income from our investment in Haleon in the third quarter of 2023 versus equity losses in the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by (iv) higher net losses on equity securities, and (v) lower net periodic benefit credits associated with pension and postretirement plans recorded in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The favorable period-over-period change of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2023, compared to the first nine months of 2022, was primarily driven by (i) lower net losses on equity securities, (ii) lower net interest expense, (iii) a gain on the divestiture of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio to Alexion (see Note 2B ), and (iv) higher dividend income.</p>

<h2>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<p>A comprehensive update of Pfizer's development pipeline was published as of October 31, 2023 and is available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.</p>
<p>This section provides information as of the date of this filing about significant marketing application-related regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU and Japan.</p>
<p>The tables below include filing and approval milestones for products that have occurred in the last twelve months and generally do not include approvals that may have occurred prior to that time. The tables include filings with regulatory decisions pending (even if the filing occurred outside of the last twelve-month period).</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Vaccine Products</h2>
<p>Beginning with the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, initially authorized for emergency use, to Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA, 20232024 Formula), approved by the FDA for individuals 12 years and older and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (2023-2024 Formula) authorized by the FDA for emergency use for individuals 6 months through 11 years of age, efforts to stay current with circulating COVID-19 strains have resulted in the rapid development of targeted, adapted vaccines for licensure in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets. The adapted vaccines have included two bivalent formulations (Original and Omicron BA.1, not authorized in the U.S., and Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5). As updated COVID-19 vaccines are formulated to more closely target currently circulating vaccines, prior vaccine formulations are generally no longer utilized in a majority of the markets.</p>
<p>The 2023-2024 Formula includes a monovalent (single) component that corresponds to the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). T he table below summarizes the approval of the 2023-2024 Formula in the markets indicated:</p>

<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME/(LOSS)</h2>
<p>Adjusted income/(loss) is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income/(loss), certain components of Adjusted income/(loss) and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>Adjusted income/(loss) and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS/(LPS) are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS/(LPS) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholdersdiluted , respectively.</p>
<p>We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&amp;D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Income/(Loss) and Adjusted Diluted EPS/(LPS)</h2>
<p>Amortization of Intangible Assets -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes all amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Acquisition-Related Items -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.</p>
<p>Discontinued Operations -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the</p>
<p>Adjusted income/(loss) measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.</p>
<p>Certain Significant Items -Adjusted income/(loss) excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information-Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items and the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We believe as a result of this, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows , Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity , and the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows section within MD&amp;A. For information on our money market funds, available-for sale-debt securities and long-term debt, see Note 7 .</p>
<p>For information about our diverse sources of funds, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual and other obligations, global economic conditions, market risk and LIBOR, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12B .</p>
<p>Debt Issuance --In May 2023, we completed a public offering of $31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes as part of the financing for our proposed acquisition of Seagen. The net proceeds have been invested in short-term investments in a combination of money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities until the completion of the proposed acquisition. See Notes 7A and 7D .</p>
<p>Credit Ratings --The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&amp;P and Moody's. In March 2023, following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Seagen, Moody's changed its outlook on our long-term debt to Negative; S&amp;P downgraded our short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1. In October 2023, following the announcement of the amended Paxlovid supply agreement with the U.S. government and updated 2023 guidance, S&amp;P changed its outlook on our longterm debt to Negative.</p>

<p>Debt Capacity--Lines of Credit --As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had access to a total of $15 billion in committed U.S. revolving credit facilities, consisting of an $8.0 billion facility maturing in November 2024 and a $7 billion facility maturing in November 2028, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our global commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facilities, our lenders have provided us an additional $298 million in lines of credit, of which $268 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>Capital Allocation Framework --Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to facilitate the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&amp;D investments and business development activities and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to finance the proposed acquisition of Seagen substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. See Note 1A and the Item 1A. Risk Factors section for additional information about our proposed acquisition of Seagen. On October 4, 2023, our BOD declared a dividend of $0.41 per share, payable on December 4, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2023. At October 1, 2023, our remaining share-purchase authorization was $3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first nine months of 2023. See Note 12 in our 2022 Form 10-K for more information on our publicly announced share-purchase plans.</p>
<p>Our financing plan for Seagen does not involve monetizing any portion of our Haleon stake. Our intentions with respect to our Haleon stake are set out in our Schedule 13D (as amended) initially filed with the SEC on July 27, 2022.</p>

We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified below, as well as those discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in our 2022 Form 10-K, the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q and within MD&amp;A. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The occurrence of any of the risks identified below, in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in our 2022 Form 10-K, the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of this Form 10-Q or within MD&amp;A, or other risks currently unknown, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, or we may be required to increase our accruals for contingencies.

<h2>ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the discussion in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our</p>
<p>disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II. OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p>Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 12A .</p>
<h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>We refer to the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our Operating Environment and -The Global Economic Environment sections and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results section within MD&amp;A of this Form 10-Q and of our 2022 Form 10-K and to the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K. We are including the following risk factors, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SEAGEN</h2>
<p>We may be unable to complete the acquisition of Seagen within the anticipated timeframe or at all, which could prevent us from receiving the anticipated benefits from the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all.</p>
<p>On March 12, 2023, we entered into a merger agreement with Seagen. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. As a result, there is no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe or at all. In addition, Pfizer may be required to pay Seagen a reverse termination fee of approximately $2.22 billion, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated by either party as a result of certain antitrust and/or foreign direct investment law-related conditions. Any failure to consummate the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all could prevent Pfizer from receiving the expected benefits from the acquisition. See Note 1 and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<h2>We have expended and will continue to expend significant time and resources in connection with the acquisition of Seagen and have incurred substantial indebtedness to fund the acquisition.</h2>
<p>Pfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and expenses related to the acquisition of Seagen, many of which must be paid regardless of whether the acquisition is consummated. For example, such time, resources and expenses are being and will continue to be incurred in connection with seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction. We intend to finance a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, plus additional short-term indebtedness to be issued prior to the acquisition, which indebtedness may limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position.</p>
<p>We may not be successful in identifying and executing potential business development transactions, such as our acquisition of Seagen, or realizing the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any historical or potential business development transaction, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our growth objectives.</p>
<p>We have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by accelerating revenue growth by not only advancing our own product pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our proposed acquisition of Seagen is part of that accelerated revenue growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. The success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy or waive closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes, or at all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt</p>
<p>financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings or limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position. The success of our business development transactions depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including the possibility that the expected benefits from such transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products, product pipeline and acquired products or businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings, such as those expected with respect to Seagen, within expected time frames or at all, which may impact our ability to meet our growth objectives. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time, which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.</p>
