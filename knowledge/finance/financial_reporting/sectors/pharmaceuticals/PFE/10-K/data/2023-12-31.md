<p>capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.</p>
<p>On December 14, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines. With the addition of Seagen's pipeline and its four in-line medicines (Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa and Tivdak), Pfizer's oncology portfolio spans multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics and other immunotherapies. In addition to the acquisition of Seagen, our significant recent business development activities in 2023 include, among others, the September 2023 divestiture of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio to Alexion. For a further discussion of our strategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&amp;A and Note 2 .</p>
<h2>COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>In 2023, we managed our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative sciencebased biopharmaceutical business, and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, an offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with our R&amp;D focus areas. In 2023, Biopharma was the only reportable segment. The commercial structure within Biopharma included three broad customer groups in 2023: Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2024, we made changes in our commercial organization to incorporate Seagen and improve focus, speed and execution. Specifically, within our Biopharma reportable segment we created the Pfizer Oncology Division, the Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division, and the Pfizer International Commercial Division:</p>

<h2>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>R&amp;D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the medicines and vaccines that may be the most impactful for patients. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&amp;D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their safety, efficacy and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Our R&amp;D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&amp;D priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;</li>
<li>· advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&amp;D leadership; and</li>
<li>· advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>To that end, our R&amp;D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas, which are inflammation and immunology, internal medicine, oncology, rare diseases, vaccines, and antiinfectives.</p>
<p>While a significant portion of our R&amp;D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our portfolio. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with universities, biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments. These collaboration, alliance and license agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge, risk and cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and inlicensed or acquired products. For information on certain of these collaborations, alliances and license arrangements and investments, see Note 2 .</p>
<p>Our R&amp;D Operations. In 2023, we continued to strengthen our global R&amp;D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&amp;D productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&amp;D activity is conducted through various platform functions that support our global operations. Beginning in July 2023, in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, we reorganized our R&amp;D platform operations. Discovery to late-phase clinical development for oncology is performed by a new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development (ORD) organization and discovery to late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas is consolidated into the end-to-end Pfizer Research and Development (PRD) organization. ORD and PRD replace our former WRDM and GPD organizations, where, prior to July 2023, research units within WRDM were generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets and, prior to July 2023, GPD was generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early- and late-stage clinical assets in Pfizer's pipeline. In 2023, Biopharma received R&amp;D services from ORD, PRD and the predecessor WRDM and GPD organizations. These services included IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products.</p>
<p>We manage R&amp;D operations on a total-company basis through our PRD and ORD organizations described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Management Team, currently led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and composed of other senior executives, is accountable for aligning resources across PRD and ORD, and for helping to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative R&amp;D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.</p>
<p>We do not disaggregate total R&amp;D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage all of our R&amp;D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period information about R&amp;D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.</p>
<p>For additional information on our R&amp;D operations, including R&amp;D related costs and expenses, see the Costs and Expenses -Research and Development Expenses section within MD&amp;A and Note 17 .</p>
<p>Our R&amp;D Pipeline. The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years. As of January 30, 2024, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&amp;D:</p>
<p>Pipeline 2023 10-K.jpg</p>
<p>Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our product candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug and vaccine candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A. The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. For information on the risks associated with R&amp;D, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Research and Development section.</p>
<h2>COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS</h2>
<p>We use collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements to enhance our development, R&amp;D, sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products, which include, among others, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Comirnaty is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19, which is being jointly developed and commercialized with BioNTech. Pfizer and BioNTech equally share the costs of development for the Comirnaty program. Comirnaty has been granted an approval or an authorization in many countries around the world in populations varying by country. We also share gross profits equally from commercialization of Comirnaty and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For discussion on Comirnaty, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-COVID-19 section within MD&amp;A.</li>
<li>· Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In</li>
</ul>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage.</li>
<li>· Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with SMPA. The companies are also collaborating on Myfembree (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women and the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in premenopausal women. The companies equally share profits and allowable expenses in the U.S. for Orgovyx, and in the U.S. and Canada for Myfembree. Pfizer does not have rights outside of these markets. SMPA remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet.</li>
<li>· Padcev (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) is a first-in-class ADC that is directed to Nectin-4, a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer, that is being codeveloped and jointly commercialized with Astellas. In the U.S., Padcev has been approved for use with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. Other approvals and indications for Padcev vary by market. In the U.S., the companies jointly promote, and we record net sales and are responsible for all U.S. distribution activities for Padcev. The companies each bear the costs of their own sales organizations in the U.S., and equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing and any profits realized in the U.S. for Padcev. Outside the U.S., we have commercialization rights in all countries in North and South America, and Astellas has commercialization rights in the rest of the world. The agreement between us and Astellas provides that the companies will effectively equally share in profits realized in markets outside of the U.S. through: (i) a costs-incurred and profit-sharing mechanism based on product sales and costs of commercialization in certain markets and (ii) a royalty-payment mechanism intended to approximate an equal profit share for both parties in the remaining markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we have collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements with respect to certain other biopharmaceutical products, including Adcetris and Tivdak as a result of our acquisition of Seagen.</p>
<p>Revenues associated with these arrangements are included in Alliance revenues (except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues for Comirnaty and Padcev, which are included in Product revenues ). In addition, we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline products that are in development stage, including, among others certain of those described in the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A. For further discussion of collaboration and co-promotion agreements, see the Item 1. Business-Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section , the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Collaborations and Other Relationships with Third Parties section and Notes 2 and 17 .</p>
<h2>INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>Our operations are conducted globally, and we supply our medicines and vaccines to approximately 200 countries and territories. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products.</p>
<p>Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $31.4 billion accounted for 54% of Total revenues in 2023. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 14, 24 and 21 countries outside the U.S. in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the number of countries exceeding $500 million in revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by decreases in revenues related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid. As a percentage of Total revenues , our largest country outside the U.S. was Japan in 2023. For a geographic breakdown of Total revenues , see the Total Revenues by Geography section within MD&amp;A and Note 17B .</p>
<p>1122</p>
<p>Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Global Operations and Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections.</p>
<h2>SALES AND MARKETING</h2>
<p>Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid in 2022 and 2023, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In 2022 and 2023, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies. Our vaccines in the U.S. are primarily sold directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Our vaccines outside the U.S. are primarily sold to government and non-government institutions. Certain of these government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity. Our</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, which are binding contracts, represented a significant amount of revenues in 2022 and 2023. Sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. transitioned to commercial channels in the second half of 2023. For information on our October 2023 amended agreement with the U.S. government regarding Paxlovid, see Note 17C .</p>
<p>We also seek to gain access for our products on formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payors on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas. For information on our significant customers, see Note 17C .</p>
<p>We promote our products to healthcare providers and patients consistent with applicable laws. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers and patients; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, integrated delivery systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. In the U.S., we market directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues and our patient assistance programs.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in a manner they prefer, we take an omnichannel approach, including both virtual and in person interactions, and see generally positive customer response to both approaches.</p>
<h2>PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Patents . We own or have co-promotion and/or license rights related to a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products, their uses, formulations, and product manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies. Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product's approval due to the regulatory requirements, while patent term adjustment may be available in some countries to compensate for administrative delays during prosecution of patents. One of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products, although international and U.S. free trade agreements have included some global protection of intellectual property rights. See the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.</p>
<p>In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs or vaccines upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.</p>
<p>Based on current sales and other factors, and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires, are as follows:</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>

<li>Unless otherwise indicated, the years pertain to the basic product patent expiration, including granted PTEs, supplementary protection certificates (SPC) or pediatric exclusivity periods. SPCs are included when granted in three out of five major European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.). Noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the U.S. or Japan and/or SPC application in Europe, the term of which, if granted, may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products which may or may not protect our product from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

<p>remaining generic companies and following the resolution of the litigation in our favor, the three generic companies are not permitted to launch their products until the 2031 expiration date of the formulation patent. Both the composition of matter patent expiring in November 2026 and the formulation patent expiring in 2031 may be subject to future challenges. While we cannot predict the outcome of any potential future litigation, there are certain potential alternatives that might occur which could potentially permit generic launch prior to April 1, 2028: (i) if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, through appeal, the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant would be permitted to launch on November 21, 2026; or (ii) if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in future litigation, through appeal, the settled generic companies and any successful future litigant could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision.

<p>Loss of Intellectual Property Rights. The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we typically lose exclusivity on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time. Also, if one of our product-related patents is found to be invalid by judicial, court or regulatory or administrative proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced, resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. Additionally, we could be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights infringe third party patents.</p>
<p>Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2024 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. There is no assurance that a particular product will maintain market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates included in this Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance. For additional information on the impact of LOEs on our revenues, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our 2023 Performance section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Competitive Products, -Intellectual Property Protection and -Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims sections and Note 16A1 .</p>
<p>Trademarks . Our products are sold under brand-name and logo trademarks and trade dress. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others, for as long as it is registered. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to us.</p>

<h2>COMPETITION</h2>
<p>Our business is conducted in intensely competitive and highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. Though the means of competition vary among our products, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.</p>
<p>We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat or prevent diseases or indications similar to those treated or prevented by our major products. These competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&amp;D and their successful R&amp;D could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of our products in development, as well as product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&amp;D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration.</p>
<p>To help address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&amp;D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong and differentiated product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug or vaccine approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value of our products for the conditions they treat or prevent, as well as investigating potential new applications. We educate patients, physicians, payors and global health authorities on the benefits and risks of our medicines and vaccines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including our efforts to effectively launch and market our products to our customers.</p>
<p>Operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our ethical approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals and medical education grants. We also continue to support programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions. For example, in May 2022, we launched An Accord for a Healthier World, which aims to provide our full portfolio of patented and off-patent medicines and vaccines for which Pfizer holds global rights on a not-forprofit basis to 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries around the world.</p>
<p>Our vaccines have and may continue to face competition, including from the introduction of alternative vaccines or "next-generation" vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents, which may adversely affect our future results.</p>
<p>Our biosimilars, which include biosimilars of certain inflammation &amp; immunology and oncology biologic medicines, compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a "first-to-market" or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lowercost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market.</p>
<p>Generic Products . Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent protection and often charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&amp;D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the approval process in the U.S. and in the EU exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. In China, for example, given the expansion of the QCE process and continuation of the VBP program, we expect to continue to face intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2024 and beyond, which has and may continue to result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors' branded products have and may continue to compete with our products.</p>
<p>Commercial and government payors typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. Similar rules also apply in several EU member states, where national authorities typically encourage and incentivize the use of generic products.</p>
<p>Biosimilars. Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines. In the U.S., biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved by the FDA under the U.S. Public Health Service Act, whereas in the EU the EMA is responsible for evaluating the majority of applications for biosimilars through the centralized procedure.</p>
<h2>PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS</h2>
<p>Commercial Pricing Pressures. Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. Many employers have adopted or make available high deductible health plans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payors, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates for payors and a reduction in demand for our products, including denial of coverage of our products, if lower cost alternatives are available. Payors often require significant discounts, or rebates, from our prices in exchange for more favorable formulary placement. Pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive biopharmaceutical markets and increasing concentration of insurers and PBMs. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.</p>
<p>Longer term, we foresee a shift in focus among payors and their PBMs away from fee-for-service reimbursement towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions. Further, these models may also encourage payors and their PBMs to cover higher cost drugs where coverage is tied to patient outcomes and other quality incentives.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The impact of large-scale healthcare disruptions, like the COVID-19 pandemic, on the pace of adoption of value-based payment models remains unclear. Both payors and providers may resist adopting such models or choose to adopt such models at a slower pace if the incentives available do not outweigh the financial risk involved. Adoption of such models, in particular models that involve downside risk, may depend on revenue predictability for hospitals and other institutional providers, many of which are still struggling to recover financially following the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers in more advanced value-based payment models, such as full capitation, a fixed amount paid in advance per-patient per-unit of timeperiod, generally found their revenues remained steady during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may ultimately encourage the growth of such models. Going forward, we expect continued focus on value-based payment models that support financial resiliency and advance healthcare equity by incorporating features intended to reduce disparities in healthcare quality and access experienced by underrepresented and underserved populations.</p>
<p>We believe medicines and vaccines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines and vaccines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system. This includes assessing our go-to market model to help address patient affordability challenges. We have engaged with major payors and the U.S. government to explore opportunities to improve access and reimbursement in an effort to drive pro-patient policies. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payors throughout the productdevelopment process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. Further, we are developing stronger support designed to demonstrate the net value of the medicines and vaccines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture.</p>
<p>For information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors -Pricing and Reimbursement sections.</p>
<p>Managed Care Organizations. The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 318 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger MCOs, which enhances those MCOs' ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their importance to our business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices, as well as negatively impacted revenues.</p>
<p>MCOs and their PBMs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinical protocols (which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on highertier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer to the patient higher patient out-of-pocket expenses. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. We expect payment reforms for MCOs will continue to evolve with increased emphasis on expanded participation and on removing barriers to equitable healthcare.</p>
<p>The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. MCOs emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors' offices and clinics as ways to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs that can help in chronic care management and reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. At the same time, MCOs may seek to exclude high-cost drugs from formularies in their efforts to manage and lower their costs.</p>
<p>Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. We continue to seek to ensure that our major products are included on MCO formularies. However, our branded products are increasingly being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. Continuing efforts by managed care entities to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect demand for our products and our financial performance. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Managed Care Trends section.</p>
<h2>RAW MATERIALS</h2>
<p>We procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide. In general, these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers. No significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2024. However, we continue to see heightened demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.</p>
<h2>GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS</h2>
<p>We are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing the operations of biopharmaceutical companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and price reporting, interactions with healthcare professionals, institutions, and referral sources, reporting of remuneration provided to healthcare providers and academic medical centers, financial assistance provided to patients, clinical research, data privacy and information security, among others. These laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm to our reputation and business. See Note 16A . Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.</p>
<h2>In the U.S.</h2>
<p>Drug and Biologic Regulation . The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and postmarketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products and devices. The regulations govern areas such as safety and efficacy, clinical trials, advertising and promotion, quality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products and activities.</p>
<p>For a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product, including vaccines, the FDA must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. If the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the FDA will approve the product's NDA or BLA (or supplemental NDA or supplemental BLA), as appropriate.</p>
<p>A drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements, which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs (the FDA regulations that govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the law that, among other things, sets forth requirements related to product tracing, product identifiers and verification for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, re-packagers and dispensers to facilitate the tracing of product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain), as well as advertising and promotion regulations. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and -PostAuthorization/Approval Data sections.</p>
<p>In the context of public health emergencies, like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply to the FDA for an EUA which, if granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during the declared emergency, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the EUA is terminated by the government. Although the criteria for an EUA differ from the criteria for approval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of ongoing obligations. The FDA generally expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as a BLA or an NDA, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Biosimilar Regulation. The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics, or reference products, are entitled to 12 years exclusivity. Applications for biosimilars may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and may not be approved until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed.</p>
<p>Sales and Marketing Regulations . Our marketing practices are subject to federal and state laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), Civil Monetary Penalties Law and False Claims Act, intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The AKS prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law covers a variety of conduct, often violations under other laws, and includes penalties for AKS violations as well as causing the submission of false claims. The False Claims Act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services, including to government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent including false certifications of compliance with applicable law. The federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.</p>
<p>Pricing, Reimbursement and Access Regulations. Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded or to expand controls on drug pricing, government reimbursement, and access to medicines and vaccines on public and private insurance plans could have a material impact on us.</p>
<p>We must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various government programs including Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration and the 340B Drug Pricing Program (340B Program). We also must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Product Revenue Deductions section within MD&amp;A and Note 1G .</p>
<p>The drug pricing provisions of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, began to be implemented in 2022 and implementation will continue over the next several years. The IRA includes several provisions to lower prescription drug costs for Medicare patients and to reduce drug spending by the federal government. Among other things, the IRA enhances the Medicare Part D benefit by eliminating the coverage gap ("donut hole") beginning in 2025, adds a maximum out-of-pocket cap for Medicare beneficiaries (set at $2,000 for 2025), and creates a new program that allows patients to pay their cost-sharing over time. The law also requires manufacturers to provide a 10% discount on branded prescriptions in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase, imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D on drug price increases that outpace inflation, and directs HHS to set the prices of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare (known as the "Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program"). In August 2023, the Biden Administration published the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which included Eliquis. As a selected drug, CMS will establish a "maximum fair price" for Eliquis and that price will be published by September 1, 2024. The price will be in effect in 2026. The maximum fair price established by CMS is required to be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340B Program if that maximum fair price is lower than the discounted price such entities are offered under the 340B Program ceiling price calculation. In addition, there will be a new Medicare manufacturer discount program agreement expected to be signed in March 2024 that will change our discounting obligations for all medicines in Medicare, with few exceptions, beginning in 2025. The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore, the outcome of the Program remains uncertain. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or the 340B Program could have a material impact on our business. For example, certain changes finalized by CMS in a December 2020 final rule, including which products qualify as so-called "line extension" drugs subject to increased rebate liability, may have a material impact on our business. Additionally, in May 2023, CMS proposed new rules that could, if finalized, have a material impact on our business. Those proposals include, for example, new rules regarding how manufacturers would be required to aggregate discounts for purposes of determining their Medicaid Best Price. Additionally, various potential changes to the 340B Program are undergoing</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>review or are the subject of current regulatory activity and/or litigation, and their status is unclear. In 2022, we implemented a policy that will help improve contract pharmacy integrity. The HHS Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers the 340B Program, has sent letters to numerous manufacturers that have also implemented contract pharmacy policies and integrity initiatives; the letters express HRSA's view that those manufacturers' policies are in violation of the 340B statute. HRSA also has referred some of those other manufacturers to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) for potential enforcement action. Pfizer has not received an enforcement letter from HRSA to date relating to our 340B Program integrity initiative. Several manufacturers have challenged HRSA's enforcement letters in federal court and litigation is ongoing in those cases. We believe that our policy is consistent with the statute. In addition, some states have enacted laws seeking to restrict manufacturer policies related to contract pharmacy transactions in their states. At least one state has begun to pursue enforcement proceedings under its law. Several stakeholders have challenged such laws in certain states. Other states have considered and could enact similar laws going forward, although any such laws also may be subject to legal challenges. Additional legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B Program may have an adverse impact on our integrity initiative, and we may face enforcement action or penalties, depending upon such developments. The 340B Program continues to be a subject of regulatory activity, congressional scrutiny and inquiries, litigation, and other developments, any or all of which could affect the scope of the program and Pfizer's obligation to offer discounts to 340B Program covered entities under the program. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Pricing and Reimbursement section.</p>
<p>States seek to control healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state regulated healthcare programs. A majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. States may seek to negotiate supplemental rebate agreements that are larger than the minimum federal requirement for preferred formulary access. Preferred access to our products under the Medicaid managed care programs are often determined by the managed care health plans contracted by the state to administer benefits, which may also require supplemental rebates for preferred formulary access. We expect states will continue to seek cost cutting, which may focus on managed care capitation payments, supplemental rebates, and/or formulary management.</p>
<p>We expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing and access to medicine, in addition to actions already taken, which could result in legislative and regulatory changes. Government and private payors routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. There is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and actions being taken at the state and federal level. Further efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, such as Florida's drug importation program which was recently authorized by the FDA, limit reimbursement to lower reference prices, require deep discounts, impose financial penalties related to pricing practices, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase, could adversely affect our business if implemented. Further, commercial payors often follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies when setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in cost or other containment measures may similarly be adopted by commercial plans. Payors may continue to promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price competition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Managed Care Trends section.</p>
<p>Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.</p>
<p>Data Privacy. The number of privacy and data security laws and regulations in the U.S. to which we are subject on the federal and state level continues to increase. We routinely collect and use sensitive personal information relating to digital health. The legislative, regulatory and litigation landscape for privacy and data protection requirements is rapidly evolving and changing. These requirements are not universal and can conflict between jurisdictions. Compliance with those laws and regulations is made more complex by the lack of consistent standards, common definitions, or clear regulatory expectations. At the same time, enforcement of these laws and regulations is increasing and litigation is becoming more common. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including cybersecurity breaches or incidents, could subject us to significant fines and penalties, litigation, and negatively impact our reputation.</p>
<h2>Outside the U.S.</h2>
<p>New Drug Approvals . In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products that are eligible for the centralized marketing authorization procedure. Through the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies may submit to the EMA a single application for a marketing authorization valid in all the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. The EC takes a legally binding decision based on the EMA's recommendation. For medicinal products that are not eligible for the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure is based on the recognition of a pre-existing national marketing authorization by one or more EU member states, and the decentralized procedure allows the submission of a marketing authorization application simultaneously in several EU member states. In the U.K., the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is the sole regulatory authority. In Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. In China, the National Medical Product Administration is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income countries might require marketing approval or scientific opinions by a recognized regulatory authority (e.g., the FDA or EMA) before they begin reviewing or approving applications. By way of example, the EMA, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), can provide scientific opinions on high priority human medicines, including vaccines, for markets outside the EU.</p>
<p>In April 2023, the EC proposed to revise the EU pharmaceutical legislation. The proposed legislation includes a significant focus on tackling inequalities on access, affordability and availability of medicines across the EU. The legislative process is ongoing and when eventually completed, it is likely to be the largest reform in over 20 years to EU medicines regulation, with a wide range of impacts including on approval procedures, regulatory data protection and environmental protection measures.</p>
<p>Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the EMA's PRAC is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues. Specifically, the PRAC focuses on detecting, assessing and communicating the risks associated with adverse reactions of medicinal products, while considering their therapeutic effects. It also evaluates post-authorization safety studies and conducts pharmacovigilance audits. Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.</p>
<p>Pricing and Reimbursement . Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, "international reference pricing" (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In addition, the international patchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some third-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations such as the WHO scrutinize international pharmaceutical pricing through policy recommendations and sponsorship of programs, such as "The Oslo Medicines Initiative" (OMI) which aims to ensure "affordability for high-priced medicines". The OMI concluded its work in September 2022, and the WHO/Europe Access to Novel Medicines Platform was established to enhance affordable and equitable access to effective, innovative and high-priced medicinal products in the region.</p>
<p>In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years because of an overall focus on healthcare cost containment with the central government emphasizing improved health outcomes and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards its healthcare reform. State owned hospitals and the state insurance program account for the vast majority of all drug purchases. For patented innovative products, drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs (including oncology medicines, medicines for children and orphan drugs) to the National Reimbursement Drug List via access-price negotiation. A centralized VBP program with a tendering process aims to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE. This has resulted in further lowering the price of medicines, especially off-patent medicines; this trend is expected to continue. China is increasing its use of Health Technology Assessment and is controlling mark-ups within the country using a two-invoice limited system, which is a government policy that regulates the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Pfizer, along with most off-patent originators, have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs (including biological products) could be subjected to VBP qualification in future rounds. Certain of our products, such as Sulperazon and Vfend injectables, were included as candidates in VBP rounds in 2023, and Pfizer was not successful in the bidding process for such products. While certain details of future QCE expansion have been made available, we are unable to determine the impact on our business of the various pricing measures underway.</p>
<p>Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or industry trade associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations, such as academic teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property . Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&amp;D investment. The WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property-related protection for pharmaceutical products by law, with a time-limited exemption provided for least-developed countries. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.</p>
<p>While the global intellectual property policy environment has generally improved following implementation of WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on maintaining those standards and further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, pursuant to the ongoing review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, proposals introduced in 2023 may reduce the basic period of regulatory data protection from eight to six years, subject to the outcome of the ongoing legislative procedure. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals. Multilateral institutions continue to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 response, as well as pandemic preparedness and access to medicine more generally.</p>
<p>Considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for all innovative industries (both domestic and foreign) and helping improve patients' access to innovative medicines and vaccines.</p>
<p>Data Privacy. We are subject to extensive privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world concerning the collection, use and sharing of personal data. We routinely collect and use sensitive personal information relating to digital health. The legislative, regulatory and litigation landscape for privacy and data protection requirements is rapidly evolving and changing. These requirements are not universal and can conflict between jurisdictions. Compliance with those laws and regulations is made more complex by the lack of consistent standards, common definitions, or clear regulatory expectations. At the same time, enforcement of these laws and regulations is increasing and fines and penalties are also increasing. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including cybersecurity breaches or incidents, could subject us to significant fines and penalties, litigation, and negatively impact our reputation.</p>
<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>Our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2023 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $92 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $158 million in other environment-related expenses.</p>
<p>While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or financial position. See also Note 16A3 .</p>
<p>As a science guided organization, we take a proactive approach to our environmental sustainability initiatives. In 2022, we announced a new goal to further reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve the Science Based Target Initiative's voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040. As part of this goal, Pfizer aims to decrease its GHG emissions by 95% and its value chain emissions by 90% from 2019 levels by 2040. To support our goal, we are developing and implementing our emission reduction plan, which will include strategies to achieve reductions throughout our value chain including investing in new technologies and innovative climate solutions, and setting expectations for our suppliers to establish sciencealigned GHG emission reduction goals. Our emission reduction plan-related expenses and capital spending incurred for 2023 were not</p>

<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>material to our consolidated financial statements. While we expect to incur incremental capital and operational expenditures to meet our goal, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our financial position in the near term. Longer term uncertainties such as the likelihood of commercially available technologies make it difficult to predict the financial impact of meeting the goal, and we will continue to assess and monitor the financial impact of the emission reduction plan.</p>
<p>For a discussion of the risks associated with climate change and our environmental initiatives, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Climate Change and Sustainability section.</p>
<h2>OUR PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Our purpose is: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives . These breakthroughs are delivered through the collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2023, including Seagen colleagues, we employed approximately 88,000 people worldwide, with approximately 35,000 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 52% of our global workforce, and approximately 39% of our U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest talent, but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose. At Pfizer, prioritizing a positive colleague experience is of utmost importance, particularly during times of business transformation. We were conscious of the impact that the challenges and opportunities facing our business throughout the year had on colleagues. Our goal is to prioritize the health and wellness of our colleagues, creating an environment where colleagues can excel in their work and advance our purpose. To achieve this, we strive to cultivate an inclusive and empowering work environment. This involves simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary complexity, recognizing both performance and leadership skills, fostering career growth and internal mobility, and providing competitive compensation and benefits programs that promote mental and physical well-being.</p>
<p>Core Values. To fully realize Pfizer's purpose we have established a clear set of goals regarding what we need to achieve for patients and how we will go about achieving them. The "how" is represented by four simple, powerful company core values Courage , Excellence , Equity and Joy .</p>
<p>Each value defines our company and our culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Courage : Breakthroughs start by challenging convention - especially in the face of uncertainty or adversity. This happens when we think big, speak up and are decisive.</li>
<li>· Excellence : We can only change patients' lives when we perform at our best together. This happens when we focus on what matters, agree who does what and measure outcomes.</li>
<li>· Equity : Every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for. This happens when we are inclusive, act with integrity and reduce healthcare disparities.</li>
<li>· Joy : We give ourselves to our work, and it also gives to us. We find joy when we take pride, recognize one another and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. At Pfizer, every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for. We embed diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace and our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. As we work to bring together people with different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences we take specific actions to help foster an inclusive environment within Pfizer and beyond, including, among others: (i) building a more inclusive colleague experience through representation and meaningful connections; (ii) advancing equitable health outcomes by evaluating our work through the lens of the communities we serve, (iii) providing resources on allyship and the science behind inclusion to support all colleagues in having courageous conversations about equity, race and the avoidance of bias; (iv) working to help transform society with external diversity, equity and inclusion partnerships, including deploying capital, engaging diverse suppliers and amplifying equity initiatives; and (v) working to help ensure demographics of clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place.</p>
<p>Colleague Engagement . To attract, develop and inspire the brightest talent, we aim to support our colleagues by engaging and partnering with them to help ensure they feel they are part of a community. We understand that continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback is essential to fostering a healthy work environment particularly during times of change and uncertainty. We are passionate about creating safe spaces at work so our employees feel able and encouraged to provide the company with feedback. The Office of the Ombuds is a resource where all Pfizer colleagues at any level can come to get information and guidance to help them address and resolve work-related issues. We also host company-wide safe space calls and provide various other public, private and anonymous channels for employees to share feedback without fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, provides a forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their colleague experience. Through this survey, we measure and track priority areas of the overall colleague experience and equip leaders with actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include: (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues' commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer; (ii) purpose, including how colleagues' work connects with our purpose; (iii) inclusion, such as having a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued; (iv) empowerment, such as colleagues feeling empowered and enabled to do their best work together; and (v) growth, including the ability for colleagues to gain new experiences that align with their individual career goals. In addition, we ask for feedback at various points in the employee lifecycle through surveys, focus groups and colleague forums. The information we receive helps enable us to adapt to the real-time needs of our employees and continuously improve our ways of working. While we have already made progress in reducing bureaucracy and streamlining processes, we recognize that there is still room for improvement, particularly in the effectiveness of our cross-functional teams.</p>
<p>Throughout 2023, we have developed and tested a new approach that aims to expedite decision-making, provide clarity in roles and responsibilities, enhance governance, redefine the role of a leader, and ultimately improve overall team productivity and performance. This new way of working signifies our commitment to becoming a more dynamic organization that thrives on collaboration and agility. By revolutionizing the way our teams operate, we believe we can drive better business outcomes and, most importantly, make a meaningful difference in the lives of people around the world.</p>
<p>Pfizer also prioritizes colleague recognition to drive engagement, a sense of belonging, motivation, and productivity. Our global rewards and recognition program, Bravo, lets colleagues celebrate and acknowledge each other for demonstrating Pfizer values in a way that makes an impact on the company, a colleague, a team or a patient. In 2023, 84% of colleagues were recognized, and more than 650,000 recognitions were given.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Performance and Leadership. We understand the significance of leadership and its crucial role in promoting growth and delivering breakthrough results. We believe that each of our colleagues has the potential to lead in a unique way and create a meaningful impact on a global scale. To support this belief, we have developed a new leadership profile for our colleagues that aligns with our company values of courage, excellence, equity and joy.</p>
<p>We believe this renewed focus on leadership applies to all colleagues, which may help us to foster transformational thinking and executional excellence. By pursuing these leadership qualities, we believe Pfizer can help ensure that its leaders and colleagues are aligned with the company's values, behaviors and purpose, which may help lead to better outcomes and a positive impact on the lives they touch.</p>
<p>We are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providing opportunities for growth and development. Our performance management approach-called Performance and Leadership Insights-is based on six-month semesters during which our colleagues and their managers set goals, receive feedback and meet to discuss performance. These conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating performance (what the colleague achieved, measured by outcomes), leadership (how they achieved it, taking into account Pfizer's values of courage, excellence, equity and joy), and identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential.</p>
<p>Growth and Development . By prioritizing the ongoing development of our employees, we not only support their individual success but also cultivate a resilient and adaptable workforce that can thrive in the face of change. As we navigate the evolving landscape of our industry, we recognize that providing our employees with opportunities for learning, skill-building and growth is essential to their engagement, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. In 2023, we continued to maintain low voluntary turnover rates relative to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Our view of career growth is built on aspirations and empowers individuals to boldly own their growth journey. We deepened our efforts to redefine growth as a fluid process that promotes incremental in-role growth or mobility along horizontal, vertical or diagonal individualized pathways-what we are calling "zig-zag" growth. Our commitments to colleague development consist of specific actions to encourage non-linear "zig-zag" career growth paths for all colleagues, including (i) a common language around growth-along with a guiding framework-to help colleagues identify their next best growth experience, (ii) tools and resources to encourage growth conversations and offer transparency on the sources of growth available, and (iii) a variety of opportunities to grow through experiences, connections with others and learning programs, including mentoring, job rotations, experiential projects, skillbased volunteering and personalized learning pathways that address a variety of topics, including leadership and management skills and industry- and job-specific learning, as well as general business, manufacturing, finance and technology skills.</p>
<p>Health, Safety and Well-Being . Protecting the health, safety and well-being of colleagues and contingent workers, all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives, is an integral part of how we operate. Our Global Environment, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) Policy and supporting standards outline our approach to assessment, evaluation, elimination, and mitigation of EHS risks across our operations globally. We are committed to supporting and encouraging our colleagues' well-being and use results from Pfizer Pulse and other employee feedback forums to inform the wellness services we offer, such as (i) a Wellness Day for every colleague, (ii) on-site health clinics for colleagues in select locations, with access to certain vaccinations, where allowed by law, (iii) digital accessibility cafés that provide employees with disabilities the tools and equipment to do their jobs effectively, (iv) mental health resources, including a manager/team toolkit designed to facilitate conversations, actively care for coworkers, and provide local resources for employees to access support, (v) programming through Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providers, including our mental health partner THRIVE, our fitness partner Exos, and healthcare partner Kepro, (vi) financial support, including short-term loans and natural disaster relief, and (vii) flexible work policies enabling employees to work from home and their local offices.</p>
<p>Pay Equity. Our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is based in our value of Equity and our intention to continue to build a diverse, inclusive and highly motivated workforce. We are committed to equitable pay practices at Pfizer for employees based on role, education, experience, performance, and location and we conduct and report publicly on pay equity on an annual basis.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>This section describes the material risks to our business, which should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Additionally, our business is subject to general risks applicable to any company, such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, extreme weather and natural disasters. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, our business operations, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings could be adversely affected now and in the future, potentially in a material way. The following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements, as discussed in the Forward-Looking Information and Factors that May Affect Future Results section.</p>
<h2>RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS:</h2>
<h2>MANAGED CARE TRENDS</h2>
<p>Private payors, such as health plans, and other managed care entities, such as PBMs, continue to take action to manage the utilization and costs of drugs in the U.S., the single largest market for biopharmaceutical products. The negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payors has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with state and federal governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of deductibles, utilization management tools, cost sharing or formulary placement. They may demand rebates from biopharmaceutical manufacturers for preferred placement on a drug formulary. The growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicines that treat rare or life threatening conditions, typically with a relatively higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, also has generated increased payor interest in development of cost-containment strategies. These initiatives have increased consumers' interest in drug prices and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing net of rebates.</p>
<p>Third-party payors also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts and cost efficiency. Such payors are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more other products before permitting access to a particular branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payor market consolidates further, and as the IRA prices become publicly available, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost alternatives</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>or seek even larger rebates to control costs or offset losses from the IRA. For additional information on the IRA, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.</p>
<p>Also, business arrangements in this area are subject to a high degree of government scrutiny, and available safe harbors under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, as well as evolving judicial interpretations. Our approach to these arrangements may also be informed by such government and industry guidance.</p>
<h2>COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>Competitive product launches have and may erode future sales of our products, including our existing products and those currently under development, or result in product obsolescence. Such launches continue to occur, and potentially competitive products are in various stages of development. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat or prevent diseases and conditions like those treated or prevented by our in-line products and product candidates.</p>
<p>Some of our competitors may have competitive, technical or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. Our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, exclusionary contracting, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could negatively impact our results of operations.</p>
<p>In addition, competition from manufacturers of generic drugs, including from generic versions of competitors' branded products that lose their market exclusivity, is a major challenge for our branded products. Certain of our products have experienced significant generic competition over the last few years. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. See the Item 1. Business-Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section. In China, we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturers, which has resulted, and may result in the future, in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products.</p>
<p>In addition, our patented products may face generic or biosimilar competition before patent exclusivity expires, including from "at-risk" launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic or biosimilar product) by a manufacturer of a generic or biosimilar version of one of our patented products. Generic and biosimilar manufacturers have filed or could file applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that they claim do not infringe our or our collaboration and licensing partners' patents or claim that our or our collaboration and licensing partners' patents are not valid. We and our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges in various jurisdictions by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering products for which we have patent rights, licenses or co-promotion rights. See Note 16A1 .</p>
<p>We may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic products if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars.</p>
<p>We also commercialize biosimilar products that compete with products of others, including other biosimilar products. The entry to the market of competing biosimilars is expected to increase pricing pressures on our biosimilar products. Uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factors, such as anti-competitive practices, access challenges where our product may not receive appropriate coverage/reimbursement access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product, physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patients taking the reference product, or misaligned financial incentives for certain prescribers.</p>
<p>For additional information on competition our products face, see the Item 1. Business -Competition section.</p>
<h2>CONCENTRATION</h2>
<p>We recorded direct product and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products that collectively accounted for 64% of Total revenues in 2023. In particular, Comirnaty accounted for 19% of Total revenues in 2023. See Notes 1 and 17 . If these products or any of our other major products were to, or continue to (if applicable), experience loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription or vaccination purchasing or growth rates, reduced product demand, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, regulatory proceedings or investigations, lower governmental and/or regulatory confidence, negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures or supply shortages or if a new, more effective product should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant and our revenue forecasts and expectations could prove to be inaccurate and we may fail to meet these expectations. In particular, certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. In addition, patents covering a number of our best-selling products are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For additional information on our patents, see the Item 1. Business -Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section. For Comirnaty and Paxlovid, while we believe that these products have the potential to provide ongoing revenue streams for Pfizer for the foreseeable future, revenues of these products following the COVID-19 pandemic have decreased substantially, and our current expectations for total COVID-19 product revenues in 2024 are lower than the total 2023 revenues from COVID-19 products. For information on risks associated with Comirnaty and Paxlovid, see the COVID-19 section below.</p>
<p>In addition, certain of our customers account for a significant portion of our revenues. If one of our significant customers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business such customer does with us and/or we might be unable to timely collect all the amounts that such customer owes us or at all, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. See Note 17C for a discussion of our significant customers.</p>
<h2>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>The discovery and development of new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth, primarily through internal R&amp;D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. Growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop</p>

<p>17</p>
<p>new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payors. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high and are growing, as are regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas, which may affect the complexity of drug trials, and the number of candidates we are able to fund as well as the sustainability of the R&amp;D portfolio. Decisions made early in the development process of a drug or vaccine candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payor reimbursement possibilities if the candidate receives regulatory approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenges, but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed and desired outcome will be achieved.</p>
<p>Additionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&amp;D process, and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&amp;D. We may fail to correctly identify compounds or indications for which our science is promising or allocate R&amp;D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if we identify areas with the greatest commercial potential, the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for R&amp;D, and the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic regulatory and market environments and the hurdles in terms of access, coverage and reimbursement. For example, certain of our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology with only a handful of gene therapies approved to date, which make it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and the ability to obtain regulatory approval.</p>
<h2>GLOBAL OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>We operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency and interest rate fluctuations; capital and exchange controls; local and global economic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity in capital markets; expropriation and other restrictive government actions; changes in intellectual property; legal protections and remedies; trade regulations; tax laws and regulations; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and their economic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change.</p>
<p>Some emerging market countries may be particularly vulnerable to periods of financial, economic or political instability or significant currency fluctuations or may have limited resources for healthcare spending. As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and any growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable. Additionally, local economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of payors, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us.</p>
<p>Government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through health technology assessments) or other means of cost control. For additional information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business-Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.</p>
<p>We continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts and impediments that could impact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity, potential impacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investments; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased government cost control efforts; delays or failures in the performance of customers, suppliers and other third parties on whom we may depend for the performance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate.</p>
<p>We operate in many countries and transact in many different currencies. Changes in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, or high inflation or deflation in those countries, can impact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to exchange rate changes. 54% of our total 2023 revenues were derived from international operations, including 24% from Europe and 20% from Japan, China and the rest of the Asia Pacific region. Future changes in exchange rates or economic conditions and the impact they may have on our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. For additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligations and interest-bearing investments are subject to risk from changes in interest and exchange rates. The risks related to interest-bearing investments and borrowings and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A and Note 7E . For additional details on critical accounting estimates and assumptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions-Benefit Plans section within MD&amp;A and Note 11 .</p>
<h2>PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALES AND MARKETING RISKS</h2>
<p>We could encounter difficulties, delays or inefficiencies in our supply chain, product manufacturing and distribution networks, as well as sales or marketing, due to regulatory actions, shut-downs, work stoppages or strikes, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities or third-party facilities that we rely on, reputational harm, the impact to our facilities due to health pandemics or natural or man-made disasters, including as a result of climate change, product liability or unanticipated costs. Examples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase or maintain production capacity commensurate with demand; challenges related to component materials to maintain supply and/or appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or comply with applicable regulations; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls; and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor. In addition, we engage contract manufacturers, and, from time to time, our contract manufacturers may face difficulties or are unable to manufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels.</p>
<p>Regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate compliance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarment, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denials of import certifications.</p>
<p>In 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. have issued updated guidance on nitrosamine acceptable intake levels. With this recently issued guidance, which included an updated intake level for Nnitroso-varenicline, we expect to make regulatory submissions in 2024 to potentially enable Chantix to return to market outside the U.S., and our related discussions with FDA are ongoing.</p>

<p>Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. While manufacturing has resumed, the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through 2024. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Operating Environment section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<h2>COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<p>We depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into JVs and other business development transactions. To achieve expected longer-term benefits, we may make substantial upfront payments as part of these transactions, which may negatively impact our earnings or cash flows. We rely heavily on these parties for multiple aspects of our drug development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control many aspects of those activities. We also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, IT, manufacturing, clinical trial recruitment and execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities management and other areas. Failure by one or more of the third-party collaborators, service providers and others to complete activities on schedule or in accordance with our expectations or to meet their contractual or other obligations to us; failure of one or more of these parties to comply with applicable laws or regulations; disruptions in one or more of these parties' businesses, including unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or components, cyber-attacks on supplier systems, labor disputes or shortage and inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters or pandemics; or any disruption in the relationships between us and these parties have or could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our products and product candidates, expose us to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverables, result in repercussions such as missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, erroneous data and supply disruptions, and could also result in non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements or industry standards or subject us to reputational harm, all with potential negative implications for our product pipeline and business. Further, our Alliance revenues will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co-promotion agreements that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time.</p>
<h2>COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>Our reputation, in-line and pipeline portfolios render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters. Counterfeits pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected, and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact Pfizer's patients, potentially causing them harm. This situation, in turn, may result in the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines and vaccines, and potentially impact our business through lost sales, product recalls, and possible litigation.</p>
<p>The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce. The increased adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed consumers to fake prescription treatments via the internet as access to traditional brick and mortar pharmacies or authorized full-service internet pharmacies that offer authentic treatments may have been hindered . The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams that target unsuspecting consumers. Traffic to these generally deceptive pharmacy sites is largely driven by misplaced trust in sophisticated internet retailers and social media offers coupled with the convenience e-commerce affords consumers. Counterfeiters generally target any medicine or vaccine boasting strong demand and we have observed heightened counterfeit and fraud attempts to our internal medicine portfolio, as well as products utilized in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We consistently invest in an enterprise-wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threats by educating patients and healthcare providers about the risks, investing in innovative technologies to detect and disrupt sophisticated internet offers and scams, proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement, and advising legislators and regulators. However, our efforts and those of others may not be entirely successful, and the presence of counterfeit medicines may continue to increase.</p>
<h2>RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:</h2>
<h2>PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT</h2>
<p>U.S. and international governmental regulations that mandate price controls or limitations on patient access to our products, create coverage criteria or establish prices paid by government entities or programs for our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. In addition to the recent expansion of price controls in the U.S. in the IRA, the adoption of restrictive coverage policies and price controls in new jurisdictions, more restrictive controls in existing jurisdictions or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate coverage and pricing could also adversely impact revenue. We expect pricing pressures and other cost containment measures for drugs and vaccines will continue globally.</p>
<p>In the U.S., pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and calls for reform, and many of our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures as a result. We expect to see continued focus by the U.S. Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing and access to medicine. For example, in August 2022, the drug pricing provisions of the IRA were signed into law, which, among other things, require manufacturers of certain drugs, including Pfizer, to engage in price negotiations with Medicare which will permit the CMS to set a maximum fair price for selected drugs, impose rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and replace the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA began to be implemented in 2022 and implementation efforts are expected to continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first round of medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Pricing Negotiation Program, which included Eliquis. CMS will establish a maximum fair price for Eliquis that will be in effect in 2026. That maximum fair price will be required to be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340B Program if lower than the 340B price. Health plans may also require rebates in addition to the maximum fair price for preferred placement on a Medicare plan formulary. The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore, the outcome of the 340B Program remains uncertain. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations, financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Payors may promote generic drugs and biosimilars more aggressively to generate savings and attempt to stimulate additional price competition. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. Some states have implemented, and others are considering, patient access constraints or cost cutting under state regulated programs including the Medicaid program. State legislatures also have continued to focus on addressing drug costs, generally by increasing price transparency or attempting to limit drug price increases for state regulated insurance. Measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>products, including legislation on drug importation, such as Florida's drug importation program which was recently approved by the FDA, could adversely affect our business. For additional information on U.S. pricing and reimbursement, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.</p>
<p>We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we operate. In certain markets, such as in EU member states, the U.K., Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, governments have significant power as large single payors to regulate prices, access criteria, or impose other means of cost control, particularly as a result of recent global financing pressures. For example, the QCE and VBP tender process in China has resulted in significant price cuts for off-patent medicines. Additionally, in the EU, the EC proposed the largest reform to drug pricing and access in 20 years, which if enacted would change regulatory exclusivity for our products. For additional information regarding these government initiatives, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints section. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In addition, in many countries, with respect to our vaccines, we participate in a tender process for selection in national immunization programs. Failure to secure participation in national immunization programs or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business. Pricing pressures have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, amplified by COVID-19 induced budget deficits and focus on pricing for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.</p>
<h2>U.S. HEALTHCARE REGULATION</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Any significant additional efforts at the U.S. federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. For additional information on U.S. healthcare regulation, see the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.</p>
<p>Other U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action and/or policy efforts could adversely affect our business, including, among others, general budget control actions, changes in patent laws, the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S. at prices that are regulated by foreign governments, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs that could reference international prices or require new discounts, limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals and other industry stakeholders, or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines.</p>
<p>Any additional reduction of U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs beyond the IRA, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services provided using our products. Any other significant spending reductions or cost controls affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The IRA will be implemented largely through government guidance and as its effect on Medicare and commercial markets evolve, we will continue to evaluate the potential impacts to our business.</p>
<p>We expect additional cost containment measures at both the federal and state levels as efforts to reduce drug costs continue. Further, commercial payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations when setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in cost or other containment measures may similarly be adopted by commercial plans. Coverage policies and reimbursement rates for commercial plans may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.</p>
<h2>DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>The discovery and development of drugs, vaccines and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. The outcome is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk due to the following factors, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>· The process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trials to regulatory approval can take many years and have high costs.</li>
<li>· We may have difficulties recruiting and enrolling patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis.</li>
<li>· Product candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, or unfavorable new pre-clinical or clinical data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical or clinical data, including results that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication.</li>
<li>· We may need to amend our clinical trial protocols or conduct additional clinical trials under certain circumstances, for example, to further assess appropriate dosage or collect additional safety data.</li>
<li>· We may not be able to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates.</li>
<li>· We may not be able to successfully address all the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and the EMA, or be able to obtain approval for new products and indications from regulators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulatory approvals of our products depend on myriad factors, including regulatory determinations as to the product's safety and efficacy. In the context of public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators evaluate various factors and criteria to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency or conditional basis. Additionally, clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities. As a result of regulatory interpretations and assessments or other developments that may occur during the review process, or even after a product is authorized or approved for marketing, a product's commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concerns or regulatory decisions regarding or impacting the scope of indicated patient populations, labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety issues and/or other matters, including decisions relating to emerging developments regarding potential product impurities. Also, certain of our products have received and may in the future receive approvals under accelerated approval pathways where continued approval may be contingent upon confirmatory studies demonstrating the anticipated clinical benefit and/or safety profile.</p>
<p>We may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the ACIP or an FDA Advisory Committee, which may impact the availability or commercial potential of our products and product candidates. Further, claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety and/or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates can negatively impact current or future product sales, as applicable, and potentially lead to product recalls or withdrawals, including regulator-directed risk evaluations and assessments, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Regulatory requirements may also result in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to requests for, among other things, additional or more extensive clinical trials prior</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>to granting approval, or increased post-approval requirements. For these and other reasons discussed in this Risk Factors section, we may not obtain the approvals we expect within the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.</p>
<h2>POST-AUTHORIZATION/APPROVAL DATA</h2>
<p>As a condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of a product, the FDA may require, or the sponsor may voluntarily agree to undertake, post-marketing commitments such as additional clinical trials or other studies. The results generated in these trials have in the past impacted certain of our products and could impact our products in the future, such as by resulting in the loss of marketing approval, changes in labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about safety and/or efficacy, including newly discovered adverse events. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have similar regulations and may impose comparable requirements, although there are differences between the U.S., the EU and other international regulatory requirements, which may contribute to inconsistency or uncertainty in the marketability of our products across different jurisdictions. Post-marketing studies and clinical trials, whether conducted by us or by others, whether mandated by regulatory agencies or conducted voluntarily, and other emerging data about products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. Further, if safety or efficacy concerns are raised about a product in the same class as one of our products, those concerns could implicate the entire class; and this, in turn, could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product(s) as well as other products in the class. The potential regulatory and commercial implications of post-marketing study results typically cannot immediately be determined.</p>
<p>The terms of our EUA for Comirnaty require that we conduct post-observational studies to evaluate the association between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Original monovalent), Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (2023-2024 Formula), and a pre-specified list of adverse events of special interest, including myocarditis and pericarditis, along with deaths and hospitalizations, and severe COVID-19. The required study populations include individuals specified in our September 2023 authorization letter (reissued) as well as populations of interest, such as healthcare workers, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals and subpopulations with specific comorbidities. Additionally, in relation to the FDA approval for Comirnaty, we are required to complete certain postmarketing study requirements and commitments through 2024 and beyond. In the FDA's revision to the EUA for Paxlovid, the FDA removed the post-authorization requirements as they were addressed as a post-marketing commitment associated with the approval of the Paxlovid NDA. The terms of our Paxlovid EUA had previously required monitoring of a genomic database(s) for the emergence of global viral variants of SARS-CoV-2 and providing reports to the FDA on a monthly basis summarizing any findings. Also, the FDA required Pfizer to assess the activity of the authorized Paxlovid against any global SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) of interest and complete certain other analyses and studies as identified in our October 2022 EUA.</p>
<h2>LEGAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>We are and may be involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, including personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, commercial and other asserted and unasserted matters, environmental, government and tax investigations, employment, tax litigation and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, we have in the past and could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.</p>
<p>Claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the product at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.</p>
<p>We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There continues to be a significant volume of government investigations and litigation against companies operating in our industry, both in the U.S. and around the world. Government investigations and actions have and could result in substantial criminal and civil fines and/or criminal charges, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements and other disciplinary actions, as well as reputational harm, including as a result of increased public interest in the matter. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>Our sales and marketing activities, the pricing of our products and other aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under the FFDCA, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the FCPA and other federal and state statutes, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as the Anti-Kickback Statute, anti-bribery laws, the False Claims Act, and similar laws in international jurisdictions. In addition to the potential for changes to relevant laws, the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation, settlement precedent, advisory opinions, and special fraud alerts. Our approach to certain practices may evolve over time in light of these types of developments.</p>
<p>Requirements or industry standards in the U.S. and certain jurisdictions abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and disclose financial interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare providers and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interactions. If an interaction is found to be improper, government enforcement actions and penalties could result. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time-to-time received, and may receive in the future, inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities. In addition, we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities, brought by governmental authorities, as well as consumers and private payors. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. Such claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product (approved and unapproved) information, potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage. This risk may be heightened by digital marketing, including social media, mobile applications and blogger outreach.</p>
<p>In connection with the resolution of a U.S. government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, in 2018, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (OIG), which expired in May 2023. Pfizer submitted its final annual report and is awaiting a response from the OIG.</p>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claims and proceedings, including environmental contingencies. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. While we have accrued for</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>worldwide legal liabilities, no guarantee exists that additional costs will not be incurred or additional payments will not be required beyond the amounts accrued.</p>
<p>For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved in, see Note 16A .</p>
<h2>RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY:</h2>
<h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION</h2>
<p>Our success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and any term adjustments related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent may be reduced or eliminated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent terms. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.</p>
<p>Further, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products. The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 response. This includes the June 2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to make it easier for certain WTO members to issue a compulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics.</p>
<p>The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies, such as "at-risk" launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a competitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.</p>
<p>We currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.</p>
<h2>THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS</h2>
<p>A properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.</p>
<p>Part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a "first-to-market" or early market position for our products.</p>
<p>Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages or potential licensing agreements. For example, our R&amp;D in a therapeutic area may not be first and another company or entity may have obtained relevant patents before us. We are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attempts to market pharmaceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, Comirnaty and Paxlovid. As we expand our mRNA portfolio, patent-related disputes may increase. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., "at-risk" launch). If one of our marketed products (or a product of our</p>

<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.</p>
<h2>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY</h2>
<p>Significant disruptions of IT systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We extensively rely upon sophisticated IT systems (including cloud services) to operate our business. We produce, collect, process, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such confidential information. We develop and operate digital systems to engage patients, healthcare providers, governments, payors and supply chain partners to conduct business and deliver medicines, digital diagnostics, clinical trials and digital therapies. Such systems include mobile applications, wearable devices, internet websites and other digital technologies that may be targets of attack. We have outsourced significant elements of our operations, including significant elements of our IT infrastructure and, as a result, we manage relationships with many third-party providers who may or could have access to our confidential information. We rely on technology developed, supplied and/or maintained by third-parties that may make us vulnerable to "supply chain" style cyber-attacks. Further, technology and security vulnerabilities of acquisitions, business partners or third-party providers may not be identified during due diligence or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. The size and complexity of our IT and information security systems, and those of our third-party providers (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by, but not limited to, our employees, contingent workers, service providers, business partners, customers or malicious attackers. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems and assets are the target of frequent cyber-attacks. Such cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, including the use of adversarial artificial intelligence techniques, and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage, extortion, property destruction and personal information theft) and expertise, including, but not limited to, organized criminal groups, "hacktivists," nation states, employees, business partners and others. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and IT and develop and maintain systems and controls, our efforts, like those of other similar companies, have not always and may not in the future prevent service interruptions, extortion, theft of confidential, personal or proprietary information, compromise of data integrity or unauthorized information disclosure. Any technology service interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of personal data, confidential information or intellectual property. Such incidents could require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators and could require notification to impacted individuals and any incident could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence-based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical and global healthcare industries. As with many developing technologies, artificial intelligencebased software presents risks and challenges. For example, algorithms may be flawed; data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information; and inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users could impair results. If the analyses that artificial intelligence-based applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. Furthermore, use of artificial intelligence-based software may lead to the release of confidential information which may impact our ability to realize the benefits of our intellectual property.</p>
<h2>GENERAL RISKS</h2>
<h2>BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIC GOALS</h2>
<p>We have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by not only advancing our own product pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of Seagen is part of that growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. The success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes or at all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which has in the past and could in the future result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings and could limit our ability to obtain future financing. We have incurred substantial indebtedness to fund our recent acquisition of Seagen. We financed a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, plus $8 billion in additional short-term indebtedness issued prior to the acquisition. The amount of debt that we have incurred could have significant consequences including, among other things, reducing our operating or financial flexibility, requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further.</p>
<p>The success of our business development transactions, including our recent acquisition of Seagen, depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges, among other factors, may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from business development transactions, including from acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products, product pipeline and contribution from these transactions or from acquired products or businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings, such as those expected with respect to Seagen, within expected time frames or at all, which may impact our ability to meet our growth objectives. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time, which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from certain transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of acquired products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Where we invest in or otherwise obtain debt or equity securities of third parties in connection with business development transactions, such as our ownership interest in Haleon, we may be unable to direct or influence the management, operational decisions and policies of such companies and the value of the acquired securities will fluctuate and may lose value. Any future distribution or sale of such securities will be subject to prevailing market conditions and other factors, including the size of our ownership stake, at the time of such distribution or sale and there is no assurance as to the price that such securities will ultimately be sold or that such securities will be sold at all.</p>
<h2>PANDEMICS</h2>
<p>Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted and may in the future impact our business, operations and financial condition and results. Related risks and challenges for our business include, among others: uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of a pandemic; impacts to business operations; decreased demand for certain of our products; increased costs of doing business; manufacturing disruptions and delays; supply chain disruptions and shortages, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development, manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products; evolving macroeconomic factors and conditions, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures; changes in labor markets, including challenges related to our human capital and talent development; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to any potential pandemic response; increased difficulty and uncertainty regarding predicting or estimating future performance; pace of post-pandemic recovery, disruption and volatility within the financial or credit markets; and our financial performance in general.</p>
<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business going forward will depend on many factors, and we have made certain assumptions regarding COVID-19 for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the global macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, as well as the demand, revenues, supply, contracts, market share and commercial markets for our current or future COVID-19 products, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of COVID-19 or our COVID-19 products on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. COVID19 or our COVID-19 products may also affect our business, operations or financial condition and results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks.</p>
<p>We also face risks and uncertainties related to our efforts to develop and commercialize our COVID-19 products, as well as challenges related to their manufacturing, supply and distribution, including, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the risk that as the market for COVID-19 products becomes more endemic and seasonal, demand for any of our COVID-19 products has and may continue to be reduced or not meet expectations, or may no longer exist, which has and may continue to lead to reduced revenues, excess inventory on-hand and/or in the channel which, for Paxlovid and Comirnaty, has resulted in significant inventory write-offs in 2023 and could continue to result in inventory write-offs or other unanticipated charges;</li>
<li>· challenges related to the transition to the commercial market for our COVID-19 products;</li>
<li>· uncertainties related to the public's demand for vaccines, boosters and COVID-19 treatments;</li>
<li>· risks related to our ability to accurately forecast and achieve our revenue forecasts for Comirnaty and Paxlovid or any potential future COVID-19 vaccines or treatments;</li>
<li>· uncertainties inherent in R&amp;D, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with pre-clinical and clinical data (including Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data for Comirnaty or any vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program or Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment) in any of our studies in pediatrics, adolescents or adults or real world evidence, including the possibility of unfavorable new pre-clinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing pre-clinical, clinical or safety data or further information regarding the quality of preclinical, clinical or safety data, including by audit or inspection;</li>
<li>· the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results for Comirnaty, any vaccine candidate or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment or any other COVID-19 program, including the rate of effectiveness and/or efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial for any such products and additional studies, in real-world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization;</li>
<li>· the ability of Comirnaty or any future vaccine to prevent, or Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment to be effective against, COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants;</li>
<li>· the risk that use of Comirnaty or Paxlovid will lead to new information about efficacy, safety or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious;</li>
<li>· the risk that pre-clinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities;</li>
<li>· whether and when additional data from the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or other COVID-19 programs will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations;</li>
<li>· whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from existing or future pre-clinical and clinical studies;</li>
<li>· whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Comirnaty or any future vaccines in additional populations, for a potential booster dose for Comirnaty, or any potential future vaccine or vaccine candidates (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or biologics license and/or EUA applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for Comirnaty or any other potential vaccine or vaccine candidates, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses, or existing EUAs, will expire or terminate;</li>
<li>· whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment and/or any drug applications and/or EUA applications or amendments to any such applications for any indication for Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment may be filed in particular jurisdictions, and if obtained, whether or when such EUA or licenses, or existing EUAs, will expire or terminate;</li>
<li>· whether and when any application that may be pending or filed for Comirnaty, any vaccine candidate or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program, Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 treatment or any other COVID-19 program may be approved by particular regulatory</li>

<p>authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine's or drug's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine's or drug's efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful;</p>
<ul>
<li>· decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any vaccine or drug, including the authorization or approval of products or therapies developed by other companies;</li>
<li>· disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers, including our relationship with BioNTech;</li>
<li>· the risk that other companies may produce competitive products that may be superior in terms of efficacy, safety, affordability, convenience, or a number of other competitive factors;</li>
<li>· risks related to the availability or cost of raw materials to manufacture or test any such products;</li>
<li>· challenges related to our vaccine's formulation and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by us;</li>
<li>· challenges and risks related to medication errors such as prescribing or dispensing the wrong strength, improper dosing and self-administration errors;</li>
<li>· the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future vaccines, potential combination respiratory vaccines or next generation COVID-19 treatments;</li>
<li>· the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&amp;D and manufacturing efforts;</li>

<li>· challenges and risks associated with the pace of our development programs;</li>
<li>· the risk that we may not be able to maintain manufacturing capacity or access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our COVID-19 products, which would negatively impact our ability to supply our COVID-19 products within the projected time periods;</li>
<li>· whether and when additional supply or purchase agreements will be reached or existing agreements will be modified;</li>
<li>· uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine or treatment advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations;</li>
<li>· pricing and access challenges for such products;</li>
<li>· challenges related to public confidence in, or awareness of Comirnaty, Paxlovid or any future COVID-19 product candidates, including challenges driven by misinformation or disinformation, access, concerns about clinical data integrity, or prescriber and pharmacy education;</li>
<li>· trade restrictions; and</li>
<li>· the risk that we may owe third-party royalties or other adverse outcomes from existing litigation related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid, or have additional other claims asserted related to Comirnaty or Paxlovid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain of these risks and uncertainties also apply to our COVID-19 and influenza diagnostic tests.</p>
<h2>CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
<p>Pfizer is subject to transitional and physical risks related to climate change. Transitional risks include, for example, a disorderly global transition away from fossil fuels that may result in increased energy prices; customer preference for low or no-carbon products; stakeholder pressure to decarbonize assets; or new legal or regulatory requirements that result in new or expanded carbon pricing, taxes, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, and increased greenhouse gas disclosure and transparency. These risks could increase operating costs, including the cost of our electricity and energy use, or otherwise increase compliance costs. Physical risks to our operations include water stress and drought; flooding and storm surge; wildfires; extreme temperatures and storms, which could impact pharmaceutical production, increase costs, or disrupt supply chains of medicines for patients. For example, our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. While manufacturing has resumed, the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through 2024. For additional details on the impact of the tornado in Rocky Mount, NC, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Operating Environment section within MD&amp;A. Our supply chain is subject to these same transitional and physical risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us.</p>
<p>In June 2022, Pfizer established our fourth consecutive greenhouse gas reduction goal with new near- and long-term targets to achieve the Science Based Target Initiative's voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040. While we are working to develop and implement emission reduction plans to achieve our voluntary climate goals, various factors, including the long time horizons and commercial availability of new technologies to enable the emission reductions, in the time and scale needed, may present inherent risk in our ability to meet these goals. Additionally, success may depend on the actions of governments and third parties and may require, among other things, significant capital investment; R&amp;D and government policies and incentives to foster innovation and reduce costs of technologies that may not currently exist or be available at scale.</p>
<p>Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to ESG matters, such as equitable access to medicines and vaccines, product quality and safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, value chain environmental and social due diligence, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human capital factors in our operations. In addition, governments and the public expect companies like us to report on our business practices with respect to human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental impact, as well as the actions of our third-party contractors and suppliers around the world. This focus on ESG matters may lead to new expectations or requirements that could result in increased costs associated with research, development, manufacture, or distribution of our products. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for companies to establish validated Net Zero targets or offer more sustainable products. While we strive to improve our ESG performance and meet our voluntary goals, if we do not meet, or are perceived not to meet, our goals or other stakeholder expectations in key ESG areas, we risk negative stakeholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our brand and reputation, reduced demand for our products or other negative impacts on our business and operations. While we monitor a broad range of ESG matters, we cannot be certain that we will manage such matters successfully, or that we will successfully meet the expectations of investors, employees, consumers, governments and other stakeholders.</p>

<h2>MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS</h2>
<p>Changes in the fair value of certain equity investments that are recognized in net income may result in increased volatility of our income. See Note 4 and the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>Our pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations are subject to volatility from changes in the fair value of equity investments and other investment risk in the assets funding these plans, as well as changes in the appropriate discount rate. See the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions -Benefit Plans section within MD&amp;A and Note 11 .</p>
<h2>COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL AND NONORDINARY EVENTS</h2>
<p>Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product and geographic mix and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product withdrawals, recalls and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could adversely affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, including our enterprise-wide cost realignment program, other corporate strategic initiatives and any acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, as well as potential disruption of ongoing business, such as potential impacts on our ability to deliver on our pipeline as planned. Additionally, as a result of these initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or intellectual property and/or inefficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Reorganizations and restructurings can require a significant amount of time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</p>
<h2>INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS</h2>
<p>Our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&amp;D and goodwill. For IPR&amp;D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, IPR&amp;D assets may become impaired and/or be written off in the future if the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned or is curtailed. See Note 4 for a discussion of recent impairments of IPR&amp;D assets . For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity. Our other intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment. Our equity-method investments may also be subject to impairment charges that may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact our estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from these investments. We may recognize impairment charges as a result of a weak economic environment, events related to particular customers or asset types, challenging market conditions or decisions by management. Any such impairment charge of our intangible assets, goodwill and equitymethod investments may be significant. For additional details, see the S ignificant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions -Asset Impairments section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<h2>CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</h2>
<p>Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations internationally and in the U.S. (including, among other things, the IRA, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, the adoption of global minimum taxation requirements outside the U.S. generally effective in most jurisdictions since January 1, 2024 and potential changes to existing tax law by the current U.S. Presidential administration and Congress, including the proposed "Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024"), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries. For additional information on changes in tax laws or rates or accounting standards, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income and New Accounting Standards sections within MD&amp;A and Note 1B .</p>
<h2>ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY</h2>
<p>Managing cybersecurity risk is a crucial part of our overall strategy for safely operating our business. We incorporate cybersecurity practices into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach, which is subject to oversight by our BOD. Our cybersecurity policies and practices are aligned with relevant industry standards.</p>
<p>Consistent with our overall ERM program and practices, our cybersecurity program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Vigilance : We maintain a global cybersecurity operation that endeavors to detect, prevent, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing business disruptions.</li>
<li>· External Collaboration : We collaborate with public and private entities, including intelligence and law enforcement agencies, industry groups and third-party service providers to identify, assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks.</li>
<li>· Systems Safeguards : We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems, products, operations and sensitive information from cybersecurity threats. These include firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, disaster recovery capabilities, malware and ransomware prevention, access controls and data protection. We continuously conduct vulnerability assessments to identify new risks and periodically test the efficacy of our safeguards through both internal and external penetration tests.</li>
<li>· Education : We provide periodic training for all personnel regarding cybersecurity threats, with such training appropriate to the roles, responsibilities and access of the relevant Company personnel. Our policies require all workers to report any real or suspected cybersecurity events.</li>
<li>· Supplier Ecosystem Management : We extend our cybersecurity management control expectations to our supply chain ecosystem, as applicable. This includes identifying cybersecurity risks presented by third parties.</li>
<li>· Incident Response Planning : We have established, and maintain and periodically test, incident response plans that direct our response to cybersecurity events and incidents. Such plans include the protocol by which material incidents would be communicated to executive management, our BOD, external regulators and shareholders.</li>
<li>· Enterprise-Wide Coordination : We engage experts from across the Company to identify emerging risks and respond to cybersecurity threats. This cross-functional approach includes personnel from our R&amp;D, manufacturing, commercial, technology, legal, compliance, internal audit and other business functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>26</p>
<ul>
<li>· Governance : Our BOD's oversight of cybersecurity risk management is led by the Audit Committee, which oversees our ERM program. Cybersecurity threats, risks and mitigation are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee and such reviews include both internal and independent assessment of risks, controls and effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our risk assessment efforts have indicated that we are a target for theft of intellectual property, financial resources, personal information, and trade secrets from a wide range of actors including nation states, organized crime, malicious insiders and activists. The impacts of attacks, abuse and misuse of Pfizer's systems and information include, without limitation, loss of assets, operational disruption and damage to Pfizer's reputation.</p>
<p>A key element of managing cybersecurity risk is the ongoing assessment and testing of our processes and practices through auditing, assessments, drills and other exercises focused on evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of our risk mitigation. We regularly engage third parties to perform assessments of our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. Certain results of such assessments and reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and the BOD, as appropriate, and we make adjustments to our cybersecurity processes and practices as necessary based on the information provided by the third-party assessments and reviews.</p>
<p>The Audit Committee oversees cybersecurity risk management, including the policies, processes and practices that management implements to prevent, detect and address risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee receives regular briefings on cybersecurity risks and risk management practices, including, for example, recent developments in the external cybersecurity threat landscape, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, technological trends and considerations arising from our supplier ecosystem. The Audit Committee may also promptly receive information regarding any material cybersecurity incident that may occur, including any ongoing updates regarding the same. The Audit Committee periodically discusses our approach to cybersecurity risk management with our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</p>
<p>Our CISO is a member of our management team who is principally responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management program, in partnership with other business leaders across the Company. The CISO works in coordination with other members of the management team, including, among others, the Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer and the General Counsel and their designees. We believe our business leaders have the appropriate expertise, background and depth of experience to manage risks arising from cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Our CISO, along with leaders from our privacy and corporate compliance functions, collaborate to implement a program designed to manage our exposure to cybersecurity risks and to promptly respond to cybersecurity incidents. Prompt response to incidents is delivered by multi-disciplinary teams in accordance with our incident response plan. Through ongoing communications with these teams during incidents, the CISO monitors the triage, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and reports such incidents to executive management, the Audit Committee and other Pfizer colleagues in accordance with our cybersecurity policies and procedures, as is appropriate.</p>
<p>As of the date of this Form 10-K, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition at this time. For further discussion of the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents, see the Item 1A. Risk FactorsInformation Technology and Security section in this Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. PROPERTIES</h2>
<p>We own and lease space globally for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&amp;D, manufacturing and distribution and corporate enabling functions. In many locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. Our global headquarters are located in New York City. We continue to advance our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces that enable collaboration and foster innovation. As of December 31, 2023, we had 284 owned and leased properties (including properties acquired in the Seagen acquisition), amounting to approximately 38 million square feet. The recent Seagen acquisition has increased our real estate portfolio by 14 sites totaling 1 million square feet.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, of the 284 properties, PGS had responsibility for 37 plants around the world, which manufacture products for our commercial divisions, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. The leadership team for PGS is primarily located in New York City. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world.</p>
<p>In general, we believe that our properties, including the principal properties described above, are well-maintained, adequate and suitable for their current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future. See Note 9 for amounts invested in land, buildings and equipment.</p>

<p>References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.</p>
<p>Our Business and Strategy --Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. See the Item 1. Business--About Pfizer section. As a science-driven global biopharmaceutical company, we remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting our marketed brands and deploying capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can help contribute to our long-term revenue and future growth. Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients and continuously evaluate how we can best collaborate with patients, physicians and payors to support and expand patient access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. In addition, we continually seek to expand and broaden our product portfolio offerings through prioritized development of our pipeline and business development opportunities targeted at critical unmet patient needs. As a result, our commercial organizational structure and R&amp;D operations are critical to the successful execution of our business strategy. Our ability to fulfill our purpose, Breakthroughs that change patients' lives , remains a core focus and underscores our commitment to addressing the needs of society to help sustain longterm value creation for all stakeholders. Our 2024 key priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Achieve world-class oncology leadership</li>
<li>· Deliver next wave of pipeline innovation</li>
<li>· Maximize performance of our new products</li>
<li>· Expand margins by realigning our cost base</li>
<li>· Allocate capital to enhance shareholder value</li>
</ul>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>

<p>In 2023, we managed our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma was the only reportable segment. See Note 1A and the Item 1. Business--Commercial Operations section.</p>
<p>In December 2023, we completed our acquisition of Seagen. At the beginning of 2024, we made changes in our commercial organization that went into effect on January 1, 2024 to incorporate Seagen and improve focus, speed and execution. Specifically, within our Biopharma reportable segment we created:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the Pfizer Oncology Division, which brings together U.S. oncology commercial operations from both Pfizer and Seagen and is led by the Chief Oncology Officer, Executive Vice President, who also leads Pfizer's newly combined global oncology R&amp;D operations;</li>
<li>· the Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division, which focuses on the commercialization of non-oncology products in the U.S. and is led by the Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President; and</li>
<li>· the Pfizer International Commercial Division, which focuses on the commercialization of Pfizer's entire product portfolio outside the U.S. and is led by the Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&amp;D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. Beginning in July 2023, in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the acquisition of Seagen on December 14, 2023, we reorganized our R&amp;D platform operations. See Note 17A . In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. See Note 3 . For a description of savings related to these programs, see the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&amp;A .</p>
<p>R&amp;D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&amp;D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the medicines and vaccines that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&amp;D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section for our R&amp;D priorities and strategy.</p>
<p>We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs; and</li>
<li>· advances in both biological science and platform technologies that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Business Development Initiatives --We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy. For a discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2 .</p>
<h2>Our 2023 Performance</h2>
<p>Total Revenues --Total revenues decreased $41.8 billion, or 42%, to $58.5 billion in 2023 from $100.3 billion in 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $40.8 billion, or 41%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by significant declines in revenues from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including a $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal for Paxlovid recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Total revenues increased 7% operationally, reflecting an increase in revenues from Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta; revenues from Abrysvo, primarily driven by the launch of the older adult indication in the U.S.; as well as continued growth from the Vyndaqel family and Eliquis; partially offset by a decline in Ibrance.</p>
<p>The following chart outlines the components of the net change in Total revenues :</p>

<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>While royalty income through December 31, 2023 has been recorded in Other Income/(Deductions)-net , we will begin reporting such royalty income in Total revenues beginning in 2024 and will restate prior periods for consistency with our 2024 presentation. Additionally, we will no longer record royalties from U.S. sales of Bavencio, as we have irrevocably chosen to donate the right to such royalties to the American Association for Cancer Research.</p>
<p>Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income --The decrease in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $33.7 billion, to $1.1 billion in 2023 from $34.7 billion in 2022, was primarily attributable to (i) lower revenues, (ii) higher intangible asset impairment charges, and (iii) increases in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs , Amortization of intangible assets , and Selling, informational and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iv) a decrease in Cost of sales and (v) net gains on equity securities in 2023 versus net losses on equity securities in 2022 .</p>
<p>See the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income section within MD&amp;A and Note 4 . For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&amp;A and Note 5 .</p>
<p>Our Operating Environment --We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections.</p>
<p>Regulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity --Our product lines must be replenished over time to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth, primarily through internal R&amp;D or through collaborations, acquisitions, JVs, licensing or other arrangements. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&amp;D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. Clinical trials are conducted to determine, among other things, whether an investigational drug, vaccine or device is safe and effective for a particular patient population. After a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients, including conducting postmarketing trials, voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulators. Regulatory authorities evaluate potential safety concerns and take any regulatory action deemed necessary and appropriate. Such action(s) may include: updating a product's labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information or, in rare cases, seeking to suspend or remove a product from the market.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights --The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2024 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.</p>
<p>For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1 .</p>
<p>Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payor Group Pressures --The pricing of medicines and vaccines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, vaccines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payors, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payors in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of deductibles, utilization management tools, cost sharing or formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally, as well as private third-party payors in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, "international reference pricing" (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA, which was signed into law in August 2022, began to be implemented in 2022 and implementation efforts will continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first ten medicines subject to the "Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program," which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Among the first ten medicines subject to the Program included Eliquis. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. In addition, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or the 340B Program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B program, could have a material impact on our business. See the Item 1. Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and --Government Regulation and Price Constraints and the Item 1A. Risk Factors --Pricing and Reimbursement sections.</p>
<p>Impact of the July 2023 Tornado in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (NC) --Our manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, NC was damaged by a tornado in July 2023. The facility is a key producer of sterile injectables and is responsible for manufacturing nearly 25 percent of all our sterile injectables-including anesthesia, analgesia, and micronutrients-which is nearly eight percent of all the sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals. While manufacturing has resumed, the supply of medicines impacted by the tornado is expected to be affected through 2024.</p>
<p>In 2023, we recorded $286 million to Cost of sales for inventory losses, overhead costs related to the period in which the facility could not operate, and incremental costs resulting from the tornado damage. Losses incurred in 2023 were partially offset by insurance recoveries received in the fourth quarter of 2023. We may record additional losses and/or costs and/or insurance recoveries in future periods, but we are unable to predict them with certainty at this time.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Product Supply --We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In 2021, Pfizer recalled all lots of Chantix in the U.S. due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. have issued updated guidance on nitrosamine acceptable intake levels. With this recently issued guidance, which included an updated intake level for N-nitroso-varenicline, we expect to make regulatory submissions in 2024 to potentially enable Chantix to return to market outside the U.S., and our related discussions with FDA are ongoing.</p>
<p>Except for the tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in 2023 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels; however, we continue to see heightened demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future impact on our business. We continue to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section.</p>
<p>The Global Economic Environment --In addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency and interest rate fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, local and global economic conditions including inflation, recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity in capital markets, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and their economic consequences, geopolitical instability, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, intergovernmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control. For additional information on risks related to our global operations, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section.</p>
<p>COVID-19 --In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty, including an Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent vaccine. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the Product Developments section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In 2023, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts. In September 2023, Comirnaty transitioned to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S., triggered by the expiration of current contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the introduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets were generally under government contracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to start transitioning to commercial markets in 2024. Due to the commercial market transition as well as the anticipated seasonal nature of COVID vaccination, we expect more than 80% of our 2024 global revenues for Comirnaty to be recorded in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>In 2023, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies. Internationally, for Paxlovid, we are continuing the transition to commercial markets and are expecting most revenue for Paxlovid to be generated through commercial channels in 2024. On October 13, 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets in November 2023, with minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024. See Note 17C .</p>
<p>For information on risks associated with our COVID-19 products, including certain assumptions made for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections and the uncertainty of future developments, as well as COVID-19 intellectual property disputes, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors -COVID-19 , -Intellectual Property Protection and --ThirdParty Intellectual Property Claims sections and Note 16A1 .</p>
<p>Israel/Hamas Conflict --Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the business of our Israeli subsidiary represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets. We are closely monitoring developments in this conflict, including evaluating potential impacts to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East that may impact global operations. At this time, longer term impacts to the Company are uncertain and subject to change.</p>
<p>Russia/Ukraine Conflict --Our local operations have been impacted by the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the business of our Russia and Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and assets, and while we are monitoring the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation continues to evolve and the long-term implications, including the broader economic consequences of the conflict, are difficult to predict at this time. While as of now, we do not anticipate any significant negative impacts on our global operations from this conflict, continued regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential additional sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, any retaliatory measures taken by Russia, neighboring countries or allies of Russia, and actions by our customers or suppliers, including financial institutions, in response to such measures could adversely affect the global macroeconomic environment, our operations, currency exchange rates and financial markets, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations.</p>

Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions ( Note 1D ); Fair Value ( Note 1E ); Revenues ( Note 1G ); Asset Impairments ( Note 1M ); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies ( Note 1Q ); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans ( Note 1R ); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies ( Note 1S ).</p>

<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
<p>We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. To estimate fair value, we utilize an exit price approach from the perspective of a market participant. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see Note 1D . For further detail on the techniques and methodologies that we use to estimate fair value, see Note 1E . Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. We utilize an income approach to estimate the acquisition date fair value of each identifiable intangible asset. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of projected net cash flows, the discount rate, the tax rate, and, for IPR&amp;D assets, the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS). All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below.</p>
<p>We estimate the fair value of acquired inventory, including finished goods and work in process, by determining the estimated selling price when completed, less an estimate of costs to be incurred to complete and sell the inventory, and an estimate of a reasonable profit allowance for those manufacturing and selling efforts. The fair value of inventory is recognized in our results of operations as the inventory is sold. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the estimate of the fair value of inventory include stage of completion, costs to complete, costs to dispose and selling price.</p>
<p>We estimate the fair value of acquired PP&amp;E using a combination of the cost and market approaches. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in these approaches are the values of asset replacement costs, comparable assets and estimated remaining economic lives of the assets.</p>
<p>For the provisional amounts recognized for the Seagen assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, see Note 2A . The estimated values are not yet finalized and are subject to change, which could be significant. We will finalize the amounts recognized as we obtain the information necessary to complete the analyses. We expect to finalize the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.</p>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each individual product. For further information, see the Product Revenue Deductions section within MD&amp;A and Note 1G .</p>
<h2>Asset Impairments</h2>
<p>We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in Note 1M .</p>
<p>Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.</li>
<li>· A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.</li>
<li>· An expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor's product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payors. For IPR&amp;D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identifiable Intangible Assets --We use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, other than goodwill. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with IPR&amp;D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the jurisdictional mix of the projected cash flows.</p>
<p>While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&amp;D assets (approximately $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2023) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.</p>

<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Goodwill --Our goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2023 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time, as the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly higher than their respective net book values.</p>
<p>In our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.</p>
<p>When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.</p>
<p>For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Result s and the Item 1A. Risk Factors sections.</p>
<h2>Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>For a description of our different benefit plans, see Note 11 .</p>
<p>Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.</p>
<p>The following provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on plan assets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end of each year for our U.S. pension plans and our international pension plans : (a)</p>
<p>| | pension plans : (a) | pension plans : (a) | pension plans : (a) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| U.S. Pension Plans | | | |
| Expected annual rate of return on plan assets | 8.0 % | 7.5 % | 6.3 % |
| Actual annual rate of return on plan assets | 10.4 | (22.4) | 9.2 |
| Discount rate used to measure the plan obligations | 5.4 | 5.4 | 2.9 |
| International Pension Plans | | | |
| Expected annual rate of return on plan assets | 5.1 | 4.5 | 3.1 |
| Actual annual rate of return on plan assets | (4.6) | (26.0) | 11.4 |
| Discount rate used to measure the plan obligations | 4.4 | 3.8 | 1.6 |</p>
<p>Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets --The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans.</p>
<p>The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. Differences between the actual rate of return on plan assets and the expected annual rate of return on plan assets are immediately recognized through earnings upon remeasurement.</p>
<p>The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):</p>
<p>| Assumption | Change | Increase in 2024 Net Periodic Benefit Costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expected annual rate of return on plan assets (a) | 50 basis point decline | $84 |</p>
<p>The actual return on plan assets resulted in a net gain on our plan assets of approximately $835 million during 2023 .</p>
<p>Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations --The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our significant international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements. The measurement of plan obligations at the end of the year will affect (i) the actuarial (gains)/losses recognized in our net periodic benefit cost for that year and (ii) the amount of service cost and interest cost reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.</p>

<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>The following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):</p>
<p>| Assumption | Change | Decrease in 2024 Net Periodic Benefit Costs | Increase to 2023 Benefit Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discount rate | 10 basis point decline | $5 | $210 |</p>
<p>The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2023 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $616 million.</p>

<li>Beginning in 2024, we will include royalty income in Total revenues and will restate prior periods for consistency with our 2024 presentation. (a)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2023 v. 2022</h2>
<h2>Cost of Sales</h2>
<p>Cost of sales decreased $9.4 billion, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a reduction of $14.2 billion due to lower sales of Comirnaty; and</li>
<li>· a reduction of $1.5 billion due to lower sales of Paxlovid,</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· non-cash charges of $6.2 billion for inventory write-offs and related charges ($5.0 billion for Paxlovid and $1.2 billion for Comirnaty).</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in Cost of sales as a percentage of Total revenues was mainly driven by the non-cash charge of $6.2 billion discussed above, and unfavorable changes in sales mix, primarily due to lower sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty, which includes the unfavorable impact of the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal.</p>
<h2>Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative expenses increased $1.1 billion, mostly due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an increase of $1.1 billion in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired and launched products;</li>
<li>· an increase of $280 million for the expected Paxlovid commercial launch;</li>
<li>· an increase of $210 million in our liability to be paid to participants of our supplemental savings plan; and</li>
<li>· an increase of $170 million in marketing and promotional expenses for rare disease products,</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· a decrease of $690 million due to a lower provision for U.S. healthcare reform fees related to Comirnaty and Paxlovid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Research and development expenses decreased $749 million, primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· lower spending of $870 million mainly for lower compensation-related expenses, and ongoing vaccine and hospital programs, as well as</li>
<li>· a decrease of $260 million in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting the decrease in the price of Pfizer's common stock,</li>
</ul>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>39</p>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· increased investments of $345 million, mainly to develop certain acquired assets, as well as activities to support upcoming product launches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Acquired in-process research and development expenses decreased $758 million primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· an upfront payment of $426 million related to the closing of the acquisition of ReViral Ltd. in 2022;</li>
<li>· an upfront payment to Biohaven and a premium paid on our equity investment in Biohaven totaling $263 million in 2022; and</li>
<li>· a $76 million premium paid on our equity investment in BioNTech to develop a potential mRNA vaccine against shingles, both recorded in 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>See Notes 2A and 2E .</p>
<h2>Amortization of Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of 2023 reflecting a full year of amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT, higher amortization of intangible assets related to Prevnar, as well as reclassifications of IPR&amp;D to developed technology rights, partially offset by fully amortized assets. See Notes 2A and 10A .</p>
<h2>Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<p>Transforming to a More Focused Company Program --In connection with restructuring our corporate enabling functions, we achieved gross cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, in the two year period from 2021 through 2022. In connection with transforming our commercial go-to market strategy, we expect net cost savings of $1.4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2022 through 2024. In connection with manufacturing network optimization, we achieved net cost savings of $550 million. In connection with optimizing our end-to-end R&amp;D operations, we expect net cost savings of $2.3 billion to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2025.</p>
<p>Realigning our Cost Base Program --This program is expected to deliver net cost savings of at least $4 billion, to be achieved primarily from 2023 through 2024.</p>
<p>Certain qualifying costs for these programs were recorded in 2023, 2022 and 2021, and are reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>In connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by 2026.</p>
<p>For a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see Note 3A , The program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.</p>
<h2>Other (Income)/Deductions--Net</h2>
<p>The favorable period-over-period change of $1.1 billion was primarily driven by net gains on equity securities in 2023 versus net losses recognized on equity securities in 2022 and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges. See</p>
<p>Note 4 .</p>
<h2>Upjohn Separation Costs</h2>
<p>Since inception through December 31, 2023, we have incurred substantially all costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, including costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.</p>
<h2>Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income</h2>

<p>For information about our effective tax rate and the events and circumstances contributing to the changes between periods, as well as details about discrete elements that impacted our tax provisions, see Note 5 .</p>
<p>Changes in Tax Laws-Many countries outside the U.S. have enacted legislation for global minimum taxation resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting "Pillar 2" project. The EU has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate the OECD provisions into their respective domestic laws, and other countries outside the EU are also enacting the provisions into their domestic law. The provisions are generally effective for Pfizer in 2024, though significant details and guidance around the provisions are still pending. Income tax expense could be adversely affected as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, and such impact could be material to our results of operations. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries.</p>

<h2>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<p>A comprehensive update of Pfizer's development pipeline was published as of January 30, 2024 and is available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.</p>
<p>This section provides information as of the date of this filing about significant marketing application-related regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU and Japan.</p>
<p>The tables below include filing and approval milestones for products that have occurred in the last twelve months and generally do not include approvals that may have occurred prior to that time. The tables include filings with regulatory decisions pending (even if the filing occurred outside of the last twelve-month period).</p>
<h2>COVID-19 Vaccine Products</h2>
<p>Beginning with the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, initially authorized for emergency use, to Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA, 2023-2024 Formula), approved by the FDA for individuals 12 years and older and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (2023-2024 Formula) authorized by the FDA for emergency use for individuals 6 months through 11 years of age, efforts to stay current with circulating COVID-19 strains have resulted in the rapid development of targeted, adapted vaccines for licensure in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets. The adapted vaccines have included two bivalent formulations (Original and Omicron BA.1, not authorized in the U.S., and Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5). As updated COVID-19 vaccines are formulated to more closely target currently circulating vaccines, prior vaccine formulations are generally no longer utilized in a majority of the markets.</p>
<p>The 2023-2024 Formula includes a monovalent (single) component that corresponds to the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). The table below summarizes the approval of the 2023-2024 Formula in the markets indicated:</p>

<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME</h2>
<p>Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:</p>
<p>| Measure | Definition | Relevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition- related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items (a) | · Provides investors useful information to: · evaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their | Adjusted income |
| Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions -- net Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses and Other (income)/deductions--net before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition- | components, on a comparable year- over-year basis · assist in modeling expected future performance on a normalized basis · Provides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our , each related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are (a) | components of the Adjusted income measure |
| EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, | recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management before the (b) (a) | Adjusted diluted EPS |</p>
<p>Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders-diluted , respectively.</p>
<p>We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&amp;D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS</h2>
<p>Amortization of Intangible Assets -Adjusted income excludes all amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Acquisition-Related Items --Adjusted income excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.</p>
<p>The significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.</p>
<p>Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.</p>

<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Discontinued Operations --Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.</p>
<p>Certain Significant Items --Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.</p>

| Operating activities from continuing operations | $ 8,700 | $ 29,267 | $ 32,922 | The change was driven primarily by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by net changes in inventory greater than one year (see Note 8A ). |
| Investing activities from continuing operations | $ (32,278) | $ (15,783) | $ (22,534) | cash acquired, compared with $23.0 billion cash paid in 2022 for acquisitions (Biohaven, $11.5 billion, Arena, $6.2 billion and GBT, $5.2 billion), net of cash acquired (see Note 2A ), as well as a $4.0 billion dividend received from the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2022 that was allocated to investing activities (see Note 2C ), partially offset by a $5.5 billion increase in net redemptions of short-term investments in 2023 and a $1.7 billion decrease in purchases of long-term investments. |
| Financing activities from continuing operations | $ 26,066 | $ (14,834) | $ (9,816) | The change was driven mostly by $30.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in May of 2023 and a $7.9 billion increase in net proceeds from the issuance of short-term borrowings. |</p>
<h2>ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Our historically robust operating cash flow, which we expect to continue over time, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We believe as a result of this, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>We focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital. Excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities which consist of primarily high-quality, highly liquid, welldiversified debt securities. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may obtain funding through short-term or long-term sources from our access to the capital markets, banking relationships and relationships with other financial intermediaries to meet our liquidity needs.</p>

<p>Financing for Seagen Acquisition --As part of the financing for our acquisition of Seagen, we issued $31 billion of long-term debt in May 2023 and $8 billion of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2023. The net proceeds from long-term debt were invested in short-term investments in a combination of money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities until the completion of the acquisition.</p>

<p>Credit Ratings --The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&amp;P and Moody's. In March 2023, following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Seagen, Moody's changed its outlook on our long-term debt to Negative; S&amp;P downgraded our short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1. In October 2023, following the announcement of the amended Paxlovid supply agreement with the U.S. government and updated 2023 guidance, S&amp;P changed its outlook on our long-term debt to Negative. In December 2023, following the release of 2024 guidance (i) Moody's downgraded our long-term rating from A1 to A2 and changed its outlook on our long-term debt to Stable and (ii) S&amp;P downgraded our long-term rating from A+ to A and changed its outlook on our long-term debt to Stable.</p>

| S&amp;P | A-1 | A | Stable Outlook |</p>
<p>These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.</p>
<p>Capital Allocation Framework --Our capital allocation framework is primarily devised to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars: growing our dividend, reinvesting in the business and making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Business and Strategy section within MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer's BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. On December 14, 2023, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.42 per share, payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 26, 2024. The first-quarter 2024 cash dividend will be our 341st consecutive quarterly dividend.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations --In the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 16B .</p>
<p>Additionally, certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products. Furthermore, collaboration, licensing or other R&amp;D arrangements may give rise to potential milestone payments. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.</p>
<p>Our significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Long-term debt, including current portion (see Note 7D ) and related interest payments;</li>
<li>· Estimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation estimated tax liability (see Note 5 ). Estimated future payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax liability that will occur after December 31, 2023 total $6.0 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months and an estimated $4.5 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards;</li>
<li>· Certain commitments totaling $5.2 billion, of which an estimated $1.3 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months, and $3.9 billion in periods thereafter (see Note 16C );</li>
<li>· Purchases of PP&amp;E (see Note 9 ). In 2024, we expect to spend approximately $3.7 billion on PP&amp;E and</li>
<li>· Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (see Note 15 ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Global Economic Conditions --Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey operations function in a hyperinflationary economy. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Global Operations section.</p>
<p>Market Risk --We are subject to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address such exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. For more information on how we manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risks, see Notes 1F and 7E , as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section for key currencies in which we operate. Our sensitivity analyses of such risks are discussed below.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency's rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect on another currency's rates relative to the U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to move against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2023, the expected impact on our net income would not be significant.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point change in interest rates as of December 31, 2023, the expected impact on our net income would not be significant.</p>
<p>Equity Price Risk--We hold long-term investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions (see Note 7B ). While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. From time to time, we will sell</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected impact on our net income would not be significant.</p>

<h2>FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</h2>
<h2>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</h2>
<h2>To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pfizer Inc.:</h2>
<p>Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements</p>
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>Basis for Opinion</h2>
<p>These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<h2>Critical Audit Matters</h2>
<p>The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual</p>
<p>As discussed in Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company's revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company's estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits</h2>
<p>As discussed in Notes 5D and 1Q , the Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.8 billion.</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company's interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the Company's liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Company's tax positions may not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estimation and recording of the gross</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company's interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the Company's assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.</p>
<p>Evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation</p>
<p>As discussed in Notes 1S and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings requires a complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's judgments about future events and uncertainties.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Company's external and internal legal counsel that described the Company's probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings. We inspected the Company's minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters. We evaluated the Company's ability to estimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the fair value measurement of the developed technology rights and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the Seagen business combination</p>
<p>As discussed in Note 2A to the consolidated financial statements, on December 14, 2023, the Company acquired Seagen Inc. and its subsidiaries (Seagen). The total fair value of consideration transferred was $44.2 billion. Of that, the Company provisionally recorded $7.5 billion of developed technology rights with an estimated weighted-average life of approximately 18 years and $20.8 billion of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D).</p>
<p>We identified the evaluation of the fair value measurement of the acquired developed technology rights and IPR&amp;D as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain key assumptions used to estimate the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired developed technology rights and IPR&amp;D. Specifically, the key assumptions for certain IPR&amp;D assets, including revenue growth rates, probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) rates, and the discount rate, and the key assumptions for certain developed technology rights, including revenue growth rates and the discount rate, represented subjective determinations of future market and economic conditions. Changes to those assumptions could have had a significant effect on the determination of the fair value measurements.</p>
<p>The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's acquisition-date valuation process, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions for certain IPR&amp;D assets and developed technology rights. We performed sensitivity analyses over the key assumptions for certain IPR&amp;D assets and developed technology rights to assess the impact of changes in those key assumptions on the Company's determination of the fair value of the IPR&amp;D and developed technology rights, respectively. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing them to historical results for comparable products and peer companies, analyst expectations, and industry related third-party data. Further, we evaluated the PTRS rates for certain IPR&amp;D assets by considering the phase of development of the clinical projects and the Company's history of obtaining regulatory approval and comparing them to PTRS rates derived from analyst reports and other indu stry related third-party data. We evaluated the data sources used by management in determining the key assumptions for certain IPR&amp;D assets and developed technology rights by comparing to industry standards and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) evaluating the discount rates used by the Company for certain IPR&amp;D and developed technology rights by comparing them against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities</li>
<li>(2) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have not been able to determine the specific year that we or our predecessor firms began serving as the Company's auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor firms have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1942.</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<h2>Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>A. Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The decision of whether or not to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.</p>
<p>In 2023, we managed our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 17 .</p>
<p>On December 14, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Seagen. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. In addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2023, 2022 and 2021 impacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2 .</p>
<p>We have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.</p>
<h2>B . New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023</h2>
<p>On January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial statements. See Note 8C .</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023. We applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>C. Estimates and Assumptions</h2>
<p>In preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p>Our estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change.</p>
<h2>D. Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&amp;D be recorded on the balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&amp;D is expensed in Acquired in-process research and development expenses .</p>
<p>Contingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair value is generally estimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D . Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in Other (income)/deductions--net .</p>
<h2>E. Fair Value</h2>
<p>We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants,</p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and after the transfer.</p>
<p>When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.</li>
<li>· Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>· Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).</li>
<li>· Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).</li>
<li>· Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Available-for-sale debt securities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yield curves.</li>
<li>· Equity securities with readily determinable fair values-quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.</li>
<li>· Derivative assets and liabilities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models use market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.</li>
<li>· Money market funds-observable NAV prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>We periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial instruments.</p>
<h2>F. Foreign Currency Translation</h2>
<p>For most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.</p>
<h2>G. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable</h2>
<p>Revenue Recognition --We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer. For certain contracts, the finished product may temporarily be stored at our or our third-party subcontractors' locations under a bill-and-hold arrangement. Revenue is recognized on bill-and-hold arrangements at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product and all of the following criteria have been met: the arrangement is substantive; the product is identified separately as belonging to the customer; the product is ready for physical transfer to the customer; and we do not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer. In bill-and-hold arrangements which are part of the U.S. Government Strategic National Stockpile, we recognize revenue for the product sale when the product is initially placed into the Stockpile and we provide a rotation service to maintain an agreed upon level of shelf life for product in the stockpile. In determining when the customer obtains control of the product, we consider certain indicators, including whether we have a present right to payment from the customer, whether title and/or significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and whether customer acceptance has been received.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2023, we began reporting Product revenues and Alliance revenues as separate line items in our consolidated statements of income. Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.</p>
<p>Our Sales Contracts --Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns may occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.</p>
<p>Deductions from Revenues --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these product revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.</p>
<p>Provisions for pharmaceutical sales returns-Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could</p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.</p>
<p>We record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.</p>
<p>The following outlines our common sales arrangements:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Customers --Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid in 2022 and 2023, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In 2022 and 2023, we principally sold Paxlovid globally to government agencies. Our vaccines in the U.S. are primarily sold directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Our vaccines outside the U.S. are primarily sold to government and non-government institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specifically:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performancebased contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period's sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare "coverage gap," also known as the "doughnut hole," based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.</li>
<li>· Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government's total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.</li>
<li>· Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2023, for each of ten products in 2022 and for each of nine products in 2021. In the aggregate, these direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues represented 64%, 82% and 75% of our Total revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 17C . The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:</p>
<p>| | As of December 31, | As of December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (MILLIONS) | 2023 | 2022 |
| Reserve against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts | $ 1,770 | $ 1,200 |
| Other current liabilities : | | |
| Accrued rebates | 5,546 | 4,479 |
| Other accruals | 902 | 430 |
| Other noncurrent liabilities | 796 | 612 |
| Total accrued rebates and other sales-related accruals | $ 9,014 | $ 6,722 |</p>
<p>Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Product revenues .</p>
<p>Trade Accounts Receivable -Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.</p>
<p>In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.</p>
<p>During 2023 and 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>H. Collaborative Arrangements</h2>
<p>Payments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-commercialization agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration partners as Alliance revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration partners as Cost of sales . Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions-net.</p>
<p>Reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses . Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as Acquired in-process r esearch and development expenses . Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in Identifiable intangible assets -developed technology rights. Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net over the development period for the products, when our performance obligations include providing R&amp;D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone payments earned by us may be recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.</p>
<h2>I. Cost of Sales and Inventories</h2>
<p>Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary. Inventories that are not expected to be sold within 12 months are classified as Other noncurrent assets . See Note 8A .</p>
<h2>J. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and handling, digital and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $3.7 billion in 2023, $2.8 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021. Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of TV, radio, and other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.</p>
<h2>K. Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&amp;D efforts, as well as R&amp;D activities performed in connection with certain licensing arrangements.</p>
<h2>L. Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing and collaboration arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter. Acquired in-process research and development expenses includes costs incurred in connection with (a) all upfront and milestone payments on collaboration and in-license agreements, including premiums on equity securities and (b) asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&amp;D.</p>
<h2>M. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets</h2>
<p>Long-lived assets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Property, plant and equipment , less accumulated depreciation-These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.</li>
<li>· Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization -These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>· Goodwill -Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets is included in Amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p>We review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>· For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.</li>
<li>· For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&amp;D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&amp;D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.</li>
<li>· For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the implied fair value.</li>
</ul>
<h2>N. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<p>We incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>· In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and</li>
<li>· In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Included in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired company. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred .</p>
<p>Our business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&amp;D, as well as our corporate enabling functions.</p>
<h2>O. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows</h2>
<p>Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments .</p>
<p>Cash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrument. Cash flows for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.</p>
<h2>P. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Our investments are primarily comprised of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Public equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions-net.</li>
<li>· Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.</li>
<li>· Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.</li>
<li>· Private equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.</li>
<li>· For equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investee's income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions-net . The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee, with any remaining</li>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include contingent consideration.</p>
<p>Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.</p>
<p>We regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, if and when a decline in fair value is determined, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. For equity-method investments, an impairment charge is recorded only if and when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary.</p>
<p>Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in certain balance sheet categories (see Note 7A ), with changes in fair value reported in net income or, for certain qualifying hedging relationships, in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E ).</p>
<h2>Q. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies</h2>
<p>Tax Assets and Liabilities --Current tax assets primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to future tax obligations.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.</p>
<p>The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&amp;A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.</p>
<p>Other non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Other taxes payable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment over eight years through 2026. See Note 5D for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA.</p>
<p>Income Tax Contingencies --We account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.</p>
<p>We regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to "more likely than not"; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.</p>
<p>Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.</p>
<h2>R. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net . We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans (mark-to-market accounting). Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss is recognized immediately and classified as Other (income)/deductions--net . We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value.</p>

<h2>S. Legal and Environmental Contingencies</h2>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.</p>
<h2>T. Share-Based Payments</h2>
<p>Our compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally amortized on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated attribution approach over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.</p>

<h2>A. Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Seagen-On December 14, 2023 (the acquisition date), we acquired Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $44.2 billion ($43.4 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, in connection with the acquisition $476 million in post-closing compensation expense for Seagen employee incentive awards was recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3 ). The combination of local Pfizer and Seagen entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps.</p>
<p>Seagen's principal business was the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of targeted cancer therapeutics, primarily using antibody-drug conjugate technology. Seagen's portfolio includes four approved medicines as well as a pipeline of product candidates. Clinical development programs are ongoing for each of these approved medicines for potential new or expanded indications and for several product candidates. We believe our acquisition of Seagen will strengthen our oncology capabilities by allowing us to combine Seagen's antibody-drug conjugate technology with the resources and scale of the Pfizer enterprise and to advance more potential breakthroughs to patients with cancer.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the provisional amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The estimated values are not yet finalized (see below) and are subject to change, which could be significant. We will finalize the amounts recognized as we obtain the information necessary to complete the analyses. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.</p>

<h2>The following items are subject to change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Amounts for certain balances included in working capital (excluding inventories), and certain legal contingencies, pending receipt of certain information that could affect provisional amounts recorded. We do not believe any adjustments for legal contingencies will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</li>
<li>· Amounts for identifiable intangible assets, inventories, contractual commitments, PP&amp;E, and operating lease ROU assets and liabilities, pending finalization of valuation efforts, the completion of certain physical inventory counts and the confirmation of the physical existence and condition of certain PP&amp;E assets.</li>

<ul>
<li>· Amounts for income tax assets, receivables and liabilities, pending the filing of Seagen's pre-acquisition tax returns and the receipt of information, including but not limited to that from taxing authorities, which may change certain estimates and assumptions used.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of the acquisition date, the fair value of accounts receivable approximated the book value acquired. The gross contractual amount receivable was $597 million.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, Seagen may incur liabilities for environmental, legal and tax matters, as well as guarantees and indemnifications. These matters may include contingencies. Except as specifically excluded by the relevant accounting standard, contingencies are required to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date if the acquisitiondate fair value of the asset or liability arising from a contingency can be determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of the asset or liability cannot be determined, the asset or liability would be recognized at the acquisition date if both of the following criteria are met: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or that a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date, and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Environmental Matters -In the ordinary course of business, Seagen may incur liabilities for environmental matters such as remediation work, asset retirement obligations and environmental guarantees and indemnifications.</li>
<li>· Legal Matters -Seagen is involved in various legal proceedings, including patent, intellectual property, and product liability matters of a nature considered normal to its business. The contingencies arising from legal matters are not significant to our consolidated financial statements.</li>
<li>· Tax Matters -In the ordinary course of business, Seagen incurs liabilities for income taxes. Income taxes are exceptions to both the recognition and fair value measurement principles associated with the accounting for business combinations. Reserves for income tax contingencies continue to be measured under the benefit recognition model previously used by Seagen (see Note 1Q ). Net liabilities for income taxes as of the acquisition date were $6.1 billion, including $56 million for uncertain tax positions. The net tax liability includes $7.5 billion for the tax impact of fair value adjustments, partially offset by $1.4 billion for deferred tax assets on which Seagen had recognized a valuation allowance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Seagen includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the expected specific synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of Seagen with the operations of Pfizer;</li>
<li>· any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, as well as future, as yet unidentified projects and products; and</li>
<li>· the value of the going-concern element of Seagen's existing businesses (the higher rate of return on the assembled collection of net assets versus if Pfizer had acquired all of the net assets separately).</li>
</ul>
<p>Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill related to the acquisition of Seagen is related to our Biopharma segment (see Note 10 ).</p>
<p>Actual and Pro Forma Impact of Acquisition-The following table presents information for Seagen's operations that are included in Pfizer's consolidated statements of income beginning from the acquisition date, December 14, 2023, through Pfizer's year-end in 2023:</p>
<p>| (MILLIONS) | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- |
| Revenues | 120 |
| Net loss attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders (a) | (746) |</p>
<p>Includes restructuring, integration and acquisition-related costs ($614 million pre-tax) and purchase accounting charges related to (i) the preliminary fair value adjustment for acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold ($109 million pre-tax); (ii) amortization expense related to the preliminary fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired from Seagen ($ 25 million pre-tax); as well as (iii) depreciation expense related to the preliminary fair value adjustment of fixed assets acquired from Seagen ($2 million pre-tax). (a)</p>
<p>The following table provides unaudited U.S. GAAP supplemental pro forma information as if the acquisition of Seagen had occurred on January 1, 2022:</p>
<p>| | Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Consolidated Results Year Ended December 31, | Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Consolidated Results Year Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) | 2023 | 2022 |
| Revenues | 60,632 | 102,127 |
| Net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders | (1,474) | 27,938 |
| Diluted earnings/(loss) per share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders | (0.26) | 4.87 |</p>
<p>The unaudited supplemental pro forma consolidated results do not purport to reflect what the combined company's results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor do they project the future results of operations of the combined company or reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated with the acquisition. The actual results of operations of the combined company may differ significantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected here due to many factors.</p>
<p>The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes various assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Seagen. The historical U.S. GAAP financial information of Pfizer and Seagen was adjusted, primarily for the following pre-tax adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Additional amortization expense (approximately $503 million in 2023 and $526 million in 2022) related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired.</li>
</ul>

<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<ul>
<li>· Additional expense related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory estimated to have been sold (approximately $796 million in 2023 and $887 million in 2022).</li>
<li>· Additional interest expense (approximately $984 million in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022) related to the estimated debt issued by Pfizer and the commercial paper borrowings to partially finance the acquisition.</li>
<li>· Elimination of interest income (approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and $267 million in 2022) related to the debt issuance proceeds that were invested prior to the acquisition date and associated with money market funds under the assumption that a portion of these funds would have been liquidated to partially fund the acquisition.</li>
<li>· Adjustment to move Seagen royalty income received from collaboration partners (approximately $203 million in 2023 and $165 million in 2022) from total revenues to other (income)/deductions, which is consistent with Pfizer's presentation in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above adjustments were then adjusted for the applicable tax impact using an estimated weighted-average statutory tax rate applied to the applicable pro forma adjustments.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Seagen had no impact on Pfizer's weighted-average shares as no shares were issued.</p>
<p>GBT-On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease, for $68.50 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $136 million in payments to GBT employees for the fair value of previously unvested long-term incentive awards was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3 ).</p>
<p>The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $3.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $1.4 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of six years, (ii) $1.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $644 million of inventories to be sold over approximatelythree years, (iv) $516 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Biohaven-On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. The transaction included the acquisition of Biohaven's CGRP programs, including rimegepant, zavegepant and a portfolio of five pre-clinical CGRP assets. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Biohaven not already owned by us for $148.50 per share, in cash, for payments of approximately $11.5 billion, plus repayment of third-party debt of $863 million and redemption of Biohaven's redeemable preferred stock for $495 million. Effective immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition, Biohaven completed the spin-off of Biohaven Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN), distributing Biohaven Ltd.'s shares to Biohaven shareholders. Biohaven Ltd. became a new publicly traded company that retained Biohaven's non-CGRP development stage pipeline compounds. Pfizer, a Biohaven shareholder, received a pro rata portion of Biohaven Ltd.'s shares in the distribution and owns approximately 1.3% of Biohaven Ltd. as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>This acquisition follows on the November 2021 collaboration for the commercialization of rimegepant and zavegepant outside the U.S., in connection with which Pfizer acquired2.6% of Biohaven's common stock (see Note 2E ). Biohaven Ltd. also has the right to receive tiered royalties from Pfizer on any annual net sales of rimegepant and zavegepant in the U.S. in excess of $5.25 billion. This contingent consideration was determined to have no fair value as of the acquisition date. Pfizer also acquired Biohaven's commitments for payment of high single digit to mid-teen percentage tiered royalties on world-wide net sales excluding China and low to high single digit royalties on net sales in China of rimegepant and zavegepant as well as certain regulatory approval and commercial milestone payments associated with rimegepant and zavegepant of up to $1.1 billion under pre-existing third-party license and other agreements. These milestone amounts have been reduced by $608 million since the acquisition due to payments made and renegotiation of certain of the applicable agreements.</p>
<p>The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the fair value of Pfizer's previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300 million. The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of 11 years and $450 million of IPR&amp;D, (ii) $823 million of Goodwill , (iii) $813 million of inventories to be sold over approximatelytwo years, (iv) $398 million of trade accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $544 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (vii) $526 million of Other current liabilities .</p>
<p>Arena-On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company with development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology and cardiology, for $100 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $138 million in payments to Arena employees for the fair value of previously unvested long-term incentive awards was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs (see Note 3 ).</p>
<p>The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in Identifiable intangible assets , consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&amp;D and $460 million of indefinite-lived licensing agreements and other, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill and (iii) $490 million of net deferred tax liabilities.</p>
<p>ReViral-On June 9, 2022, we acquired ReViral, a privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel antiviral therapeutics that target respiratory syncytial virus, for a total consideration of up to $536 million, including upfront payments of $436 million upon closing (including a base payment of $425 million plus working capital adjustments) and an additional $100 million contingent upon a future development milestone for a secondary pipeline asset. It was subsequently determined the applicable milestone was not achieved.</p>
<p>We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, sisunatovir, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $426 million charge representing an acquired IPR&amp;D asset with no alternative</p>

<p>use in Acquired in-process research and development expenses , which is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. Other assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not significant.</p>
<p>Trillium-On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium's lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.</p>
<p>We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&amp;D asset with no alternative future use in Acquired in-process research and development expenses , of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.</p>
<p>Pro forma information for the aforementioned acquisitions (except for Seagen) has not been presented because these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>B. Divestitures</h2>
<p>Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio-On September 19, 2023, we completed an agreement with Alexion, under which Alexion purchased and licensed the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, consisting of an upfront payment of $300 million which was paid at closing and future contingent milestone payments, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. In connection with the closing of the transaction, Pfizer recognized a $222 million pre-tax gain in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4 ).</p>
<h2>Discontinued Operations</h2>
<p>Meridian-On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in Discontinued operations--net of tax . In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship after the sale, including interim TSAs and an MSA. Services under the TSAs are completed as of December 31, 2023. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period. Amounts recorded under the interim TSAs and MSA in 2023 and 2022 were not material to our operations. No amounts were recorded under these arrangements in 2021.</p>
<p>Upjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan-In connection with the 2020 spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements, including a separation and distribution agreement, interim operating models, including agency arrangements, MSAs, TSAs, a tax matters agreement, and an employee matters agreement, among others. The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from four to seven years post-separation. Services under the TSAs were largely completed as of December 31, 2023. Amounts recorded under the above agreements in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material to our operations. Net amounts due to Viatris under the above agreements were $33 million as of December 31, 2023 and $94 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flows associated with the above agreements are included in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for a $277 million payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms of the separation agreement, which is reported in Other financing activities, net .</p>

<h2>C. Equity-Method Investments</h2>
<p>Haleon/Consumer Healthcare JV-On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical consumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of Haleon as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $11.5 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported in Equity-method investments . The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of December 31, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to our share of Haleon's earnings of $489 million as well as $280 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6 ), partially offset by $153 million in dividends. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net . Our total share of Haleon's earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in 2023, was $489 million. Our total share of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV's earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in 2022, was $536 million. Our total share of the JV's earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, which we recorded in our operating results in 2021, was $495 million. As part of the initial accounting for our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, we determined that the difference between the initial fair value of our investment less our underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV resulted in an initial excess basis difference of $4.8 billion. We allocated the difference primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities, and equity-method goodwill. We recognize amortization of these basis differences in Other (income)/deductions--net . Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years. In 2022, our equity-method income included in Other (income)/ deductions--net also included charges of $100 million, primarily for adjustments to our equity-method basis differences related to the separation of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV from GSK. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV was not material to our results of operations in 2023 and 2021.

<p>In connection with GSK's previously announced planned demerger of at least80% of GSK's 68% equity interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV, in March 2022 the Consumer Healthcare JV completed its offering of a total aggregate principal amount of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes of various maturities, €2.35 billion in eurodenominated senior notes of various maturities and £700 million in U.K. pound-denominated senior notes of various maturities (collectively, the "notes"). The notes were guaranteed by GSK generally up to and excluding the date of the demerger (the "Guarantee Assumption Date"). We agreed to indemnify GSK for 32% (representing our pro rata equity interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV) of any amount payable by GSK pursuant to its guarantee of the notes. Our indemnity was provided solely for the benefit of GSK. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were an issuer or guarantor of any of the notes.</p>
<p>Following its issuance of the notes in March 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the Consumer Healthcare JV loaned to us and GSK the net proceeds received from the notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of1.365% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears. In conjunction with the demerger, we received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV in July 2022, of which $4.0 billion related to a one-time pre-separation dividend, which decreased the carrying value of our investment and are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities . Simultaneous with the receipt of the dividends, we repaid the £2.9 billion loan from the JV. GSK similarly received pro rata dividends and simultaneously repaid its pro rata loan from the JV. In conjunction with these transactions, our indemnification of GSK's guarantee discussed above was terminated.</p>
<p>Investment in ViiV-In 2009, we and GSK created ViiV, which is focused on research, development and commercialization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines. We own approximately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investment under the equity method due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investment was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cumulative equity-method losses and dividends, and therefore we no longer record our proportionate share of ViiV's net income (loss) in our results of operations. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from ViiV as income in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $265 million in 2023, $314 million in 2022 and $166 million in 2021 (see Note 4 ).</p>
<p>Summarized financial information for our equity-method investee, ViiV, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:</p>

<h2>D. Licensing Arrangement</h2>
<p>Agreement with Valneva-In June 2022, we entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement, under which we invested €90.5 million ($95 million) in Valneva to further support our arrangement to co-develop and commercialize Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which we originally entered into with Valneva in 2020. In addition, we updated the terms of our existing co-development and commercialization agreement for VLA15. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs, and we will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%, compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition, the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other early commercialization milestones are unchanged. As of December 31, 2023, we held a 6.9% equity stake of Valneva.</p>
<h2>E. Collaborative Arrangements</h2>
<p>We enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity. Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product or vaccine.</p>
<p>Collaboration with Biohaven-In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven and certain of its subsidiaries to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Biohaven would lead R&amp;D globally and we would have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. We recognized $263 million for the upfront payment and premium paid on our equity investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses . In October 2022, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Biohaven not already owned by us for $148.50 per share, in cash, for payments of approximately $11.5 billion. See Note 2A . This acquisition represented a settlement of the preexisting relationship, and we determined that no gain or loss was required to be recognized.</p>
<p>Collaborations with BioNTech-On December 30, 2021, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster virus) based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology and our antigen technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech $225 million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to BioNTech was recorded to Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of any product. As of December 31, 2023, we held an equity stake of 2.7% of BioNTech.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, which resulted in the development of Comirnaty. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021 agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50 percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&amp;D costs are being shared equally. We have commercialization rights to the vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We recognize revenues and cost of sales on a gross basis in markets where we are commercializing the vaccine and we record our share of gross profits related to sales of the vaccine by BioNTech in Germany and Turkey in Alliance revenues .</p>
<p>Collaboration with Beam-On December 24, 2021, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beam's in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. Under the terms of the agreement, Beam conducts all research activities through development candidate selection for three undisclosed targets, which are not included in Beam's existing programs, and we may opt in to obtain exclusive licenses to each development candidate. Beam has a right to opt in, at the end of phase 1/2 studies, upon the payment by Beam of an option exercise fee, to a global co-development and cocommercialization agreement with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration pursuant to which we and Beam would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a 65%/35% ratio (Pfizer/Beam). Upon entering into the agreement, we recorded $300 million in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an upfront payment due to Beam, and if we exercise our opt in to licenses for all three targets, Beam will be eligible for up to an additional $1.05 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for a potential total deal consideration of up to $1.35 billion. Beam is also eligible to receive royalties on global net sales for each licensed program.</p>

<p>Collaboration with Arvinas-On July 21, 2021, we entered into a global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader. The estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers. In connection with the agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $650 million to Arvinas and we made a $350 million equity investment in the common stock of Arvinas. We recognized $706 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on our equity investment in Acquired in-process research and development expenses in our third quarter of 2021. Arvinas is also eligible to receive up to $400 million in approval milestones and up to $1 billion in commercial milestones. The companies equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses and profits. As of December 31, 2023, we held a 5.1% equity stake of Arvinas. ®</p>

<p>The amounts outlined in the above table do not include transactions with third parties other than our collaboration partners, or other costs for the products under the collaborative arrangements.</p>
<h2>F. Research and Development Arrangement</h2>
<p>Research and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone-In April 2023, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will receive up to a total of $550 million in 2023 through 2026 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and development expenses in 2023 was $175 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.</p>
<h2>Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives</h2>
<h2>A. Restructuring Programs</h2>
<p>Transforming to a More Focused Company Program-In 2019, we announced that we would be incurring costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company Program, a multi-year effort to ensure our cost base aligned appropriately with our operating structure following Pfizer's transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based global biopharmaceutical business. This program included activities to (i) restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our operating structure; (ii) transform our commercial go-to-market model; and (iii) optimize our manufacturing network and R&amp;D operations. The costs to restructure our corporate enabling functions, and to optimize our R&amp;D operations and reduce cycle times, as well as to further prioritize our internal R&amp;D portfolio, primarily included severance and implementation costs. The costs to optimize our manufacturing network largely included severance, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, and accelerated depreciation. From the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2023, we incurred costs of $4.0 billion, of which $1.5 billion ($1.0 billion of restructuring charges) was associated with our Biopharma segment and have substantially completed this program.</p>

<p>Realigning our Cost Base Program-In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. We expect costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2024 and to total approximately $3.0 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance and implementation costs, of which $1.1 billion is associated with our Biopharma segment.</p>
<p>In 2023, we incurred costs under this program of $1.7 billion, of which $674 million (including $665 million of restructuring charges) is associated with our Biopharma segment.</p>

<ul>
<li>The decrease in net interest expense in 2023 reflects higher interest expense driven by our $ 31 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued in May 2023 as part of the financing for our acquisition of Seagen, which was more than offset by higher interest income on the investment of the net proceeds from the debt issuance. (b)</li>
<li>2023 primarily includes certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer and legal obligations related to pre-acquisition matters. 2022 primarily included certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. 2021 primarily included certain product liability expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer, and to a lesser extent, legal obligations related to pre-acquisition matters. (e)</li>
<li>2023 primarily represents intangible asset impairment charges of $ 3.0 billion, of which $ 2.9 billion is associated with our Biopharma segment ($ 2.8 billion recorded in the fourth quarter), including: $ 1.4 billion for etrasimod (Velsipity) IPR&amp;D, based on a change in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations, $964 million for Prevnar 13 developed technology rights ($ 834 million for pediatric and $ 130 million for adult), due to updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting a transition to higher serotype coverage, and $486 million for various other IPR&amp;D assets and developed technology rights, due to updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures and/or prioritization decisions. 2023 also includes $128 million associated with Other business activities, related to IPR&amp;D and developed technology rights for acquired software assets and reflects unfavorable pivotal trial results and updated commercial forecasts. 2022 represented intangible asset impairment charges associated with our Biopharma segment of: $200 million for an IPR&amp;D asset for the unapproved indication of symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy due to a mutation of the gene encoding the lamin A/C protein that resulted from the Phase 3 trial reaching futility at a pre-planned interim analysis and $171 million for developed technology rights due to updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures. 2022 also included intangible asset impairment charges of $ 50 million associated with PC1, related to finite-lived licensing agreements and reflected updated contract manufacturing forecasts reflecting changes to market dynamics.

<li>Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2023. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

<p>The changes in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below:</p>
<h2>2023 v. 2022</h2>
<p>The tax benefit of $1.1 billion for 2023 compared to the tax provision of $3.3 billion for 2022 was primarily a result of changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the resolution of uncertain tax positions in various markets. The 2023 pre-tax income included a greater percentage of expenses taxed at higher rates as compared to the 2022 pre-tax income, resulting in a 2023 tax benefit compared to the 2022 tax provision. These expenses included amortization expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and intangible asset impairment charges. The tax benefit for 2023 and the tax provision for 2022 included tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years. The tax provision for 2022 also included the closing of U.S. IRS audits covering five tax years.</p>
<h2>2022 v. 2021</h2>
<p>The higher effective tax rate in 2022 was mainly the result of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the non-recurrence of certain initiatives executed in 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable,</li>
</ul>
<p>partially offset by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· tax benefits in 2022 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years that included the closing of U.S. IRS audits covering five tax years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Note 2A ).</p>
<p>We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date. The sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of December 31, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.</p>

| Effective tax rate for income from continuing operations | (105.4) % | 9.6 % | 7.6 % |</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher rate percentages for the 2023 reconciling items are significantly impacted by the lower domestic and international Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Note 5A ) For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called "Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions," as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called "Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions" is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre-tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the location of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income . (a)</li>
<li>In all years, the reduction in our effective tax rate is a result of the jurisdictional location of earnings and is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for our subsidiaries in Singapore and, to a lesser extent, in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican tax incentives pursuant to a grant that expires during 2053. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2048 on income from manufacturing and other operations. (b) (c)</li>
<li>See Note 5A . (c)</li>
<li>The higher rate benefit from the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction in 2022 is mainly the result of the TCJA requirement to capitalize R&amp;D costs for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. (d)</li>
<li>Includes the impact of U.S. state and local taxes and changes in the state valuation allowances including those related to the acquisition of Seagen. (e) (f)</li>
<li>Includes changes in interest related to our uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called "Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions". (f)</li>
<li>All other, net is primarily due to routine business operations. (g)</li>

<ul>
<li>The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with global intangible low-taxed income are included in the relevant categories. See Note 1Q . (a)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in deferred tax assets in 2023 is primarily related to temporary differences associated with the non-cash revenue reversal for Paxlovid recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. See Note 17C . The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2023 is primarily due to the acquisition of inventories related to Seagen, partially offset by the temporary differences associated with the non-cash charges for inventory write(c)</p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in net deferred tax assets in 2023 is primarily related to temporary differences associated with the timing of cash tax payments made and accruals recorded in the ordinary course of business. (a) (b)</li>
</ul>
<p>The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2023 is primarily due to changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as well as the performance of plan assets reported in the period. See</p>
<p>We have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2024 to 2043. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $49.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2023 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in the normal course of business based on operational cash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings and profits analysis for such events.</p>

<h2>Uncertain Tax Positions</h2>
<p>As tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2023, we had$3.1 billion and as of December 31, 2022, we had $2.9 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Tax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.7 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.6 billion) and Other taxes payable ($45 million). As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.5 billion) and Other taxes payable ($45 million).</li>
<li>· Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:</h2>
<p>| (MILLIONS) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |

<ul>
<li>Primarily related to effectively settling certain issues with the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. See Note 5A . (b)</li>
<li>· Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income . In 2023, we recorded a net increase in interest of $64 million. In 2022, we recorded a net decrease in interest of $17 million. In 2021, we recorded a net increase in interest of $108 million. Gross accrued interest totaled $605 million as of December 31, 2023 (reflecting a decrease of $11 million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $552 million as of December 31, 2022 (reflecting a decrease of $31 million as a result of cash payments). In 2023 and 2022, these amounts were substantially all included in Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A .</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status of Tax Matters and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions</h2>
<p>The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS.With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years 2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions such as Canada (2017-2023), Europe (2012-2023, primarily in Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2013-2023, primarily in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2023, primarily in Brazil).</p>
<p>Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $100 million , as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.</p>

<h2>E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities</h2>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk-A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.</p>
<p>The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and Chinese renminbi, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.</p>
<p>Changes in fair value are reported in earnings or in Other comprehensive income/(loss) , depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the excluded amount through an amortization approach in earnings. The hedge relationships are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Generally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of the hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the hedged item in earnings.</li>
<li>· Generally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.</li>
<li>· We record in Other comprehensive income/(loss)--Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.</li>
<li>· For foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts take the opposite currency position of that reflected on the balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interest Rate Risk-Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.</p>
<p>We recognize the change in fair value on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings, as well as the offsetting earnings impact of the hedged risk attributable to the hedged item.</p>

<h2>F. Credit Risk</h2>
<p>On an ongoing basis, we monitor and review the credit risk of our customers, financial institutions and exposures in our investment portfolio.</p>
<p>With respect to our trade accounts receivable, we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit in the normal course of business. In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses, see Note 1G . A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 17C .</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>With respect to our investments, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with government, government agency, and corporate issuers of securities. Investments are placed in instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty. As of December 31, 2023, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government money market funds, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S.</p>
<p>With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $768 million, for which we have posted collateral of $771 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments . As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $225 million, for which we have received collateral of $221 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.</p>

<h2>C. Supplier Finance Program Obligation</h2>
<p>We maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating financial institutions. Under these agreements, participating suppliers may voluntarily elect to sell their accounts receivable with Pfizer to these financial institutions. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate and we pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the original maturity dates, which is generally within 90 to 120 days of the invoice date. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Pfizer to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within trade payables in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, $791 million and $849 million of our trade payables to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements were outstanding.</p>

<p>Developed Technology Rights-Developed technology rights represent the cost for developed technology acquired from third parties and can include the right to develop, use, market, sell and/or offer for sale the product, compounds and intellectual property that we have acquired with respect to products, compounds and/or processes that have been completed. We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Nurtec ODT/Vydura, Adcetris, Xtandi, etrasimod (Velsipity), Padcev, Braftovi/Mektovi, Prevnar 13 family and Oxbryta. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Brands-Brands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and DepoMedrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.</p>
<p>IPR&amp;D-IPR&amp;D assets represent the acquisition date fair value (less impairments) of R&amp;D assets acquired through business combinations that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market which could include both new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. The significant components of IPR&amp;D are SGN-B6A, Disitamab vedotin, GBT601, Tukysa, Padcev and talazoparib. IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge. IPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, IPR&amp;D assets may become impaired and/or be written-off in the future.</p>
<p>Licensing Agreements-Licensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array, Arena and Seagen acquisitions. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partners. A</p>

<h2>Note 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans</h2>
<p>The majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.</p>

<p>All of the assumptions are reviewed at least annually. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.</p>
<p>The weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is set with reference to the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2023 resulted in broadly unchanged discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans and higher discount rates for the international pension plans as compared to the prior year.</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of our pension and postretirement plans' assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Cash and cash equivalents: Level 1 investments may include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments may include short-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.</li>
<li>· Equity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted, suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.</li>
<li>· Fixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2 investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.</li>
<li>· Other investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments. Level 3 investments may include securities or insurance contracts that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments as appropriate for lagged reporting of up to three months.</p>
<p>Certain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.</p>
<p>Global plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage net periodic benefit costs and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans' invested assets. Our long-term return expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification, active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change, we may adjust our targets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.</p>
<h2>E. Cash Flows</h2>
<p>It is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax laws.</p>
<p>The following provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:</p>
<p>| | Pension Plans | Pension Plans | |

| 2029-2033 | 4,004 | 2,073 | 218 |</p>
<p>The above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of the benefit obligation.</p>
<h2>F. Defined Contribution Plans</h2>
<p>We have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other countries. For the majority of the U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of their salaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of the employee contributions. We also offer a Retirement Savings Contribution which is an annual non-contributory employer contribution in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of $843 million in 2023, $770 million in 2022 and $732 million in 2021.</p>
<h2>Note 12. Equity</h2>
<h2>A. Common Stock Purchases</h2>
<p>We purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under a share-purchase plan, which is authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December</p>
<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>2018, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 39 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plan. Our remaining sharepurchase authorization was approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>B. Employee Stock Ownership Plans</h2>
<p>We have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2023, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $20 million for 2023 and $19 million for each of 2022 and 2021.</p>
<h2>Note 13. Share-Based Payments</h2>
<p>Our compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and stock options, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our BOD. No BPAs were granted in 2023 and no BPAs were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) provides for 400 million shares to be authorized for grants. The number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares. RSUs count as three shares, and PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2023,248 million shares were available for award, including 68 million shares that we assumed from the remaining shares available from the stock plan of Seagen which can be issued to legacy employees of Seagen and newly hired employees after the date of acquisition once such shares are registered on Form S-8. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.</p>

<h2>Note 15. Leases</h2>
<p>We lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $444 million in 2023, $536 million in 2022 and $381 million in 2021. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.</p>
<p>We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date</p>

<h2>Note 16. Contingencies and Certain Commitments</h2>
<p>We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5D .</p>
<h2>A. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>2023 Form 10-K</p>
<p>95</p>
<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<ul>
<li>· Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.</li>
<li>· Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.</li>
<li>· Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.</p>
<p>We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.</p>
<p>We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p>Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.</p>
<p>The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader's judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.</p>
<h2>A1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation</h2>
<p>We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or copromotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed BMS's appeal and in October 2023, the Supreme Court refused BMS's permission to appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner's patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor's vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.</p>
<p>We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/</p>

<p>licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.</p>
<h2>Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff</h2>
<h2>Xeljanz (tofacitinib)</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.</p>
<p>In October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In November 2022, we filed an additional patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics relating to its challenge of our extended release formulation and method of treatment patents in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.</p>
<p>In June 2023, we brought a patent-infringement action against Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. (collectively Aurobindo) asserting the infringement and validity of our basic compound patent, in connection with Aurobindo's ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets. In December 2023, we reached a settlement agreement with Aurobindo on terms not material to the Company.</p>
<h2>Ibrance (palbociclib)</h2>
<p>Beginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance tablets. We have settled with one of these generic companies on terms not material to us, and have dismissed the patent infringement actions against all other generic companies except for the action against Synthon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its affiliated entities (collectively, Synthon), in which we have asserted the infringement and validity of the composition of matter patent, expiring in 2027. In December 2023, we reached a settlement agreement with Synthon on terms not material to the Company.</p>
<h2>Mektovi (binimetinib)</h2>
<p>Beginning in August 2022, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Mektovi. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2031, two method of use patents expiring in 2033, and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. Beginning in September 2022, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of all six patents.</p>
<p>In August 2022 we received notice from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Teva) that it had filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Mektovi. Teva asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of two method of use patents expiring in 2033 and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. In June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the three patents.</p>
<h2>Vyndaqel-Vyndamax(tafamidis/tafamidis meglumine)</h2>
<p>Beginning in June 2023, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of tafamidis capsules (61 mg) or tafamidis meglumine capsules (20 mg), challenging some or all of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for Vyndamax (tafamidis) and Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine). Scripps Research Institute (Scripps) owns the composition of matter patent and the method of treatment patents covering the products, and Pfizer is the exclusive licensee. Pfizer separately owns the crystalline form patent. Beginning in August 2023, we and Scripps brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents in suit. Pfizer is the sole plaintiff in actions that assert only the infringement and validity of the crystalline form patent.</p>
<h2>Actions in Which We are the Defendant</h2>
<h2>Comirnaty</h2>
<p>In March 2022, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in February 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In July 2022, Alnylam filed a second complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company LLC, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in July 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In May 2023, Alnylam filed a separate complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company LLC alleging that Comirnaty infringes four additional U.S. patents issued on various dates in 2023 and seeking unspecified monetary damages.</p>
<p>In August 2022, ModernaTX, Inc. (ModernaTX) and Moderna US, Inc. (Moderna) sued Pfizer, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Comirnaty infringes three U.S. patents. In its complaint, Moderna stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022.</p>
<p>In August 2022, ModernaTX filed a patent infringement action in Germany against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, alleging that Comirnaty infringes two European patents. The German infringement action was stayed in December 2023 pending further action from the European Patent Office on the patents at issue. In September 2022, ModernaTX filed patent infringement actions in the U.K. and in the Netherlands against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, on the same two European patents. In its complaints, ModernaTX stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022. In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech brought an action against ModernaTX seeking to revoke these two European patents, which was consolidated with the September 2022 action filed by ModernaTX. In November 2023, one of the European patents was revoked by the European Patent Office. In December 2023, the other European patent was declared invalid by a court in the</p>

<p>Netherlands (the invalidity decision is limited to the Netherlands). ModernaTX has also filed additional patent infringement actions against Pfizer and BioNTech in certain other ex-U.S. jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In April 2023, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Arbutus) and Genevant Sciences GmbH (Genevant) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Pfizer and BioNTech alleging that Comirnaty and its manufacture infringe five U.S. patents, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.</p>
<h2>Paxlovid</h2>
<p>In June 2022, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Paxlovid, nirmatrelvir, infringes a U.S. patent issued in June 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.</p>
<h2>Abrysvo</h2>
<p>In August 2023, GlaxoSmithKline Biologics SA and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (collectively, GSK Group) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Abrysvo infringes four U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and a permanent injunction against sales of Abrysvo for use in adults over 60 years of age. In November 2023, GSK Group amended its complaint to assert infringement of two additional patents. In addition, we have challenged certain of GSK's RSV vaccine patents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K., the Netherlands and Belgium, and GSK has asserted that Abrysvo infringes these patents.</p>
<h2>Matters Involving Pfizer and its Collaboration/Licensing Partners</h2>
<h2>Comirnaty</h2>
<p>In July 2022, Pfizer, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH filed a declaratory judgment complaint against CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a judgment of non-infringement for three U.S. patents relating to Comirnaty. In May 2023, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Also in May 2023, CureVac asserted that Comirnaty infringes the three patents that were the subject of our declaratory judgment complaint, and in May and July 2023, CureVac asserted that Comirnaty infringes a number of additional U.S. patents.</p>
<p>In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech have sued CureVac seeking a judgment of invalidity of several patents and CureVac has made certain infringement counterclaims.</p>
<h2>A2. Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation</h2>
<p>We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.</p>
<h2>Asbestos</h2>
<p>Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.</p>
<p>Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.</p>
<p>There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.</p>
<h2>Effexor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs' claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payor plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<h2>Lipitor</h2>
<p>Beginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Court's orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.</p>
<p>Also, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.</p>
<h2>EpiPen (Direct Purchaser)</h2>
<p>In February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizer's motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In October 2023, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation on terms not material to Pfizer. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<h2>Docetaxel</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Personal Injury Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.</p>
<p>In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Mississippi Attorney General Government Action</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product andeight other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.</p>
<h2>Zantac</h2>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson &amp; Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson &amp; Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants' Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs' expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, which has resulted in the dismissal of all complaints in the litigation. Plaintiffs have appealed the Federal MDL Court's rulings.</p>
<p>In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants' sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants' alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts. The large majority of the state court cases have been filed in the Superior Court of Delaware in New Castle County.</p>
<p>Many of these Zantac-related cases have been outstanding for a number of years and could take many more years to resolve. From time to time, Pfizer has explored and will continue to explore opportunistic settlements of these matters.</p>

<h2>Chantix</h2>
<p>Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer's voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.</p>
<h2>A3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters</h2>
<h2>Monsanto-Related Matters</h2>
<p>In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.</p>
<p>In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia's former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.</p>
<p>In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia's indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia's and New Monsanto's assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto's chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto's chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.</p>
<h2>Environmental Matters</h2>
<p>In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as Wyeth Holdings Corporation and American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have executed or have become a party to a number of administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and/or federal and state natural resource trustees to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and related environmental remediation activities, and to resolve alleged damages to natural resources, at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.</p>
<p>We are also party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.</p>
<h2>Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health</h2>
<p>In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs' claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals' decision. In February 2023, the Court of Appeals denied defendants' en banc petitions.</p>
<h2>Allergan Complaint for Indemnity</h2>
<p>In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.</p>
<h2>Viatris Securities Litigation</h2>
<p>In October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatris common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each company's current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. An amended complaint was filed in January 2023, and alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the Transactions, as well as related communications. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief. In November 2023, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation on terms not material to Pfizer. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<h2>Breach of Contract - Comirnaty</h2>
<p>In 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH initiated separate formal proceedings against the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Romania and Hungary in Belgium's Court of First Instance of Brussels. Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking an order from the Court holding those countries to their commitments for COVID-19 vaccine orders, which were placed as part of their contracts signed in 2021.</p>

<h2>A4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations</h2>
<p>We are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.</p>
<h2>Greenstone Investigations</h2>
<ul>
<li>· U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Since July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>· State Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation</li>
</ul>
<p>In April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated with a MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the MDL in July 2020. The MDL also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.</p>
<h2>Subpoena &amp; Civil Investigative Demand relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR</h2>
<p>In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We responded to that subpoena in full and have had no communication with the SDNY in connection with the subpoena since June 2019. Additionally, in September 2020, we received a Civil I nvestigative Demand (CID) f rom the Texas Attorney General's office seeking records of a similar nature to those requested by the SDNY. We produced records in response to this request. In November 2023, the investigation culminated in a qui tam litigation brought by the State of Texas. The investigation is now closed.</p>
<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies</h2>
<p>In February 2019, we received a CID from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We have produced records in response to these and subsequent requests.</p>

<p>In March 2023, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Mexico. We are producing records pursuant to this request.</p>
<h2>Government Inquiries relating to Xeljanz</h2>
<p>In April 2023, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia, in coordination with the Department of Justice's Commercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and information related to programs Pfizer sponsored in retail pharmacies relating to Xeljanz. We are producing records pursuant to this request.</p>
<h2>B. Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer. See Note 2C for a description of the March 2022 indemnity provided by Pfizer to GSK in connection with the issuance of notes by the Consumer Healthcare JV. In conjunction with the completion of GSK's demerger transactions in July 2022, GSK's guarantee and our related indemnification of GSK's guarantee were terminated.</p>
<p>In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.</p>
<p>See Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.'s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.</p>
<p>We have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. See Note 7D .</p>
<h2>C. Certain Commitments</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we had commitments totaling $5.2 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. These commitments include payments relating to potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur, and purchase obligations for goods and services.</p>
<p>See Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability.</p>
<h2>D. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions</h2>
<p>We may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D . The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2023 is $692 million, of which $179 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $512 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of December 31, 2022 was $645 million, of which $42 million was recorded in Other current liabilities and $603 million in Other noncurrent liabilities . The increase in the contingent consideration balance from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to fair value adjustments, partially offset by payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones.</p>
<h2>E. Insurance</h2>
<p>Our insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.</p>
<h2>Note 17. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information</h2>
<h2>A. Segment Information</h2>
<p>We regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. In 2023, we managed our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, an offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer's R&amp;D focus areas. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Beginning in July 2023, in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, we reorganized our R&amp;D platform operations. Discovery to late-phase clinical development for oncology is performed by a new end-to-end ORD organization and discovery to late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas is consolidated into the end-to-end PRD organization. ORD and PRD replace our former WRDM and GPD organizations, where, prior to July 2023, research units within WRDM were generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets and, prior to July 2023, GPD was generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early- and latestage clinical assets in Pfizer's pipeline. In 2023, Biopharma received R&amp;D services from</p>

<p>ORD, PRD and the predecessor WRDM and GPD organizations. These services included IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products.</p>
<p>Other Business Activities-Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>· ORD--the R&amp;D expenses managed by our ORD organization, which is responsible for discovery to late-phase clinical development for oncology research projects for our global Biopharma portfolio along with facilitating regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies for these projects. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights for oncology projects.</li>
<li>· PRD--the R&amp;D expenses managed by our PRD organization, which is responsible for discovery to late-phase clinical development research projects for all therapeutic areas other than oncology for our global Biopharma portfolio, along with facilitating regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies for these projects. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights related to non-oncology projects. The PRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to both ORD and PRD R&amp;D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which helps ensure that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payors and health authorities--with complete and upto-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer's medicines.</li>
<li>· Corporate and other unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others) and other corporate costs, including, but not limited to, all strategy, business development and portfolio management capabilities and certain compensation, as well as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead costs primarily associated with our manufacturing operations (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reconciling Items-The following items, transactions and events are not allocated to our operating segment results: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company, and which may also include purchase accounting impacts, such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such certain significant items can include, but are not limited to, pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, net gains and losses on investments in equity securities, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.</p>
<p>Segment Assets-We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $227 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $197 billion as of December 31, 2022.</p>

<h2>B. Geographic Information</h2>
<p>The following summarizes revenues by geographic area:</p>
<p>| | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |

| (MILLIONS) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |

| Total revenues | $ 58,496 | $ 100,330 | $ 81,288 |</p>
<p>Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 14, 24 and 21 countries outside the U.S. in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The U.S. is the only country to contribute more than10% of total revenue in 2023, 2022 and 2021. As a percentage of revenues, our largest country outside the U.S. was Japan, which contributed 6% of total revenue in 2023, 8% of total revenue in 2022 and 9% of total revenue in 2021.</p>
<h2>C. Other Revenue Information</h2>
<h2>Significant Customers</h2>
<p>We and our collaboration partner, BioNTech, have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty under such agreements. This includes supply agreements entered into in November 2020 and February and May 2021 with the EC for Comirnaty on behalf of the different EU member states and certain other countries. Each EU member state submits its own Comirnaty vaccine order to us and is responsible for payment pursuant to terms of the supply agreements negotiated by the EC. In May 2023, we and BioNTech amended our contract with the EC to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the EU. The amended agreement includes rephasing of delivery of doses annually through 2026 and an aggregate volume reduction, providing additional flexibility for those EU member states who agreed to the amended agreement. The EC will maintain access to future adapted COVID-19 vaccines and the ability to donate doses, in alignment with the original agreement.</p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, we had entered into agreements to supply pre-specified treatment courses of Paxlovid with government and government sponsored customers in multiple developed and emerging nations around the world, which represented most Paxlovid revenues in 2022 and 2023, while commercialization began in some markets in 2023. In October 2023, we announced an amended agreement with the U.S. government, which facilitated the transition of Paxlovid to traditional commercial markets starting in November 2023, with prices negotiated with commercial payors and a copay assistance program for eligible privately insured patients, as the U.S. government began to discontinue the distribution of EUAlabeled Paxlovid. We ensured commercial readiness by providing NDA-labeled commercial supply by the end of 2023. However, EUA-labeled Paxlovid remained available free-ofcharge to all eligible patients until the end of 2023, and therefore, there was only minimal uptake of NDA-labeled commercial product before January 1, 2024. In connection with this agreement, we recorded a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, of which a portion was associated with sales recorded in 2022, related to the expected return of an estimated 6.5 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled U.S. government inventory. We will convert these treatment courses previously purchased by the U.S. government to a volume-based credit, based on the actual number of treatment courses that are returned by the U.S. government, which will support continued access to Paxlovid through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by Pfizer. Therefore, we expect the patient assistance program will provide an estimated 6.5 million treatment courses of FDA-approved, NDA-labeled Paxlovid free of charge to all eligible uninsured, Medicare and Medicaid patients through 2024, and to eligible uninsured and underinsured patients through 2028. We also agreed to create, in 2024, a U.S. Strategic National Stockpile of 1.0 million treatment courses to enable future pandemic preparedness through 2028, which will be managed and supplied by Pfizer at no cost to the U.S. government or taxpayers. While we will recognize revenue as the estimated 7.5 million treatment courses are delivered, there is no remaining cash consideration for these treatment courses.</p>

<p>Remaining Performance Obligations-Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty and Paxlovid to our customers totaled approximately $6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of these amounts, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2024 through 2028, the timing of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year. Remaining performance obligations associated with contracts for other products and services were not significant as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.</p>
<p>Deferred Revenues-Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers for supply of Paxlovid and Comirnaty.</p>
<p>The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid totaled $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, with $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively, while deferred revenues related to Paxlovid were not material as of December 31, 2022. The increase in Paxlovid deferred revenues during 2023 was primarily driven by the reversal of Paxlovid revenues and conversion of previously purchased EUA-labeled Paxlovid treatment courses into a volume-based credit under our October 2023 amended agreement with the U.S. government.</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies</p>
<p>The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, with $1.1 billion and $552 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred revenues during 2023 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Product revenues as we delivered the products to our customers, partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. During 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $2.2 billion that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022.</p>
<p>The Paxlovid and Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2023 will be recognized in Product revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the products to our customers and satisfy our performance obligations under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Product revenues from December 2024 (which falls in our international first quarter of 2025) through 2028. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.</p>

<p>Disclosure Controls and Procedures</p>
<p>As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Controls</h2>
<p>On December 14, 2023, we acquired Seagen. Other than the addition of Seagen's operations to our internal control over financial reporting and any related changes in control to integrate Seagen into Pfizer, there has not been any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<h2>To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pfizer Inc.:</h2>
<h2>Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>We have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.</p>
<p>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of the Company's consolidated operations except for the operations of Seagen Inc. and its subsidiaries (Seagen), which the Company acquired on December 14, 2023. Seagen's operations represent 0.2% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, and assets associated with Seagen's operations represent 22% of the Company's consolidated total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Seagen.</p>
<h2>Basis for Opinion</h2>
<p>The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</p>
<p>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>

<h2>Management's Report</h2>
<p>We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in this Form 10-K. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of other financial information that is included in this document.</p>
<h2>Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of the Company's consolidated operations except for the operations of Seagen Inc. and its subsidiaries (Seagen), which the Company acquired on December 14, 2023. Seagen's operations represent 0.2% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, and assets associated with Seagen's operations represent 22% of the Company's consolidated total assets, as of December 31, 2023.</p>
