## Table of Contents

*   The regulatory approval processes in the U.S., in the E.U. and in other foreign jurisdictions are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for apraglutide or our other product candidates, our business will be harmed.

*   Delays in the completion of clinical testing of any of our products or product candidates could result in increased costs and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.

*   Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.

*   We must work effectively and collaboratively with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates) to market and sell LINZESS in the U.S., and must adapt our commercial model and market strategy to the evolving landscape for LINZESS to achieve its maximum commercial potential.

*   We face competition and new products may emerge that provide different or better alternatives for treatment of the conditions that our products are approved to treat.

*   Our products or product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their development, create unpredictable clinical trial results, impact its regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential.

*   Even though LINZESS is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in adult and certain pediatric patients, post-approval development and regulatory requirements still remain, which may present additional challenges.

*   If we are unable to execute on our strategy to in-license or acquire externally developed products or product candidates, or engage in other transactions with value creation potential, our business and prospects would be materially adversely affected.

*   We may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity, which may harm our business.

*   We may be unable to successfully partner with other companies to develop and commercialize products and/or product candidates, our ability to grow would be impaired and our business would be adversely affected.

*   We may be unable to successfully integrate the business and personnel of VectivBio and may not realize the expected benefits and anticipated synergies of such acquisition.

*   Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.

*   Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success.

*   Limitations on our ability to obtain patent protection and/or the patent rights relating to our products and our product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.

*   Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.

PART I
Item 1. Business
Our Company

We are a gastrointestinal, or GI, healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the
standard of care for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in
areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.

LINZESS® (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration, or U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists, or GC-C agonists, and is indicated
for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or
CIC, and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation, or FC. LINZESS is available to adult men
and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia, to adult men and women
suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C in China and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 with FC in the U.S.
Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in
Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.

We have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of
linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in the U.S. and all countries
worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates), or
AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, in Japan.

We also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional treatment
options to GI patients.

In June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding AG, or
VectivBio, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments for severe, rare GI
conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need, or the VectivBio Acquisition. In December 2023, we completed a
squeeze-out merger to acquire all remaining shares. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with $400.0 million of
borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 10, *Debt*, to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Through the acquisition, the Company is
advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, for rare gastrointestinal
diseases, including short bowel syndrome dependent on parenteral support, also known as SBS-IF, as well as several earlier stage
assets.

In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration Agreement,
with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that grants us an option to acquire an exclusive license to
research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing immune modifying
nanoparticle, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC.

We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as interstitial
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis.

We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and
commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates.

# Performance Against 2023 Core Priorities

In 2023, our GI-focused strategy, building on our commercial success and GI development capabilities, continued to focus on three core priorities: maximize LINZESS, strengthen and progress our innovative GI portfolio, and deliver sustained profits and generate cash flow.

## Maximize LINZESS

*   We recognized $430.5 million in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $31.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in LINZESS prescription demand, partially offset by inventory channel fluctuations.
*   In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.

## Strengthen and progress our innovative GI portfolio

*   We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of apraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In April 2023, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to apraglutide in SBS-IF. In October 2023, we presented positive final data from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity. We are also conducting open label extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential submissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and Japan.
*   We are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute Graft versus Host Disease, or aGvHD, a life-threatening condition that occurs when immune cells from the donor attack a recipient's healthy cells after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.
*   Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104. COUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.
*   We are developing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including IC/BPS and endometriosis. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy volunteers and are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.

## Deliver sustained profits and cash flow

*   In 2023, we recognized a net loss of approximately $1.0 billion, which included a non-recurring charge of approximately $1.1 billion for acquired in-process research and development in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition.
*   We generated $183.4 million in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, ending the year with $92.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Our Pipeline
The following table presents the status and anticipated near-term catalysts of selected key development programs in our
pipeline as of December 31, 2023:
Graphic
The status of our development programs in the table above represents the ongoing phase of development and does not
correspond to the completion of a particular phase. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status,
timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug
development efforts are discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Linaclotide
IBS-C and CIC are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of sufferers worldwide. As many as 11.5 million
adults suffer from IBS-C and as many as 28.5 million adults suffer from CIC in the U.S., based on Rome II criteria from the
Lieberman GI Patient Landscape Survey performed in 2010, or the Lieberman Survey. Symptoms of IBS-C include abdominal pain,
discomfort and/or bloating and constipation symptoms (e.g., incomplete evacuation, infrequent bowel movements, hard/lumpy
stools), while CIC is primarily characterized by constipation symptoms. Greater than 65% of IBS-C patients suffer from bloating
and/or discomfort at least one time per week, according to the Lieberman Survey.
Linaclotide-U.S. In August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women
suffering from IBS-C (290 mcg dose) or CIC (145 mcg dose). We and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in
December 2012. In January 2017, the U.S. FDA approved a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide for the treatment of adult men and women
with CIC.
We and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of linaclotide by studying linaclotide in additional
indications, populations, and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020, based on Phase IIIb
data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of LINZESS 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and
discomfort, in adult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to include a
more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label.
In addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand
the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based
on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of
serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and
contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18

years of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for
pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this
patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C
less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.

**Linaclotide-Global.** AbbVie has rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other than
China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan. CONSTELLA is the first, and to date, only drug approved in the European
Union, or E.U., for IBS-C. CONSTELLA first became commercially available in certain European countries beginning 2013. AbbVie
is commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain for adults with
IBS-C.

AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS.
CONSTELLA became commercially available in Canada in 2014 for adults with IBS-C or CIC. LINZESS became commercially
available in Mexico in 2014, and in Saudi Arabia in 2023, for adults with IBS-C or CIC.

Astellas has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. Astellas began commercializing
LINZESS in Japan for adults with IBS-C in 2017, and for adults with chronic constipation in 2018.

AstraZeneca has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
In 2019, AstraZeneca began commercializing LINZESS in China for adults with IBS-C.

**Apraglutide**

Through the VectivBio Acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, long-acting synthetic peptide analog
of GLP-2, as a potentially differentiated therapeutic for rare diseases, including SBS-IF and aGvHD.

SBS is a malabsorption disorder caused by the loss of functional small intestine, with symptoms that include diarrhea,
dehydration, malnutrition and weight loss. SBS typically occurs in adults as a consequence of irreparable GI damage caused by
physical trauma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ischemia or cancer requiring surgeries that result in the removal of large portions
of the small intestine or colon. In infants and children, SBS is typically a consequence of congenital defects or decreases in intestinal
absorptive capacity secondary to surgical procedures. The symptoms and severity of SBS can vary depending upon the length and
function of the remaining portion of the intestine. Patients suffer from SBS-IF when their gut function is reduced below the minimum
function necessary for the absorption of macronutrients or water and electrolytes required to survive and, in the case of infants and
children, to maintain health and growth.

We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of apraglutide in adult patients with
SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October 2023, we presented positive final data from the STARS
Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity. We are also conducting open label extension
studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential submissions of
marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and Japan.

We are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory
gastrointestinal aGvHD and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.

**CNP-104**

Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the potential treatment of PBC, a
rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver that affects approximately 130,000 people in the U.S., according to a study published in
Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2018. If successful, CNP-104 has the potential to be the first approved PBC disease
modifying therapy. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104. COUR is currently conducting a
clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline
data expected in the third quarter of 2024.

IW-3300
We are advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including IC/BPS and
endometriosis. IC/BPS affects an estimated 4 to 12 million Americans, according to the Interstitial Cystitis Association as of 2022.
An estimated 4 million reproductive-age women in the U.S. have diagnosed endometriosis, according to a study published in
Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation in 2017. Both diseases have a limited number of treatment options available. We
successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy volunteers and are continuing the
Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.
Collaborations and Partnerships
As part of our GI-focused strategy, we have established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to leverage as
we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and commercialization of our
products in the U.S., either independently or with partners that have strong capabilities. We also intend to establish strong global
brands by out-licensing development and commercialization rights to our products in other key territories to high-performing partners.
We plan to seek collaborations that increase the value of our products by providing meaningful economics and incentives for us and
any potential partner. We intend to continue to expand our expertise in GI by accessing innovative externally developed products and
to leverage our existing capabilities to develop and commercialize these products in the U.S.
We have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has allowed us to focus our commercialization
efforts in the U.S. and enabled partners with strong global capabilities to commercialize linaclotide in territories outside of the U.S.
The following chart shows our revenue for the U.S. and the rest of the world as a percentage of our total revenue for each of
the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

Revenue attributable to our linaclotide partnerships comprised substantially all of our revenue for each of the years indicated.
Further, we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. and
believe that the revenues from this collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the
foreseeable future. Our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. is highly dependent on the responsiveness
of patients to fill prescriptions and other factors such as retail chain and wholesaler buying patterns, pricing and reimbursement and
inventory channel levels. Our collaborative arrangements revenue may continue to fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of
royalties from sales of linaclotide in the markets in which it is currently approved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives
approval, as well as clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our strategic partnerships outside of the U.S.
Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie
In September 2007, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the
treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and AbbVie
are jointly and equally funding the development and commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S., with equal share of any profits or
losses. Additionally, we granted AbbVie exclusive rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Canada and Mexico for which
we receive royalties in the mid-teens percent on net sales in those countries. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development,
regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and funding any costs.

License Agreement with AbbVie (All countries other than the countries and territories of North America, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and Japan)

In April 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, or the European License Agreement, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe (including the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey) for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions. In January 2017, we and AbbVie entered into an amendment to the European License Agreement, to extend the license to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan, and the countries and territories of North America. We refer to the additional licensed countries as the Expanded Territory. Under the European License agreement, AbbVie is obligated to pay us (i) certain commercial milestones totaling up to $42.5 million, (ii) royalties based on sales volume in Europe, beginning in the mid-single digits percent and escalating to the upper-teens percent, and (iii) on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in the Expanded Territory, a royalty as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient in the upper-single digits for the first five years following the first commercial sale of a linaclotide product in a country, and in the low-double digits thereafter. The royalty rate for products in the Expanded Territory will decrease, on a country-by-country basis, to the lower-single digits, or cease entirely, following the occurrence of certain events.

License Agreement for Japan with Astellas

In November 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in Japan. On August 1, 2019, we and Astellas amended and restated the license agreement. Under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement, Astellas is obligated to pay royalties to us at rates beginning in the mid-single-digits percent and escalating to low-double-digits percent, based on aggregate annual net sales in Japan of products containing linaclotide API.

Collaboration Agreement for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), with AstraZeneca

In October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). In September 2019, we and AstraZeneca amended and restated the collaboration agreement, under which AstraZeneca obtained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing linaclotide in the territory. Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, we transferred all manufacturing responsibilities in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) to AstraZeneca, and we are entitled to receive non-contingent payments totaling $35.0 million in three installments through 2024, of which $15.0 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2023. In addition, AstraZeneca may be required to make milestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain sales targets and is required to pay tiered royalties to us at rates beginning in the mid-single-digits percent and increasing up to twenty percent based on the aggregate annual net sales of products containing linaclotide in the territory.

Collaboration and License Option Agreement with COUR

In November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement with COUR, pursuant to which we have been granted an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104. COUR has initiated a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.

Pursuant to the terms of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we made an upfront, non-refundable payment of $6.0 million to COUR during the year ended December 31, 2021, and agreed to pay a non-contingent payment and milestone payments to COUR totaling $13.5 million in connection with certain development activities and regulatory milestones. In April 2023, the Company and COUR executed an amendment to the COUR Collaboration Agreement, in which the Company agreed to pay a one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of $6.0 million to COUR in exchange for the right to apply a credit of $6.6 million against future amounts due to COUR in connection with the exercise of the Option, commercial milestones, or royalties. In connection with such payment, COUR also granted the Company a right of first negotiation over certain additional potential research and development programs.

After reviewing the data from the clinical study for CNP-104, if we exercise the option, we will pay COUR $28.4 million in exchange for the exclusive license. Upon commercialization, we will pay royalties to COUR in the high-single digits to low-double digits percentage of the aggregated annual net sales in the U.S. of products containing CNP-104, and COUR will be eligible to receive commercial milestone payments of up to $440.0 million over the term of the agreement.

Development and Commercialization Agreement with AKP

In March 2022, VectivBio entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation, or AKP, in which VectivBio granted an exclusive license to AKP, with the right to sublicense in multiple tiers, to develop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan.

Pursuant to the terms of the development and commercialization agreement with AKP, VectivBio received an upfront payment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement) and is eligible to receive development related payments of JPY 1,000 million ($8.2 million at date of agreement) and up to JPY 19,000 million ($155.8 million at date of agreement) of commercial and sales-based milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive payments in the commercial period for manufacturing supply equal to cost-plus manufacturing mark-up and tiered royalties of up to a mid-double-digit percentage on product sales continuing until the later of (i) expiration of regulatory exclusivity to apraglutide in Japan, or (ii) expiration of the last valid patent claim that provides exclusivity to apraglutide in Japan, or the Royalty Term. The development and commercialization agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the Royalty Term.

Our Strategy

Our vision is to become the leading GI healthcare company. To achieve this vision, we assembled a team with demonstrated success in creating, acquiring and partnering, developing, and commercializing medicines that can make a difference in patients’ lives. We are dedicated to leveraging our development and commercial expertise to advance the treatment of GI diseases and redefine the standard of care for patients suffering from GI diseases. Our strategy is focused on three core priorities: maximize LINZESS, advance our GI pipeline, and deliver sustained profits and cash flow.

Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximize LINZESS

*   Leveraging our U.S.-focused commercial capabilities in marketing, reimbursement, patient engagement, and sales to expand the commercial potential of LINZESS.
*   Exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations, and formulations.
*   Collaborating with global partners who share our vision, values, culture, and processes to develop and commercialize linaclotide outside of the U.S.

Advance GI pipeline

*   Advancing our GI pipeline programs, highlighted by apraglutide for the potential treatment of SBS-IF and CNP-104 for the potential treatment of PBC.
*   Evaluating strategic partnership options for our wholly owned GC-C agonist, IW-3300, for the potential treatment of IC/BPS and endometriosis.

Deliver sustained profits and cash flows

*   Executing our strategy by delivering sustainable profits and cash flows.
*   Applying a thoughtful and disciplined capital allocation strategy to deliver value for our shareholders over the long-term.

Competition

Linaclotide competes globally with certain branded and generic prescription therapies and over-the-counter, or OTC, products for the treatment of IBS-C and CIC, or their associated symptoms.

OTC laxatives make up the majority of the treatments in the U.S. for IBS-C and CIC, according to our research. LINZESS is the number one prescribed branded treatment in the U.S. for adults with IBS-C and CIC, according to 2023 data from IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit.

Until the launch of LINZESS, the only available branded prescription therapy for IBS-C and CIC in the U.S. was AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which was approved for the treatment of CIC in 2006, for the treatment of IBS-C in 2008, and for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in 2013. AMITIZA is being commercialized in the U.S. by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited, or Takeda. AMITIZA also is being commercialized for the treatment of adults with CIC in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland by Sucampo AG, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan by Mylan N.V. Authorized generic versions of AMITIZA became available in the U.S. since January 2021. TRULANCE® (plecanatide) was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in January 2017 and for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in January 2018 and is being commercialized in the U.S. by Bausch Health Companies, or Bausch. Shire plc obtained approval of MOTEGRITY™ (prucalopride) in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in December 2018. In April 2022, Ardelyx, Inc., or Ardelyx, launched IBSRELAX™ (tenapanor), a U.S. FDA approved treatment for IBS-C in adults, and in August 2022, Vibrant Gastro Inc. launched Vibrant, a drug-free capsule that the U.S. FDA granted marketing authorization for the treatment of CIC in adults who have not experienced relief of their bowel symptoms by using laxative therapies at the recommended dosage for at least one month. OTC laxatives such as MiraLAX® and DULCOLAX®, and lactulose, a prescription laxative treatment, are also available for the treatment of constipation.

In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future. For example, for apraglutide, we compete with companies that are commercializing or developing drugs such as GATTE® (teduglutide) in the U.S. and REVESTIVE® (teduglutide for injection) in Europe, and Zealand Pharma A/S, which is developing the GLP-2 analog glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS and which submitted an NDA to the U.S. FDA in December 2023. Hanmi Pharmaceutical is also developing a GLP-2 analog which is in Phase 2. Products with other mechanisms of action may emerge as future competition.

Manufacturing and Supply

Linaclotide

It is our objective that the supply of linaclotide be safe and effective, with redundancy built into critical steps of the supply chain, and that each of our collaboration partners are in a position to manage the supply and distribution of linaclotide in their respective territories through a combination of contract manufacturers and in-house manufacturing capabilities. Linaclotide production consists of three phases—manufacture of the API (sometimes referred to as drug substance), manufacture of finished drug product and manufacture of finished goods. We and/or our partners have commercial supply agreements with multiple third-party manufacturers for the production of linaclotide API. We believe the current commercial suppliers have the capabilities to produce linaclotide API in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, on a sufficient scale to meet the worldwide development and commercial needs for linaclotide. The commercial suppliers of linaclotide API are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies worldwide and also undergo periodic audit and certification by our partners’ or our own quality department.

Each of AbbVie, Astellas and AstraZeneca is responsible for linaclotide API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers in its respective territories.

Prior to linaclotide, there was no precedent for long-term room temperature shelf storage formulation for an orally dosed peptide to be produced in millions of capsules per year. Our efforts to date have led to formulations that are both cost effective and able to meet the stability requirements for commercial pharmaceutical products.

Apraglutide

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical, or, if approved, commercial quantities of apraglutide. We design and develop the manufacturing process for apraglutide together with contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs. We utilize these CDMOs for the manufacture of apraglutide for human use. Although we intend to rely on third-party CDMOs to produce apraglutide, we have personnel with experience managing third-party CDMOs producing apraglutide in clinical or commercial quantities.

Our clinical trials of apraglutide currently use the product in the form of a lyophilized powder in vial that is solubilized and reconstituted with a diluent prior to injection. We are also evaluating novel drug product presentations, with the goal of providing increased patient convenience and increased simplicity of the dosing and self-injection.

Sales and Marketing

For the foreseeable future, we intend to develop and commercialize our drugs in the U.S. alone or with partners, and expect to rely on partners to develop and commercialize our drugs in territories outside the U.S. In executing our strategy, our goal is to retain oversight over the worldwide development and commercialization of our products by playing an active role in their commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, culture and processes.

To date, we have established a high-quality commercial organization dedicated to supporting our vision of becoming the leading GI healthcare company. Our GI commercial capabilities, including marketing, patient engagement and sales, are designed to support our existing product as well as potential future internally and externally developed products.

We are also coordinating efforts with our linaclotide partners to launch and maintain an integrated, global linaclotide brand. By leveraging the knowledge base and expertise of our experienced commercial team and the insights of each of our linaclotide commercialization partners, we continually improve our collective marketing strategies.

We are currently in the process of planning for the commercial launch of apraglutide, if successfully developed and approved, for commercialization in the U.S. and with partners in territories outside the U.S. For example, we granted AKP an exclusive license to sublicense, develop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan. We are considering potential partnerships in other territories outside the U.S.

Patents and Proprietary Rights

We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing patents that cover our products, compositions, formulations, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; defend our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. We expect to apply, and have applied, for patent term extension in countries where it is available.

Linaclotide Patent Portfolio

After the recent expiration of a number of patents in our linaclotide patent portfolio, our linaclotide patent portfolio is currently composed of 11 patents in the U.S., including 7 U.S. patents listed in the U.S. FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, six granted European patents, most of which have been validated in available European countries, ten granted Japanese patents, three granted Chinese patents, 49 issued patents in other foreign jurisdictions, and numerous pending U.S., foreign and Patent Cooperation

Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. We and our partners own, either jointly or individually, all of the issued patents and pending applications.

The issued, unexpired U.S. patents, which will expire between 2026 and 2033, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, processes for making the molecule, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and methods of use thereof. The 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS doses are covered by composition of matter patent in the U.S., which expires in 2026. In addition, the commercial formulations of the unexpired European patents, which will expire between 2027 and 2036, some of which have received patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, uses of linaclotide to prepare medicaments for treating GI disorders, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and their use in treating IBS-C and chronic constipation. The granted, unexpired Japanese patents, which will expire between 2026 and 2034, some of which are subject to granted and potential patent term extension, and the granted patents in other foreign jurisdictions, which will expire between 2029 and 2032, some of which may be subject to patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions of linaclotide for use in treating GI disorders and delayed release and other potential formulations of linaclotide.

We have pending patent applications in certain countries worldwide that, if issued, will expire between 2029 and 2044 and which include claims covering the linaclotide molecule, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, the current commercial formulations of linaclotide and their use to treat GI disorders and delayed release and other potential formulations of linaclotide.

The patent term of a patent that covers a U.S. FDA approved drug is also eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for some of the patent term lost during the U.S. FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of a single patent applicable to an approved drug for up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but the extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval by the U.S. FDA. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a Certificate of Patent Term Extension for U.S. Patent 7,304,036, which covers linaclotide and methods of use thereof. As a result, the patent term of this patent was extended to August 30, 2026, 14 years from the date of linaclotide’s approval by the U.S. FDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have received patent term extensions in Japan for several of our linaclotide patents. We have also received patent term extensions, called supplementary protection certificates, for certain linaclotide patents from several national patent offices in Europe.

We and AbbVie received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, submitted to the U.S. FDA by five generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of LINZESS. All five manufacturers requested approval for their 145 mcg and 290 mcg generic doses of LINZESS and two requested additional approval for their 72 mcg generic doses of LINZESS. We and AbbVie have entered into settlement agreements with all five of these generic drug manufacturers providing for licenses to market their 72 mcg (if applicable),145 mcg and 290 mcg generic versions of LINZESS, beginning as early as March 2029 (subject to U.S. FDA Approval), unless certain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur.

Apraglutide Patent Portfolio

Our apraglutide patent portfolio includes a patent family which we exclusively license that is composed of one issued U.S. patent and 56 foreign patents. This patent family contains composition-of-matter claims covering apraglutide and methods of treatment using apraglutide. The patents in this patent family that we exclusively license outside of the U.S. are issued in Europe, including Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, regulatory patent term extensions or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid timely, the patents in this patent family are expected to expire in 2030.

Our apraglutide portfolio also includes two wholly owned patent families. The first patent family includes one granted U.S. patent and five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, as well as 27 pending foreign patent

applications related to apraglutide. The granted U.S. patent in this patent family claims a method of treating SBS, and the pending U.S. and foreign patent applications contain composition-of-matter claims to ultrapure compositions of apraglutide, methods of manufacturing apraglutide, and methods of treatment using apraglutide. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, regulatory patent term extension or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid timely, the U.S. patent, as well as patents granted from the pending U.S and foreign patent applications, would be expected to expire in 2041.

The second patent family which we wholly own includes two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 13 pending foreign patent applications related to methods of treating GvHD using apraglutide. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, regulatory patent term extension or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid timely, any U.S. and foreign patents granted from the pending patent applications would be expected to expire in 2042.

Government Regulation

Our business is subject to government regulation in the U.S., E.U., and in other countries. The U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other regulatory authorities have very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and civil or criminal prosecution.

U.S. FDA Approval Process

In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, as well as similar foreign regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-marketing requirements and assessments, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.

No company may market a new drug in the U.S. until it has submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. FDA, and the U.S. FDA has approved it. The steps required before the U.S. FDA may approve an NDA generally include:

*   conducting non-clinical laboratory tests and animal tests in compliance with U.S. FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;

*   design of a clinical protocol and submission to the U.S. FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trial may begin;

*   approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;

*   development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current GMP;

*   conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s), in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP;

*   preparation and submission to the U.S. FDA of an NDA;

*   review of the NDA by a U.S. FDA advisory committee, where applicable;

*   satisfactory completion of one or more U.S. FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current GMP.

Table of Contents

*   satisfactory completion of any U.S. FDA inspections of non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP and GCP requirements; and

*   U.S. FDA review and approval of the NDA, which may be subject to post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the U.S. FDA.

Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the non-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. We must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the U.S. FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials in the U.S. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the U.S. FDA, unless the U.S. FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trial. In such a case, we must work with the U.S. FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the U.S. FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that will cause us or the U.S. FDA to modify, suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB requirements or if the trial has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. For studies conducted outside of the U.S., similarly, we are subject to local regulations which may differ from the U.S. and local regulations must be followed appropriately.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed or trained by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:

*   evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;

*   determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase III trials; and

*   identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

Phase III trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with GCP regulations and guidance, and regulations designed to protect the rights and safety of subjects involved in investigations.

The U.S. FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.

The results of the non-clinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the U.S. FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. The U.S. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all requirements and required data, the U.S. FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The review process, however, may be extended by U.S. FDA requests for additional information, non-clinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a REMS. The U.S. FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The U.S. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but

it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the U.S. FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless current GMP compliance is satisfactory. The U.S. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The U.S. FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or information. The U.S. FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post marketing testing and surveillance, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain U.S. FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulties in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidates. Failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect commercialization and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.

Hatch-Waxman Act

The Hatch-Waxman Act established abbreviated approval procedures for generic drugs. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA with the U.S. FDA. The application for a generic drug is “abbreviated” because it need not include non-clinical or clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and may instead rely on the U.S. FDA’s previous finding that the brand drug, or reference drug, is safe and effective. In order to obtain approval of an ANDA, an applicant must, among other things, establish that its product is bioequivalent to an existing approved drug and that it has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, and route of administration. A generic drug is considered bioequivalent to its reference drug if testing demonstrates that the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference drug when administered under similar experimental conditions.

The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, certain legal protections from generic competition. This protection comes in the form of a non-patent exclusivity period, during which the U.S. FDA may not accept, or approve, an application for a generic drug, whether the application for such drug is submitted through an ANDA or a through another form of application, known as a 505(b)(2) application.

The Hatch-Waxman Act grants five years of exclusivity when a company develops and gains NDA approval of a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved by the U.S. FDA. This exclusivity provides that the U.S. FDA may not accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for five years after the date of approval of previously approved drug, or four years in the case of a 505(b)(2) application that challenges a patent claiming the reference drug (see discussion below regarding Paragraph IV Certifications). The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for approved applications for drugs that are not new chemical entities, if the application contains the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application. Examples of applications that may require new clinical investigations essential to approval and receive three-year exclusivity include applications for new indications, dosage forms (including new drug delivery systems), strengths, or conditions of use for an already approved product. This three-year exclusivity period only protects against U.S. FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for generic drugs that do not include such conditions of approval (for example, indication or dosage form) that required new clinical investigations that were essential to approval; it does not prohibit the U.S. FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic drugs that do not include such conditions of approval.

Paragraph IV Certifications. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, NDA applicants and NDA holders must provide information about certain patents claiming their drugs, or methods of use of the drug that is the subject of the NDA, for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a “Paragraph IV” certification. A certification that provides the date a listed patent will expire, but does not challenge the validity,

enforceability or infringement of the patent, is called a “Paragraph III” certification. FDA can approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing the Paragraph III certification upon expiration of the patent.

Within 20 days of the acceptance by the U.S. FDA of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must notify the NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent holder may then initiate a patent infringement suit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30-month stay of the U.S. FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The U.S. FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay only if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, and the court may shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay under certain limited circumstances.

Patent Term Extension. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development and U.S. FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is extended if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term extension period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of patent term extension is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. Only one unexpired patent claiming the drug product, a method of using the product or a method of manufacturing the product is eligible for extension, and the patent holder must apply for extension within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the U.S. FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity

Orphan drug designation in the U.S. is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the U.S., a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the U.S.

Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first U.S. FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the U.S. FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent product candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, the U.S. FDA cannot approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor, or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.

Regulation of Drug-Device Combination Products in the U.S.

Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the U.S. FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the U.S. FDA. These products are known as drug-device combination products. Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the U.S. FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a drug-device combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the drug-device combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the U.S. FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the drug-device combination product. The U.S. FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the U.S. FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of drug-device combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

## Table of Contents

A drug-device combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug component generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for such a product, however, U.S. FDA reviewers could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. Approval may require the performance of certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors studies to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component of the combination product. In addition, under U.S. FDA regulations, drug-device combination products are subject to current GMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System Regulations applicable to medical devices.

### Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements

After approval, finished drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the U.S. FDA, which includes company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with current GMP, maintain and provide to the U.S. FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain U.S. FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with U.S. FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and U.S. FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties and, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.

We and our partners and any third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage are required to comply with applicable U.S. FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the U.S. FDA’s current GMP regulations. Current GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet current GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the U.S. FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.

With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the U.S. FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting drugs for uses, conditions or diseases, or in patient populations that are not consistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and principles governing industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with U.S. FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters from the U.S. FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or patients, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and U.S. FDA approval of a new NDA or sNDA before the change can be implemented. An sNDA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar in type and quality to the clinical data supporting the original application for the original indication, and the U.S. FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing such sNDAs as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following U.S. FDA approval of an NDA. The U.S. FDA also may require post marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS, and surveillance studies to monitor the effects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that restrict the distribution or use of the product.

Outside the U.S., our and our collaborators’ abilities to market a product are contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U. registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state. We are subject to U.S. federal and foreign anti-corruption laws. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign

government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad.
The scope of the FCPA encompasses certain healthcare professionals in many countries. We are also subject to similar laws of other
countries that have enacted anti-corruption laws and regulations.
EU Marketing Approval of Medicinal Products
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company also must comply with numerous and varying regulatory
requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical
trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Regardless of whether or not it obtains U.S. FDA
approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary marketing approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory
authorities before it can initiate clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, there are a
number of similarities between the process regarding regulatory approval of medicinal products in the European Economic Area, or
EEA, and that in the U.S. Marketing approval requires satisfactory completion of pharmaceutical development, non-clinical studies
and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed
indication. It also requires the submission to relevant competent authorities for a clinical trial authorization to be granted and to the
EMA, or to competent authorities in E.U. Member States for granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the
product can be marketed and sold in the E.U.
Clinical Trial Approval. Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the E.U. are subject to
significant regulatory controls. Certain preclinical (also termed "non-clinical") data is required in order to inform the scientific basis
for clinical trials to be conducted and later for such data to be used in the dossier for supporting a marketing authorization application,
or MAA. Preclinical data are required to guide the clinical development, from Phase I (first-in-human clinical trials) through to
Phases II and III, to establish the safety and efficacy of a medicinal product. During all phases of clinical development, national
competent authorities of E.U. Member States and other comparable regulatory authorities require extensive monitoring and auditing
of all clinical trial related activities, to ensure safety of the trial participants, and quality and integrity of trial data.
In the E.U., clinical trials are governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (E.U.) No. 536/2014, or CTR, which entered into
application on January 31, 2022, replacing Directive 2001/20/EC or CTD. The CTR is intended to harmonize and streamline clinical
trial authorizations, simplify adverse-event reporting procedures, improve the supervision of clinical trials and increase their
transparency. Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from competent authorities of
E.U. Member States in which the sponsor intends on carrying out clinical trials, and a positive opinion from an independent Ethics
Committee. The CTR, which is directly applicable in all E.U. Member States, introduces a streamlined application procedure through
a single-entry point, the "E.U. portal", the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS. Since January 31, 2023, the use of CTIS has
become mandatory for all clinical trial sponsors submitting initial applications for the approval of their clinical trials in the E.U. The
CTR also establishes a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application including, among other things, a copy
of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the
medicinal product under investigation as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
Ongoing clinical trials authorized under CTD with at least one active site in the E.U. on January 30, 2025 must be
transitioned to CTR. Active site in the context of transitioning means that the last visit of the last subject, or the other trial-related
interventions with the subject specified in the protocol will take place after January 30, 2025. Clinical Trials with no active sites
authorized under CTD do not need to be transitioned even if the global trial is still ongoing outside the E.U. after the transition
deadline.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the E.U. must be conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices
requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements, including those foreseen in the Good Clinical Practice Directive
2005/28/EC, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Studies should also be conducted in
accordance with all applicable EMA, European Commission and national guidelines. Medicinal products used in clinical trials must
be manufactured in accordance with the guidelines on current GMP, and in a GMP compliant facility, which can be subject to GMP
inspections.
Marketing Authorization. To obtain a marketing authorization to market a medicinal product in the EEA, an applicant must
submit an MAA, either in accordance with a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of
20

## Table of Contents

the procedures administered by competent authorities in E.U. Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the E.U.

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission that is valid in all E.U. Member States and through the EEA Member States – Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including those (i) derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) that are classified as advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, and (iv) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and diabetes, the centralized procedure is optional. For medicinal products containing a new active substance in the interest of patients, authorization through the centralized procedure is optional for product approval.

Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, conducts the scientific assessment of a medicinal product in respect of its safety, quality and efficacy for the purpose of determining its approvability.

Under the centralized procedure in the EEA, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops. Procedural clock-stops provide the applicant with the time to gather additional information in response to the outstanding questions raised by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment may be accepted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is considered to be of major interest from the viewpoint of public health, and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days. The CHMP can, however, revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

A marketing authorization granted under the E.U. regulatory system is valid for five years. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the Member State in which the original MA was granted. To support the application, the MA holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the electronic Common Technical Document providing up-to-date data concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, including all variations introduced since the MA was granted, at least nine months before the MA ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance to proceed with one further five-year renewal period for the MA. Thereafter, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the E.U. market (for a centralized MA) or on the market of the authorizing E.U. Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).

Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicinal products that target unmet medical needs. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the E.U. or, if there is, the new medicinal product will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted.

Combination Products. As in the U.S., the regulation of combination drug-device products depends in large part on which component has the primary mode of action.

Where a medical device incorporates a medicinal product as an integral part as a single use drug delivery system, it is regulated as a medicinal product in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC. In this case, the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements, or GSPRs of the MDR will apply to the safety and performance of the drug delivery device component.

Orphan Medicinal Product Designation and Exclusivity. Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in ten thousand persons in the E.U. when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the E.U.; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the E.U. or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.

In the E.U., an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of the MAA. Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a sponsor to incentives such as fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized MA procedure. Upon grant of an MA, provided that the orphan designation is maintained following a satisfactory review assessment by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the EMA of the criteria, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that the EMA cannot accept another MAA, or accept an application to extend an MA for a similar product for the same orphan indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products provided that the results of all studies conducted in compliance with an agreed PIP are provided – even though the results do not lead to an approval of a pediatric indication, but the results of the studies conducted are reflected in the summary of product characteristics and, if appropriate, in the package leaflet of the medicinal product concerned. Orphan medicinal product designation does not confer any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

The period of market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria on the basis of which it received orphan medicinal product designation, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period if: (i) if the applicant consents to a second original orphan medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period if: (i) if the applicant is unable to supply sufficient quantities; or (ii) if the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the register of orphan products.

Post-Approval Requirements. Where an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EEA, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products.

Similar to the U.S., both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EEA countries. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint a qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.

All new MAAs must include a risk management plan describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.

In the E.U., the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both E.U. and E.U. Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under E.U. law, the implementing rules in each member state may differ from one country to another. In addition, the statutory control regime could be supplemented by the voluntary control of advertising of medicinal products by self-regulatory bodies.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

International Regulation

In addition to regulations in the U.S. and the E.U., we could become subject to a variety of other foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market our product candidates in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain U.S. FDA or EMA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies greatly from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain U.S. FDA or EMA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Pricing and Reimbursement

Within the U.S., significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the U.S. FDA. Sales of our product, and any future products which obtain marketing approval, depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug or biologic typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the U.S. FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or to restrict coverage of our products could reduce utilization of our products. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a finished drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or to provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs and biologics have been a focus in this cost-containment effort. Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost- containment programs, including restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of new or enhanced cost-containment measures could limit our net revenue and results. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Restrictions in coverage or decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs, and public scrutiny of drug pricing. There have been and likely will continue to be health care reform efforts. For example, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate programs effective January 1, 2024. As another example, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, of 2022, contains various drug pricing and payment provisions. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare Parts B and D. In addition, the IRA requires Medicare to negotiate Medicare prices for certain high-cost drugs and biologicals, including both physician-administered products covered under Medicare Part B benefit and self-administered drugs covered under Medicare Part D benefit. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually selects a specified number of negotiation-eligible drugs from those drugs with the highest total Medicare Part B or D expenditures over a preceding 12-month period. Eligible drugs generally include single source brand-name drugs or biological products that

Sales and Marketing

The marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S.

Within the U.S., numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such activities, including the U.S. FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, state departments of health and state pharmacy boards.

We are subject to the requirements of the FDCA and accompanying regulations that prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting a drug prior to approval from the U.S. FDA and from promoting an approved drug in a manner inconsistent with the approved label.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products or product candidates that may in the future receive marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or, in some cases, private third-party payors. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and therefore may not be regulations or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions and/or require reporting of pricing information or marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.

Data Privacy and Security Laws

Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional

reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle
allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
In addition to federal regulation, many states have begun to focus on efforts to regulate privacy and data security. For
example, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was expanded
by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, collectively establishes a
privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy
rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a
new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security
procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act also applies to
pharmaceutical companies, including requirements for written authorization to use and disclose medical information and restrictions
on the circumstances under which medical information can be used for marketing purposes. Other states that have also recently
enacted comprehensive data privacy and security laws, include Washington, Utah, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut. Furthermore,
all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories have enacted data breach notification laws. These various
state laws differ from one another and impose significant compliance efforts.
EEA Member States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and
regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal
data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR,
together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EEA Member States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland
governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer
personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions
concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of
personal data out of the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, data breach notifications, security and confidentiality, responding
and handling data subject rights, ensuring appropriate assessments are carried out on processing operations and documented. Under
these laws, data protection authorities can impose substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European
data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to
the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA, United Kingdom or Switzerland. Guidance on implementation and
compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2023, we had 267 employees. Of these employees, 72 were on our drug development team, 133 were on
our sales and commercial team, and 62 were in general and administrative functions. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)
Creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture is essential to attracting, motivating and retaining the talent necessary to
deliver on our corporate mission. To establish and maintain this culture, we have a simple vision in mind: to make Ironwood an
environment rooted in valuing each employee for who they are.
This begins with ensuring our workforce represents the diverse populations we serve and reflecting our DE&I principles in
our employee-related trainings and policies. Women represent approximately 50% of our employee base, 20% of our leadership team
(vice president and above) and 33% of our board of directors (including our board and audit committee chairs). Additionally,
approximately 20% of our employees are racially or ethnically diverse and in 2023, approximately 40% of our new hires were racially
or ethnically diverse (excluding Europe-based employees, for which race and ethnicity is not disclosed).
We are focused on fostering an environment where employees feel included and empowered. This approach includes DE&I
initiatives such as learning and development opportunities, strengthened talent acquisition strategies, and the support of equality
programs in our local communities. We are also proud to have three strong and growing employee resource groups: W@IRWD
(Women at Ironwood), ISTAR (Ironwood Stands Together Against Racism), and PRIDE.

In 2023, we continued to advance our DE&I initiatives with strong advocacy from our leadership team and board of directors. We incorporated DE&I metrics into our corporate goals. Over the course of the year, we achieved our target level of performance on these metrics.

Compensation and Benefits

All our employees receive equity and are encouraged to think and act as owners of Ironwood. We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and to create incentives to attract, motivate and retain our employees. We are focused on pay equity and regularly monitor our pay practices among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization.

Communication and Engagement

We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to our ability to execute on our vision, mission and strategy. Our communication and engagement efforts seek to offset competitive talent challenges in the biopharmaceutical industry and employees’ higher expectations of their employers. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including frequent town hall meetings, Ironwood intranet, CEO blog, leadership engagement opportunities, regular communications regarding business updates, and employee engagement surveys.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock may decline due to these risks.

Risks Related to LINZESS, Apraglutide and Other Product Candidates

We are highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS (linaclotide) in the U.S. for the foreseeable future.

We and our partner, AbbVie, began selling LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Revenues from our LINZESS collaboration constitute a significant portion of our total revenue, and we believe they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The commercial success of LINZESS depends on a number of factors, including:

*   the effectiveness of LINZESS as a treatment for adult patients with IBS-C, or CIC, and as a treatment for pediatric patients aged 6-17 years-old with FC;
*   the size of the treatable patient population;
*   the effectiveness of the sales, managed markets and marketing efforts by us and AbbVie, includingour ability to adapt our commercial model and market strategy to the evolving landscape;
*   the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;
*   the adoption of LINZESS by physicians, which depends on whether physicians view it as safe andeffective treatment for adult patients with IBS-C and CIC and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC;

## Table of Contents

*   our success in educating and activating adult IBS-C and CIC patients, and children and adolescents ages 6-17 years-old FC patients and their caregivers, to seek physician care for their symptoms;

*   our ability to both secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for, and optimize patient access to, LINZESS and our ability to demonstrate that LINZESS is safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies;

*   the effectiveness of our partners’ distribution networks;

*   the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in theseor other areas, associated with linaclotide; and

*   the development or commercialization of products or therapies that compete with LINZESS.

Our revenues from the commercialization of LINZESS are subject to these and other factors, and therefore may be unpredictable from quarter-to-quarter.

**We are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies in the U.S. which, if not favorable for our products, could hinder or prevent our products’ commercial success.**

Our and our partner’s ability to commercialize our products successfully depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what level, we expect that third-party payors will consider factors that include the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of our products, as well as the availability of other treatments including generic prescription drugs and OTC alternatives. Further, in order to obtain and maintain acceptable reimbursement levels and access for patients at copay levels that are reasonable and customary, we have offered, and expect to continue to face increasing pressure to offer, discounts or rebates from list prices or discounts to third-party payors or other unfavorable pricing modifications. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time consuming and expensive process, and there is no guarantee that we or AbbVie, with respect to linaclotide in the U.S., will be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate pricing terms with third-party payors at levels that are profitable to us, or at all. Certain third-party payors also require prior authorization for, or even refuse to provide, reimbursement for our products, and others may do so in the future. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we and our partners are not able to receive approval for reimbursement of our products from third-party payors on a broad, timely or satisfactory basis; if reimbursement is not maintained at satisfactory levels or becomes subject to prior authorization. In addition, our business could be adversely affected if government healthcare programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursement bodies or payors limit or reduce the indications for or conditions under which our products may be reimbursed. Moreover, as discussed further below, changes in insurance coverage or reimbursement policies by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors, or in the type of such coverage held by patients may materially harm our business and commercialization efforts.

We may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to the healthcare reforms discussed below, as well as the trend toward initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs, the increasing influence of managed care, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. There has been significant scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and the resulting costs of pharmaceutical products and the pharmaceutical industry. There have been a number of federal and state efforts to address drug costs or limiting drug prices, price increases or other related costs. Certain of these efforts have resulted in legislative and regulatory reforms. For example, and as discussed further below, the IRA, which could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and increasing the discounts we provide for our products and product candidates. As another example, legislation enacted in 2021 revised the Medicaid drug rebate program in which we and other manufacturers participate so that Medicaid rebates were no longer capped at 100% of the quarterly average manufacturer price, or AMP. We anticipate that our ability to increase prices on our products, including LINZESS, and our revenues, may be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory reforms such as the Medicaid drug rebate program revisions.

Healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results.

We and our linaclotide partners are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies outside the U.S., as well as risks relating to the improper importation of linaclotide and sale of counterfeit versions of linaclotide. If such policies are not favorable, or if linaclotide is improperly imported or is counterfeited, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.

In some foreign countries, particularly Canada, the countries of Europe, Japan and China, the pricing and payment of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 6 to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. Reimbursement sources are different in each country, and each country may include a combination of distinct potential payors, including private insurance and governmental payors. Some countries may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and control the price of medicinal products for human use. To obtain favorable pricing and reimbursement sought or pricing approval in some countries, we and our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost and clinical effectiveness of linaclotide to other available therapies. Further, several countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. Many third-party payors and governmental authorities also consider the price for which the same product is being sold in other countries to determine their own pricing and reimbursement strategy, so if linaclotide is priced low or gets limited reimbursement in a particular country, this could result in similarly low pricing and reimbursement in other countries in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at or reduced to unsatisfactory levels, our and our partners’ ability to successfully commercialize linaclotide in such country would be impacted negatively. Furthermore, if these measures prevent us or any of our partners from selling linaclotide on a profitable basis in a particular country, they could prevent the commercial launch or continued sale of linaclotide in that country.

CONSTELLA was first launched in certain European countries for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013 and our partner, AbbVie, is currently commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries. LINZESS was first launched in Japan for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in the first quarter of 2017, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in the third quarter of 2018, and our partner Astellas is currently commercializing LINZESS in Japan. In addition, LINZESS was first launched in China for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in November 2019, and our partner AstraZeneca, is currently commercializing LINZESS in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). The pricing and reimbursement strategy is a key component of our partners’ commercialization plans for CONSTELLA in Europe and LINZESS in Japan and China. Our revenues may suffer if our partners are unable to successfully and timely conclude reimbursement, price approval or funding processes and market CONSTELLA or LINZESS in key member states of the E.U. or LINZESS in Japan or China, or if coverage and reimbursement for either CONSTELLA or LINZESS is limited or reduced. If our partners are not able to obtain or maintain coverage, pricing or reimbursement on acceptable terms or at all, or if such terms change in any countries in its territory, our partners may not be able to, or may decide not to, sell either CONSTELLA or LINZESS in such countries.

We and our partners also face the risk that linaclotide is imported or reimported into markets with relatively higher prices from markets with relatively lower prices, which would result in a decrease of sales and any payments we receive from the affected market. Additionally, third parties may illegally produce, distribute and/or sell counterfeit or otherwise unfit or adulterated versions of linaclotide. In either case, we and our partners may not be able to detect or, if detected, prevent or prohibit the sale of such products, which could result in dangerous health consequences for patients, loss of confidence in us, our partners and our products, and adverse regulatory or legal consequences. Any of the foregoing or other consequences could adversely impact our reputation, financial results and business.

We cannot give any assurance that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials, and if successful, will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before it can be commercialized.

Upon the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition, we added apraglutide, VectivBio’s lead investigational asset, a next generation, long-acting GLP-2 analog in development for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF and aGvHD, to our pipeline.

Apraglutide will require extensive clinical development, management of nonclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval, adequate manufacturing supply, and if approved, fully integrating apraglutide into the commercial infrastructure to support the appropriate sales, marketing, and market access efforts to generate sales in pursuit of revenue. We have not yet completed a pivotal trial for this product candidate. We are not permitted to market or promote this product candidate before we receive regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, the EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the applicable jurisdiction, and we may never receive any such regulatory approval for apraglutide. To obtain regulatory approvals for apraglutide, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. However, we cannot be certain that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials. Further, results from clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and apraglutide may not receive regulatory approval even if we believe it is successful in clinical trials. Even if we do receive regulatory approval for apraglutide for the treatment of additional indications, which would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.

The regulatory approval processes in the U.S., in the E.U. and in other foreign jurisdictions are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for apraglutide or our other product candidates, our business will be harmed.

The time required to obtain regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors. In addition, regulatory approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain regulatory approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Regulatory approval is never guaranteed. Data obtained from nonclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulatory authorities may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may further delay, limit or prevent development efforts, clinical trials, or regulatory approval. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are sufficient to support approval, such data may not be considered sufficient to support approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. Accordingly, it is possible that we will never obtain regulatory approval for apraglutide or our other product candidates.

The U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of our product candidates, including apraglutide, for many reasons, including the following:

*   the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;
*   the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety or efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval;
*   the data collected from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of a NDA, MMA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S., Europe or elsewhere;
*   participants in our clinical trials or individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates may experience serious and unexpected drug-related side effects;
*   we may be unable to demonstrate to the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate’s risk-to-benefit ratio for its proposed indications is acceptable;
*   the U.S. FDA, EMA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may disagree regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of a product candidate;
*   the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the

## Table of Contents

*   the regulatory approval policies or regulations of the U.S. FDA, EMA, or other applicable comparable foreign regulations in the E.U. and other jurisdictions may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.

In addition, apraglutide may be also regulated as a drug and device combination product by the U.S. FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Developing and obtaining regulatory approval for combination products can pose unique challenges because they involve components that are regulated under different types of regulatory requirements and potentially by different U.S. FDA centers or regulatory authorities. As a result, combination product candidates may raise regulatory, policy and review challenges. Differences in regulatory pathways for each component of a combination product can impact the regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including clinical investigations, manufacturing and quality control, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, user fees and post-approval modifications. Although the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities have systems in place for the review and approval of combination products, we may experience additional delays in the development and commercialization of apraglutide due to regulatory timing constraints and uncertainties in the product development and approval process. Moreover, although we expect that the device component would be reviewed in connection with the review of the drug marketing application for apraglutide, if and when submitted, and that no separate marketing authorization or certification will be required, the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities may disagree and require that we obtain a separate marketing authorization or certification for the device component, which could further delay or prevent regulatory approval of apraglutide.

This lengthy regulatory approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to potentially market apraglutide or our other product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.

**Delays in the completion of clinical testing of any of our products or product candidates could result in increased costs and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.**

Delays in the completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs and timing of data readouts and potential approvals. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:

*   obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial;
*   reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;
*   manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;
*   obtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;
*   recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical programs for the treatment of similar conditions; and
*   maintaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up.

Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need or otherwise determine to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Each protocol amendment would require institutional review board or ethics committee review and approval, which may adversely impact the costs, timing or successful completion of the associated clinical trials. If we or our partners terminate or experience delays in the completion of any clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our products or product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval.

Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability
to grow and/or adversely affect our business.
As part of our growth strategy, we intend to explore further linaclotide development opportunities as well as to advance the
development of our other pipeline programs through internal or external opportunities.
We and AbbVie are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide
in new or existing indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. For example, we and
AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of
LINZESS in pediatric patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages
6-17 years-old with FC. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing. These development efforts may fail or
may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS. Furthermore, they may result in adverse events, or perceived adverse
events, in certain patient populations that are then attributed to the currently approved patient population, which may result in adverse
regulatory action at the U.S. FDA or in other countries or harm linaclotide's reputation in the marketplace, each of which could
materially harm our revenues from linaclotide.
The strength of our company's pipeline will depend in large part on the outcomes of studies of assets in our pipeline, such as
apraglutide, CNP-104, IW-3300, and any other assets that we may acquire or license from third parties. Through the VectivBio
Acquisition we added apraglutide to our pipeline. We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and
efficacy of apraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October 2023, we
presented positive final data from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity.
We are also conducting open label extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF
and to support potential submissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and Japan. We
are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory
gastrointestinal aGvHD, and expect data in the first quarter of 2024. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are
developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC. COUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024. We are
also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as IC/BPS, and endometriosis.
We may spend several years and make significant investments in developing any current or future product candidate, and
failure may occur at any point. Our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be
approved for sale by the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities. To satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources
among development programs and we must engage in costly and lengthy research and development efforts, which are subject to
unanticipated delays and other significant uncertainties. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other
improvement over existing competitive drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical trials, or meet applicable regulatory standards.
It is possible that none of the product candidates we develop will be approved for commercial sale, which would impair our ability to
grow.
We have ongoing or planned nonclinical and clinical trials, including for linaclotide, apraglutide, and our other product
candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after achieving
promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical trials. Findings from completed nonclinical studies may not be replicated in later
clinical trials, and clinical trials may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of
regulatory approval. Results from clinical trials and findings from nonclinical studies could lead to abrupt changes in development
activities, including the possible limitation or cessation of development activities associated with a particular product candidate or
program. We cannot be certain that apraglutide or our other product candidates will be successful in clinical trials. Furthermore, our
analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by the U.S. FDA, EMA
and other applicable regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The U.S. FDA, EMA or other
regulatory authorities also may require additional clinical trials, which may be costly or delay, limit, prevent or otherwise impact
regulatory submission or approval. Satisfaction of U.S. FDA, EMA or other applicable regulatory requirements is costly, time-
consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. We cannot give any assurance that apraglutide or our other product
candidates will receive regulatory approval. Even if we do receive such regulatory approval, we may be unable to successfully
commercialize apraglutide or our other product candidates in any approved

indications or develop such product candidates for the treatment of additional indications, which would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.

The pricing of apraglutide and our other product candidates, if and when approved for marketing, will depend in part on pricing and reimbursement strategies adopted by our competitors.

The pricing of apraglutide and our other product candidates, if and when approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the pricing and reimbursement strategies adopted by our competitors. For example, with respect to apraglutide, a marketed GLP-2 product already exists in the U.S., E.U. and other international markets, which may or may not be genericized within the coming years. Additionally, another investigational GLP-2 may be launched in advance of the potential approval of apraglutide in the U.S. and EMA. Order of market entry and reimbursement decisions could place apraglutide at a competitive disadvantage, possibly deny market exclusivity rights, and/or elevate the need for significant clinical differentiation to support certain pricing decisions. If these or other factors impact the price we can charge for apraglutide, we may reduce our revenue and results of operations could be affected. Similar competitive factors could apply to pricing and reimbursement decisions for our other product candidates, if approved, in the future.

We must work effectively and collaboratively with AbbVie to market and sell LINZESS in the U.S., and we must adapt our commercial model and market strategy to the evolving landscape for LINZESS to achieve its maximum commercial potential.

We are working closely with AbbVie to execute our joint commercialization plan for LINZESS. The commercialization plan includes an agreed upon marketing campaign that targets the physicians who see patients who could benefit from LINZESS treatment. Our consumer marketing campaign targets the adult men and women who suffer from IBS-C or CIC. Our commercialization plan also includes an integrated call plan for our sales forces in an effort to optimize the education of key healthcare professionals on whom our and AbbVie’s sales representatives call, and the frequency with which the representatives meet with them.

In order to optimize the commercial potential of LINZESS, we and AbbVie must execute upon this commercialization plan effectively and efficiently. In addition, we and AbbVie must continually assess, modify and adapt our commercialization plan in a coordinated and integrated fashion, including evaluating and adjusting as necessary the level and mix of marketing and promotion efforts, in response to changing business, market or other factors in order to advance the commercial potential of LINZESS, such as the U.S. FDA approval of LINZESS in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old for FC. Further, we and AbbVie must continue to focus our combined sales and marketing efforts on educating customers about the relevant data and information for LINZESS in treating adults with IBS-C and CIC, and taking a measured approach to educating and raising awareness on the FC indication for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. We and AbbVie must ensure a highly targeted and efficient promotional mix combined with providing our sales forces with the highest quality support, guidance, and oversight for them to continue effectively promoting LINZESS to key healthcare professionals. If we and AbbVie fail to evolve with the changing commercial landscape successfully and perform these commercial functions in the highest quality manner and in accordance with our joint commercialization plan and related agreements, LINZESS will not achieve its maximum commercial potential and we may suffer financial harm. Our commercial efforts to further target and engage adult patients with IBS-C or CIC may not effectively increase appropriate patient awareness or patient/physician dialogue and may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS.

We face competition and new products may emerge that provide different or better alternatives for treatment of the conditions that our products are approved to treat.

The pharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products or product candidates and the acquisition of rights to new products with other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors and enable them to compete more effectively. Competition may also increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Additionally, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.

Linaclotide competes with certain prescription therapies and OTC products, some of which have attained significant levels of market acceptance. The availability of prescription competitors and OTC products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for LINZESS unless we are able to maintain market acceptance among the medical community and patients and differentiate LINZESS on the basis of its cost and/or actual or perceived benefits. For example, Takeda’s AMITIZA (lubiprostone) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and opioid-induced constipation; TRULANCE (plecanatide) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBS-C and CIC; Takeda’s MOTEGITY (prucalopride) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults; in April 2022, Ardelyx launched in the U.S. IBSRELA™ (tenapanor), a U.S. FDA-approved treatment for IBS-C in adults; and in August 2022, Vibrant Gastro Inc. launched Vibrant, a drug-free capsule that the U.S. FDA granted marketing authorization for the treatment of CIC in adults who have not experienced relief of their bowel symptoms by using laxative therapies at the recommended dosage for at least one month. OTC laxatives such as MiraLAX® and DULCOLAX®, and lactulose, a prescription laxative treatment, are also available for the treatment of constipation. Additionally, we believe other companies are developing products that could compete with linaclotide. In addition, there are other compounds in late-stage development and other potential competitors that are in earlier stages of development that, if approved, may compete with linaclotide. If our current or potential competitors are successful in completing drug development for their drug candidates and obtain approval from the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, they could limit the demand for linaclotide. In addition to competition from such prescription and over-the-counter products, we may also face competition from multiple low-cost generic versions of such products when available in the U.S. For example, an authorized generic version of AMITIZA was first launched in the U.S. in January of 2021 and multiple versions are now available. We expect additional generic versions to become available in the future.

In addition, any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future. Apraglutide, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with companies that are commercializing or developing drugs for SBS, such as Takeda, which currently distributes the GLP-2 analog teduglutide, marketed as GATTEX® (teduglutide) in the U.S. and REVESTIVE® (teduglutide for injection) in Europe, and Zealand Pharma A/S, which is developing the GLP-2 analog glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS and which submitted an NDA to the U.S. FDA in December 2023. Hanmi Pharmaceutical is also developing a GLP-2 analog which is in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Products with other mechanisms of action may emerge as future competition.

Our products or product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their development, create unpredictable clinical trial results, impact its regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential.

Undesirable side effects caused by our products or product candidates, including adverse events associated with our product candidates, could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Additionally, with respect to our approved products, as patient experience increases and expands, or if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we, our partners, or others may later identify previously unknown side effects. Known side effects may be found to be more frequent and/or severe than in the past, or detect unexpected safety signals for products or any products perceived to be similar to our products. The foregoing, or the perception of the foregoing, may have the following effects, among others:

*   sales of our products may be impaired;
*   regulatory approvals for our products may be delayed, denied, restricted or withdrawn;
*   we or our partners may decide to, or be required to, change the products’ labeling or send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists or hospitals;
*   reformulation of the products, additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling or changes to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required;

*   we or our partners may be precluded from pursuing approval of our products in new territories or from studying additional development opportunities to enhance our products’ clinical profiles, including within new or existing indications, populations or formulations, as well as in potential combination products;

*   we may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan, or similar actions in other jurisdictions which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers or other elements to assure safe use;

*   our or our products’ reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and

*   government investigations or lawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us or our partners.

Any of the above occurrences could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, if they are approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects, prevent sales of our products, increase expenses and impair our and our partners’ ability to successfully commercialize our products.

Linaclotide has been prescribed to millions of patients since its launch in the U.S. and other territories beginning in December 2012. The number and type of patients treated with linaclotide could continue to grow if more physicians prescribe linaclotide to more patients and as we and our partners conduct clinical trials, including in new indications, populations or formulations, as well as explore potential combination products and in existing and new territories. As the patient experience with linaclotide increases and expands, we and others may identify previously unknown side effects, known side effects may be found to be more frequent or severe than in the past, and others may detect unexpected safety signals for linaclotide or any product perceived to be similar to linaclotide. The most commonly reported adverse reaction since linaclotide became commercially available, as well as in the clinical trials for linaclotide in IBS-C and CIC, has been diarrhea. In the linaclotide Phase III IBS-C and CIC trials in adults, severe diarrhea was reported in 2% or less of the linaclotide-treated patients and its incidence was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations. In the linaclotide Phase III FC trial in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old, severe diarrhea was reported in one linaclotide-treated patient.

In addition, the U.S. FDA-approved labeling for LINZESS contains a boxed warning describing the risk of serious dehydration in pediatric patients less than two years of age and a contraindication against its use in these patients. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. These and other restrictions could limit the commercial potential of LINZESS. We and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-market plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing. There can be no assurances, whether there may be any significant unknown side effects that could limit the commercial potential of LINZESS in this pediatric population.

Patients treated with apraglutide may experience well known class-specific adverse events, including, but not limited to, abdominal pain, injection site reactions, nausea, headaches, abdominal distension, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting and fluid overload. There may be additional mechanistic side effects that only reveal themselves upon the completion of larger studies. Additionally, apraglutide has been designed to have a long half-life, creating uncertainty about its long-term safety profile. For example, the increased pleiotropic activity of apraglutide will need to be assessed in longer-term non-clinical safety studies.

Even though LINZESS is approved by the U.S. FDA for use in adult and certain pediatric patients, post-approval development and
regulatory requirements still remain, which may present additional challenges, and we may not be successful in obtaining
approval for additional indications for LINZESS that we are seeking or may seek in the future.

In August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-
C or CIC. Although we and AbbVie completed additional nonclinical and clinical studies in adults that were required by the U.S. FDA
in connection with the approval of LINZESS, LINZESS remains subject to ongoing
U.S. FDA requirements, including those governing the testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion,
sale, distribution, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information.

The U.S. FDA-approved labeling for LINZESS contains a boxed warning describing the risk of serious dehydration in
pediatric patients less than two years of age and a contraindication against its use in these patients. We and AbbVie have established a
nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric
patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC,
making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness
of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established.
Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing in support of post-approval requirements. Our ability to expand
the indication or labeling information for LINZESS will depend on, among other things, our successful completion of pediatric
clinical programs.

These post-approval requirements impose resource and cost burdens on us. Failure to effectively, appropriately and timely
conduct and complete the required studies relating to our products, monitor and report adverse events and meet our other post-
approval commitments would lead to negative regulatory action at the U.S. FDA, which could include withdrawal of regulatory
approval of our products for their currently approved indications and patient populations.

Even though linaclotide is approved for marketing in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, we or our partners may never
receive approval to commercialize linaclotide in additional parts of the world.

In order to market any products outside of the countries where linaclotide is currently approved, we or our partners must
comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding, among other things, safety and efficacy.
Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and
greater than, those in the U.S. and the other countries where linaclotide is approved. Potential risks include that the regulatory
authorities:

*   may not deem linaclotide safe and effective;

*   may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to supportapproval;

*   may not approve of manufacturing processes and facilities;

*   may not approve linaclotide for any or all indications or patient populations for which approval issought;

*   may require significant warnings or restrictions on use to the product labeling for linaclotide;or

*   may change their approval policies or adopt newregulations.

If any of the foregoing were to occur, our or our partners' receipt of regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction could
be delayed or we or our partners may never receive approval at all. Further, regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure
regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on
the regulatory processes in others. If linaclotide is not approved for all indications or patient populations or with the labeling
requested, this would limit the uses of linaclotide and have an adverse effect on its commercial potential or require costly post-
marketing studies.

Risks Related to Our Growth Strategy

If we are unable to execute on our strategy to in-license or acquire externally developed products or product candidates, or engage in other transactions with value creation potential, our business and prospects would be materially adversely affected.

Our future success is largely dependent on our ability to successfully execute on our growth strategy, which includes in-licensing or otherwise acquiring the rights to externally developed gastrointestinal products or product candidates or engaging in other transactions with value creation potential. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising assets, platforms or other opportunities. For example, through the VectivBio Acquisition, we added apraglutide to our pipeline. There is no assurance that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials, and if successful, that it will receive regulatory approval. For another example, through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC, and we have been granted an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing CNP-104 in the U.S. for the treatment of PBC after reviewing the data from this study. There is no assurance that we will exercise the option for CNP-104, and if exercised, that we will complete subsequent clinical trials and receive regulatory approval.

In addition, the process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition is lengthy and complex and there is no assurance we will be able to enter into similar transactions in the future. Pursuit of external opportunities is also a highly competitive area and a number of other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, development, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for license or acquisition opportunities. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, product candidates, businesses or technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we expect that opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. If we are unable to successfully acquire the rights to additional products or product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all, or execute other value creating transactions, we will remain smaller, less diversified and highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS, and our business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, such in-licenses, acquisitions or other transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:

*   development, regulatory and commercialization challenges;
*   exposure to unknown liabilities;
*   disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to developacquired products, product candidates, businesses or technologies;
*   incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;
*   higher than expected acquisition and integrationcosts;
*   difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operationsand personnel;
*   increased amortization expenses;
*   impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and
*   inability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.

The development of product candidates in particular is a highly uncertain process, as we discuss further below. Any product candidate that we in-license or acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. We may also rely on our licensors and collaboration partners to conduct development activities for certain of our product

candidates, and while we may have oversight of such development activities, such licensees or collaboration partners may not effectively develop any such product candidates. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities or competitors may develop alternatives that render our potential product candidates obsolete or less attractive. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may in-license or acquire will be approved for commercial sale or be otherwise commercially viable, which would impair our ability to grow. Furthermore, we may have little or no insight or control over the development and commercialization of any product that we in-license outside the licensed territory. If other licensees do not effectively develop or commercialize any such product outside the licensed territory, our reputation or the reputation of any such product may be impacted.

We may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity, which may harm our business.

In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first U.S. FDA approval for the orphan indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the U.S. FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a company to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of data and market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, including biological medicinal products. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, the medicinal product is shown to no longer fulfills the orphan designation criteria, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Because the extent and scope of patent protection for our products may in some cases be limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our product candidates for which orphan drug designation may be available. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug product candidates that does not have a broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity and our revenue will be reduced.

Even though we have orphan drug designation for apraglutide in the U.S. and in the E.U., we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Based on available preclinical and clinical data, both the U.D. FDA and the EMA have granted apraglutide orphan drug designation for the treatment of SBS. The U.S. FDA also granted orphan drug designation for apraglutide for the prevention of aGvHD. Orphan drug applicability will be reassessed by health authorities upon completion of clinical studies and submission of our marketing application. In the E.U., the orphan drug designation for apraglutide may not be maintained at the time of grant of the marketing authorization if the EMA and COMP do not consider that there is sufficient confirmatory evidence to support that the criteria orphan designation continue to be met.

Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the U.S. FDA or European Commission can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the U.S. FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.

If we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to develop and commercialize products and/or product candidates, our ability to grow would be impaired and our business would be adversely affected.

As part of our business strategy, we may partner with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or other companies to develop and commercialize products or product candidates. Although we have entered into such arrangements with respect to the development and commercialization of linaclotide worldwide and of apraglutide in Japan, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future with respect to other products or product candidates that we either

develop internally or in- license or that we will be able to gain the interest of potential partners; establish and maintain development, manufacturing, marketing, sales or distribution relationships on acceptable terms; that such relationships, if established, will be successful or on favorable terms; or that we will gain market acceptance for such products or product candidates. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a partnership arrangement is lengthy and complex. If we enter into any partnering arrangements with third parties, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties. If we are unable to establish successful partnering arrangements when advantageous, we may not gain access to the financial resources and industry experience necessary to develop, commercialize or successfully market our products or product candidates, may be forced to curtail, delay or stop a development program, reduce the scope of our planned sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense, and therefore may be unable to generate revenue from products or product candidates or do so to their full potential.

Risks Related to the VectivBio Acquisition

We may be unable to successfully integrate the business and personnel of VectivBio, and may not realize the expected benefits and anticipated synergies of such acquisition.

In December 2023, we completed the VectivBio Acquisition. We may not realize the expected benefits from such acquisition because of integration difficulties or other challenges.

The success of the VectivBio Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the expected benefits from the acquisition and anticipated synergies from integrating its business with our existing business. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming and we may not ultimately realize the return on our investment. Risks we may face in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition include, among others:

*   failure to successfully implement our business plans for the combined business, including the development of apraglutide for SBS-IF;

*   failure of the VectivBio Acquisition to further our business strategy as we expected, including the development and, if approved, the commercialization of apraglutide for SBS-IF;

*   unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers, and the complexities associated with integrating personnel from another company;

*   unanticipated issues in conforming VectivBio's standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;

*   coordinating product candidate and process development;

*   increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;

*   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;

*   adverse effects on our or VectivBio's existing business relationships;

*   unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

*   unanticipated expenses and liabilities associated with the VectivBio Acquisition; and

*   other difficulties in the assimilation of VectivBio operations, technologies, product candidates and systems.

We may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation.

If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the business of VectivBio deteriorates, the anticipated benefits, cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the VectivBio Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors or analysts, and our stock price may decline as a result.

### Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties

Because we work with partners to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide, we and our partners are dependent upon third parties, and our and our partners’ relationships with those third parties, in our and our partners’ efforts to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, linaclotide, as well as to comply with regulatory and other obligations with respect to linaclotide.

AbbVie played a significant role in the conduct of the clinical trials for linaclotide and in the subsequent collection and analysis of data, and AbbVie holds the new drug application, or NDA, for LINZESS. AbbVie also continues to play a significant role in the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in the U.S. with AbbVie. AbbVie is also responsible for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in countries worldwide other than Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Astellas is commercializing LINZESS in Mexico, and Saudi Arabia and CONSTELLA in Canada as well as in certain countries including in Europe. Astellas and AstraZeneca are responsible for development and commercialization of LINZESS in Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau), respectively. Each of our partners for linaclotide also is responsible for active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers. We and/or our partners have commercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture the linaclotide API.

The integration of our efforts with our partners’ efforts is subject to the uncertainty of the marketsfor pharmaceutical products in each partner’s respective territories, and accordingly, these relationships must evolve to meet any new challenges that arise in those regions. These integrated functions may not be carried out effectively and efficiently if we fail to communicate and coordinate with our linaclotide partners, and vice versa. Our linaclotide partnering strategy imposes obligations, risks and operational requirements on us as the central node in our global network of partners. If we do not effectively communicate with each partner and ensure that the entire network is making integrated and cohesive decisions focused on the global brand for linaclotide, linaclotide will not achieve its maximum commercial potential. Further, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that our partners devote to linaclotide. If any of our partners fails to devote sufficient time and resources to linaclotide, or if its performance is substandard or otherwise hindered, it will delay the potential submission or approval of regulatory applications for linaclotide, as well as the manufacturing and commercialization of linaclotide in the particular territory. A material breach by any of our partners of our collaboration or license agreement with such partner, or a significant disagreement between us and a partner, could also delay the regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide, potentially lead to costly litigation, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Moreover, although we have non-compete restrictions in place with each of our linaclotide partners, they may have competitive products or relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If any of our partners competes with us or assists our competitors, it could harm our competitive position.

In addition, adverse event reporting requires significant coordination with our partners and third parties. We are the holder of the global safety database for linaclotide responsible for coordinating the safety surveillance and adverse event reporting efforts worldwide with respect to linaclotide; each of Astellas, AstraZeneca and AbbVie is responsible for reporting adverse event information from its territory to us. If we fail to perform such activities and maintain the global safety database for linaclotide or if our partners do not report adverse events related to linaclotide, or fail to do so in a timely manner, we may not receive the information that we or our partners are required to report to the U.S. FDA or a foreign regulatory authority regarding such products. Furthermore, we or our partners may fail to adequately monitor, identify or investigate adverse events, or to report adverse events to the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authority accurately and within the prescribed timeframe. If we or our partners are unsuccessful in any of the foregoing due to poor process, execution, systems, oversight, communication, adjudication or otherwise, then we may suffer any number of consequences, including the imposition of additional restrictions on the use of linaclotide, removal of linaclotide from the market, criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of such products, or delay in approval of future products.

We rely entirely on contract manufacturers, our partners and other third parties to manufacture linaclotide, apraglutide, and our other product candidates and to distribute linaclotide. If they are unable to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, experience manufacturing or distribution difficulties, or are otherwise unable to source sufficient raw materials, experience manufacturing or distribution difficulties, or are otherwise unable to source sufficient raw materials, experience manufacturing or distribution difficulties, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.

We have no internal manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Instead, we rely on a combination of contract manufacturers and our partners to manufacture API, finished drug product and finished goods for linaclotide, apraglutide, and our other product candidates. For linaclotide, each of our partners is responsible for API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers. We and/or our partners have commercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture linaclotide API. For apraglutide, we design and develop the manufacturing process together with CDMOs for the manufacture for human use. Should we, or any of our partners or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take the following actions, among others:

*   issue warning letters or untitled letters;
*   impose civil or criminal penalties;
*   suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;
*   suspend any ongoing clinical trials;
*   refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us or our partners;
*   impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or
*   seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.

Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other regulatory requirements. We have little control over compliance with these regulations and standards by our partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage.

In addition, we expect that apraglutide may be regulated by the U.S. FDA as a drug-device combination product. Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with GMP regulations applicable to drug-device combination products, including applicable provisions of the U.S. FDA’s drug GMP regulations and device GMP requirements embodied in the Quality System Regulation, or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S.

Our partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage may experience problems with their respective manufacturing and distribution operations and processes, including, for example, quality issues, such as product specification and stability failures, procedural deviations, contamination, natural disasters and public health epidemics. In addition, the raw materials necessary to make API for our products and product candidates are acquired from a limited number of sources. Any delay or disruption in

the availability of raw materials or a change in raw material suppliers could result in production disruptions, delays or higher costs with consequent adverse effects on us.

The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations and the challenges associated with complex supply chain management. Even if our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage do not experience problems and commercial manufacturing is achieved, their maximum or available manufacturing capacities may be insufficient to meet commercial demand. Finding alternative manufacturers or adding additional manufacturers requires a significant amount of time and involves significant expense. New manufacturers would need to develop and implement the necessary production techniques and processes, which along with their facilities would need to be inspected and approved by the regulatory authorities in each applicable territory.

If our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage fail to adhere to applicable GMP or other regulatory requirements, experience manufacturing or distribution problems, we will suffer significant consequences, including product seizures or recalls, loss of product approval, fines and sanctions, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these results, or if maximum or available manufacturing capacities are insufficient to meet demand, our and our partners’ development or commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.

If any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control or in management, this may adversely affect our collaborative relationship or the success of the commercialization of linaclotide in the U.S. or in the other countries where it is approved, or the ability to achieve regulatory approval, launch and commercialize linaclotide in other territories.

We work jointly and collaboratively with partners on many aspects of the development, manufacturing and/or commercialization of linaclotide. In doing so, we have established relationships with several key members of the management teams of our linaclotide partners in functional areas such as development, quality, regulatory, drug safety operations, marketing, sales, field operations and medical science. Further, the success of our collaborations is highly dependent on the resources, efforts and skills of our partners and their key employees. As we and our partners develop linaclotide in the U.S. and the other countries where it is approved, and develop, launch and commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world, the drug’s success becomes more dependent on us maintaining highly collaborative and well aligned partnerships. In May 2020, AbbVie announced the completion of its acquisition of Allergan plc. Our collaboration, now with AbbVie, for the development and commercialization of linaclotide in North America, and our license, now to AbbVie, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, remain in effect. In connection with this transaction, we continue to engage with AbbVie to reestablish relationships and confirm alignment, including on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide. Any failure to do so could adversely affect the development and commercialization of linaclotide. If any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control or in management, we would similarly need to reestablish many relationships and confirm alignment, including on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide. Further, in connection with any change of control or change in management, there is inherent uncertainty and disruption in operations, which could result in distraction, inefficiencies, and misalignment of priorities. As a result, in the event of a change of control or in management at one of our linaclotide partners, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully execute on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide in an effective and efficient manner and without disruption or reduced performance. Finally, any change of control or in management may result in a reprioritization of linaclotide within a partner’s portfolio, or such partner may fail to maintain the financial or other resources necessary to continue supporting its portion of the development, manufacturing or commercialization of linaclotide.

If any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control and the acquirer either (i) is unable to perform such partner’s obligations under its collaboration or license agreement with us or (ii) does not comply with the divestiture or certain other provisions of the applicable agreement, we have the right to terminate the collaboration or license agreement and reacquire that partner’s rights with respect to linaclotide. If we elect to exercise these rights in such circumstances, we will need to either establish the capability to develop, manufacture and commercialize

Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Matters

We face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims brought against us are successful, we could incur substantial liabilities.

The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of our approved products, including the sale of linaclotide, expose us to product liability claims. If we do not successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:

*   decreased demand for approved products;
*   impairment of our business reputation;
*   withdrawal of clinical trial participants;
*   initiation of investigations by regulators;
*   litigation costs;
*   distraction of management's attention from our primary business;
*   substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;
*   loss of revenues; and
*   the inability to commercialize our product candidates.

We currently have product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates which is subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses associated with claims. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.

We will incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting any "off-label" uses of our products.

Physicians are permitted to prescribe drug products and medical devices for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those approved by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Such "off-label" uses are common across medical specialties. Although the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate

a physician's choice of treatments, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do restrict manufacturer communications on off-label use. Companies are not permitted to promote drugs or medical devices for off-label uses or to promote unapproved drugs or medical devices. Accordingly, we do not permit promotion of any product that we develop, license, commercialize, promote, co-promote or otherwise partner prior to approval or for any indication, population or use not described in or consistent with such product's labeling. The U.S. FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have promoted off-label uses or have engaged in improper pre-approval promotion will be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. Even if it is later determined that we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.

Notwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional disease awareness and scientific exchange concerning their products and therapeutic areas of interest. We intend to engage in disease awareness and scientific exchange and education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Although we believe we have put in place a robust compliance program, which is designed to ensure that all such activities are performed in a legal and compliant manner, we cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely eliminated.

**If we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.**

The marketing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products and related arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, patients and other third parties in the healthcare industry are subject to a wide range of healthcare laws and regulations within the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Within the U.S., federal laws and regulations include:

*   federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing or ordering of, a good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;

*   federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to manufacturers for reasons including providing coding and billing advice to customers or engaging in prohibited off-label promotional activities;

*   federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers with whom we interact and health plans with which we may interact;

*   the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;

*   the 21st Century Cures Act, which amends Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to define healthcare economic information and the circumstances under which healthcare economic information may be disseminated;

*   federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturersto report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to

government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; and

*   the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, certain non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and

There are also state law equivalents of certain of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts, which laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the healthcare industry, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances.

Other laws and regulations have also been enacted by various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require manufacturers to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.

Outside the U.S., our activities may be subject to healthcare laws. For example, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the E.U. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of E.U. Member States, and by Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.

Payments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States must be publicly disclosed, and in the United Kingdom a public consultation on the introduction of equivalent transparency requirements is currently underway. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual E.U. Member States and the United Kingdom. These requirements are provided in the national laws, self-regulatory industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the E.U. Member States and the United Kingdom. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.

We also are subject to the FCPA which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity, related to any ex-U.S. activities, as well as other similar anti-bribery laws in any other country in which we may do business.

We are subject to stringent and changing U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; disruptions of our operating results and business; and other adverse business consequences.

We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions, both inside and outside the U.S., in which we operate and/or obtain or store personally identifiable information, such as the E.U. GDPR, the United Kingdom’s GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, or FADP. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, applies to the processing of personal data in the EEA. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, by certain companies that process data in relation to (i) offering goods or services to, or (ii) monitoring the behavior of, individuals located in the EEA. As such, we would be subject to the GDPR for data processing associated,

for example, with conducting clinical trials in the EEA or entering into research collaborations in the EEA. The GDPR imposes stringent obligations for processing of personal data, such as setting high standards for consent, requiring the provision of detailed processing notices, facilitating the exercise of data subject rights and requiring reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as establishing standards for how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The FADP also applies to the collection and processing of personal data by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of Switzerland. The FADP has been revised and adopted by the Swiss Parliament and took effect on September 1, 2023. The revisions to the FADP may result in increased costs of compliance, and risks of noncompliance and penalties.

The GDPR, United Kingdom’s GDPR and FADP also increase the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, respectively (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission, United Kingdom or Switzerland, respectively, to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. In July 2020 the Court of Justice of the E.U. (CJEU) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. The framework has been replaced by the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework for which the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in July 2023. While we do not currently rely upon this framework, we expect there to be legal challenges to this framework in the future, which could draw into question the legitimacy of other cross-border transfer mechanism, including the standard contractual clauses on which we rely to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. and other jurisdictions. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms or where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, we could incur additional compliance costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations and, if we are unable to otherwise transfer personal data among jurisdictions in which we operate, our services and geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations could be affected.

In addition, in the U.S., we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023 (the CPRA, together with CCPA, the California Privacy Law). The California Privacy Law gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights regarding personal information collected about them; including the collection, use, selling or sharing (as defined in the California Privacy Law) of personal information collected from or about California consumers.

The compliance obligations imposed by the GDPR, United Kingdom’s GDPR, FADP, the California Privacy Law, and other applicable privacy laws, have required us to revise our operations. Breaches of applicable data protection requirements may result in substantial fines and other regulatory penalties, as well as confer a private right of action on data subjects (in the case of the GDPR, UK GDPR and FADP) and their representatives for breaches of certain data protection requirements. We expect to be subject to additional privacy laws at both the U.S. state level and abroad as many jurisdictions either recently have data privacy legislation or are considering enacting such legislation to which we may become subject. Achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable international, federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove time-consuming and costly.

If our operations, or the operations of third parties upon which we rely, are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. For example, under the GDPR and the United Kingdom’s GDPR, penalties for noncompliance could be up to 20 million Euros or 4% of our total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, rules or regulations, we cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the requirements in this space are constantly evolving. Any action against us for violation of these laws, rules or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, as well as damage our business or reputation.

Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success.

The U.S. government and individual states have been aggressively pursuing healthcare reform designed to impact delivery of, and/or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives intended to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which, among other things, expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate; included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs; imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded drugs; and expanded government enforcement authority.

Beyond the ACA, there have been ongoing legislative and administrative and other health care reform efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. Some healthcare reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products or the healthcare industry more generally. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, under the Biden Administration, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, under the Biden Administration, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug prices in Medicare Parts B and D. In addition, the IRA requires Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost drugs and biologicals, including both physician-administered and self-administered drugs covered under the Medicare Part B benefit and self-administered drugs covered under the Medicare Part D benefit. CMS annually selects eligible drugs from those drugs with the highest total Medicare Part B or D expenditures over a preceding 12-month period. Eligible drugs generally include single source brand-name drugs or biological products that have been on the market without therapeutically-equivalent generic or biosimilar alternatives for a specified number of years with certain exceptions (e.g., orphan drugs indicated for only one rare disease or condition and drugs with less than $200 million in annual Medicare expenditures). CMS will publish the negotiated price, known as the MFP for each of the selected products. Manufacturers of selected drugs would be required to offer the drug for Medicare recipients at the MFP. Manufacturers who fail to negotiate or offer the MFP for those drugs will take effect in 2026. Only Medicare Part D drugs are selected for the first two years of the program (i.e., MFPs that take effect in 2026 and 2027). Depending on the share of Medicare spending each year that is attributed to LINZESS or any other product candidate that we develop and whether or not those drugs become eligible for Medicare negotiation, those drugs and our revenue may be adversely impacted by this provision.

Health care reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, with respect to the ACA, tax reform legislation was enacted that eliminated the tax penalty established for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. As another example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. The revisions were challenged in court and, pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed, and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032. Certain pharmaceutical manufacturers and organizations have filed lawsuits challenging the IRA drug price negotiation program. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could negatively affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates.

In addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2032 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of a broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.

In addition to governmental efforts in the U.S., foreign jurisdictions as well as private health insurers and managed care plans are likely to continue challenging manufacturers’ ability to obtain reimbursement, as well as the level of reimbursement, for pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products and services. These cost-control initiatives could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 also provides the U.S. FDA enhanced post- marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with REMS approved by the U.S. FDA. The U.S. FDA’s exercise of this authority has resulted (and is expected to continue to result) in increased development-related costs following the commercial launch of our products and product candidates, and could result in potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of our products, even in such products’ approved indications and patient populations.

The VectivBio Acquisition increases our exposure to doing business in foreign jurisdictions.

Following the VectivBio Acquisition, we retained VectivBio’s legacy headquarters in Basel, Switzerland and, as a result, we now have employees and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Operating in foreign jurisdictions exposes us to additional risks such as: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; compliance with different legal and regulatory regimes; foreign regulatory requirements applicable to clinical trials and obtaining approvals for product candidates; compliance with applicable data privacy laws and regimes such as the E.U. GDPR, the United Kingdom’s GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection; risk relating to the political and economic status of foreign governments; differences in the manner in which different cultures do business; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; differences in financial reporting; and operating difficulties, among other factors. The realization of any of these risks, if severe enough, could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Limitations on our ability to obtain patent protection and/or the patent rights relating to our products and our product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our products and product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.

The strength of patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Patent and application laws in various countries are also subject to change. Until they are published, publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more. As a result, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents and pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In addition, we cannot be certain that our patent applications will be granted, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.

We have several issued patents in the U.S. related to LINZESS, including a LINZESS composition of matter and methods of use patent (U.S. Patent 7,304,036) expiring in 2026. Additional U.S. patents related to LINZESS include multiple patents relating to our commercial, room temperature stable formulations of the 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg doses of linaclotide and methods of using these formulations, the latest of which expires in the early 2030s, as well as other patents covering processes for making LINZESS, formulations thereof, and molecules related to LINZESS.

In addition, we have exclusive rights to apraglutide including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the U.S. in lead indications. We aim to maintain a strong and broad estate of patents in the U.S. and other geographic areas. To this end, we have exclusively licensed 57 patents and 3 pending patent applications in the U.S., E.U., Japan, China and other jurisdictions protecting apraglutide. We also own one patent and 36 pending patent applications worldwide that cover apraglutide, including ultrapure compositions, methods of manufacture and methods of use in various diseases including aGvHD.

Although none of these issued patents currently is subject to a patent reexamination or review, we cannot guarantee that they will not be subject to reexamination or review by the USPTO in the future. We believe in the strength of our LINZESS and apraglutide patent portfolio and that we have sufficient freedom to operate; however, if any of our present or future patents is challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, or our pending patent applications are not granted, our ability to prevent third parties from competing with LINZESS or apraglutide could be limited and our business and financial results may be materially harmed.

Furthermore, the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, has made several major changes in the U.S. patent statutes. These changes permit third parties to challenge our patents more easily and create uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and practice of U.S. patent law. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases that narrow the scope of patent protection available and weakening the rights of patent owners in certain circumstances. Depending on the impact of these decisions and other actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, and their foreign counterparts, the laws and regulations governing patents may change, or their interpretation or implementation may change, in unpredictable ways that could impact our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce and defend patents that we have already obtained or that we might obtain in the futures. For example, such changes may increase the costs and complexity associated with obtaining, enforcing or defending our patents, including in ANDA litigation.

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our partners and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible, however, that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.

In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the U.S., and, therefore, we or our partners may encounter problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.

If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our commercial success depends on our ability, and the ability of our partners, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our partners are developing products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our potential products may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. There may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware that may be infringed by LINZESS, apraglutide, or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications which may later result in issued patents that LINZESS, apraglutide, or our product candidates may infringe.

We may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by third parties alleging that LINZESS, apraglutide, or our product candidates infringe their intellectual property rights. If LINZESS, apraglutide, or one of our product candidates is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we or our partners could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to develop or commercialize LINZESS, apraglutide, or the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license to the intellectual property rights. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the counterparty could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, pending a trial on the merits, which may not occur for several years.

There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our partners infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:

*   infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time- consuming to litigate and may divert our management’s attention from our core business;

*   substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product atissue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner’s attorneys’ fees;

*   a court prohibiting us from selling our product unless the third party licenses its rights to us, which it is not required to do;

*   if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees or grant cross- licenses to our intellectual property rights; and

*   redesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.

*If we fail to comply with our obligations or have disagreements over contract interpretation in agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationship with our licensor, the scope of our intellectual property or technology rights could be narrowed and we could lose license rights that are important to our business.*

Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited to:

*   the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;

*   the extent to which our technology and processes infringe intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;

*   the sublicensing of patent and other rights;

*   our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;

*   the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors, our collaborators and us;

*   the priority of invention of patented technology; and

*   the fulfillment of our obligations under the license.

In addition, certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If our licenses or material relationships or any in-licenses upon which our licenses are based are terminated or breached, we may:

*   lose our rights to develop and market product candidates;

*   lose patent protection for product candidates;

      <p>We are currently a party to and may in the future be party to license agreements. For example, we are a party to an amended and restated intellectual property license agreement with Ferring pursuant to which we have exclusive rights to apraglutide including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the U.S. in lead indications, or the Ferring Agreement. The Ferring Agreement imposes, and other current or future license agreements may impose, various diligence, milestone, royalty, and other obligations on us. These milestone, royalty, and other payments associated with the license, will make it less profitable for us to develop apraglutide or other product candidates that are the subject of current or future licenses. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Ferring Agreement, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we may be required to make certain payments to Ferring, or we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or Ferring may have the right to terminate the license. If the Ferring Agreement is terminated, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business, be liable for damages to the licensor or be prevented from developing and commercializing our apraglutide. Termination of the agreement or a reduction or elimination of our rights under the agreement may also result in us being required to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms, and it is possible that we may be unable to obtain any such additional license at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms and will be unable to develop and commercialize apraglutide. These or similar risks may apply to other license agreements, including future license agreements.</p>
      <p>In some cases, patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensor fails to obtain or maintain a patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners.</p>

Litigation with generic manufacturers has become increasingly common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, an infringement or invalidity proceeding, a court or patent administrative body may determine that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.</p>
      <p>Generic drug manufacturers were first able to file ANDAs for generic versions of LINZESS in August 2016.

LINZESS. We filed patent infringement lawsuits against five companies making such ANDA filings and subsequently entered into settlement agreements with each of these filers. Frequently, innovators receive multiple ANDA filings. Consequently, we may receive additional notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA (and we may receive amendments to those notice letters), but we may not become aware of these filings for several months after any such submission due to procedures specified under applicable U.S. FDA regulations.

After evaluation, we have in the past filed, and may, in the future, file patent infringement lawsuits or take other action against companies making ANDA filings. If a patent infringement suit has been filed within 45 days of receipt of a notice letter, the U.S. FDA is not permitted to approve any ANDA that is the subject of such lawsuit for 30 months from the date of the NDA holder’s notice letter, or until a court decides that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Additionally, the validity of the patents relating to our products and our product candidates may be challenged by third parties pursuant to administrative procedures introduced by the America Invents Act, specifically inter partes review, or IPR, and/or post grant review, or PGR, before the USPTO. Generic drug manufacturers may challenge our patents through IPRs or PGRs instead of or in addition to ANDA legal proceedings.

Patent litigation (including any lawsuits that we file against generic drug manufacturers in connection with the receipt of a notice letter), IPRs and PGRs involve complex legal and factual questions and we may need to devote significant resources to such legal proceedings. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of any such patent-related lawsuits or administrative proceedings, including any settlements or other resolutions thereof which could, in addition to other risks, result in a shortening of exclusivity periods. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of the patents relating to our products and our product candidates at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, or could otherwise result in a loss of patent protection for one of our products or product candidates at risk of not issuing, which would materially harm our business. Upon any loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon an “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation, before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, our revenues for that product could be significantly reduced in a short period of time, which would materially and adversely affect our business.

Interference or derivation proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to the patents relating to our products and our product candidates and patent applications or those of our partners. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. In addition, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our partners, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.

Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, as well as the potential for public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceeding or developments, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.

Risks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements

We incurred significant losses from our inception in 1998 through the year ended December 31, 2018, and we may incur losses in future periods.

In recent years, we have focused primarily on developing, manufacturing and commercializing linaclotide, as well as developing our other product candidates. For example, in June 2023, we acquired VectivBio and added apraglutide, a next generation long-acting GLP-2 analog, in development for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF, to our pipeline. We have financed our business to date primarily through the issuance of equity, our collaboration and license arrangements, and debt issuances, including our August 2019 issuance of the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, bearing an interest of 0.75% and due in 2024, or the 2024 Convertible Notes, the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, bearing an interest of 1.50% and due in 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes (together with the 2024 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes), and our four-year $500.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility. We currently derive a significant

We may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could cause us to delay, reduce or eliminate our corporate or product development or commercialization efforts.

We have previously raised funds to finance our operations through capital raising activities, including the sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock in public offerings and convertible and other debt issuances. However, marketing and selling gastrointestinal drugs, purchasing commercial quantities of pharmaceutical products, developing product candidates, conducting clinical trials and accessing externally developed products or product candidates are expensive and uncertain. Circumstances, our strategic imperatives, or opportunities to create or acquire new programs, as well as maturities, redemptions or repurchases of our outstanding debt securities, could require us to, or we may choose to, seek to raise additional funds. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

*   the level of underlying demand for our products by prescribers and patients in the countries in which they are approved;
*   the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;
*   the costs of establishing, maintaining and/or expanding sales, marketing, distribution, and marketaccess capabilities for our products;
*   the regulatory approval of linaclotide within new indications, populations and formulations, as well asthe associated development and commercial milestones and royalties;
*   the rate of progress, the cost of our clinical trials and the other costs associated with our development programs, including our clinical trial of apraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, post-approval nonclinical and clinical studies of linaclotide in pediatrics and our investment to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS within IBS-C and CIC, as well as to study linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions;
*   the costs and timing of in-licensing additional products or product candidates or acquiring other complementary companies or assets;
*   the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and license agreements;
*   the status, terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing, co-commercialization or other arrangements;
*   the timing of any regulatory approvals of apraglutide and our other productcandidates;

*   whether the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes hold the notes to maturity without conversion into our Class A Common Stock or cash and whether we are required to repurchase any of our Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity upon a fundamental change, as defined in each of the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes; and

*   whether we seek to redeem, repurchase or retire all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.

Additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of our commercialization efforts, delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our development programs or delay or abandon potential strategic opportunities.

Our ability to pay principal of and interest on our outstanding debt will depend in part on the receipt of payments from AbbVie under our collaboration agreement for North America.

Semi-annual payments on our Convertible Senior Notes began in December 2019. In addition, in May 2023, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $300.0 million. We expect that for the next few years, at a minimum, the net quarterly payments from AbbVie will be a significant source of cash flows from operations. If the cash flows derived from the net quarterly payments that we receive from AbbVie under the collaboration agreement for North America are insufficient on any particular payment date to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, we will be obligated to pay the amounts of such shortfall. The determination of whether AbbVie will be obligated to make a net quarterly payment to us in respect of a particular quarterly period is a function of the revenue generated by LINZESS in the U.S. as well as the development, manufacturing and commercialization expenses incurred by each of us and AbbVie under the collaboration agreement for North America. Accordingly, since we cannot guarantee that our company will maintain net income or positive cash flows, we cannot provide assurances for any particular quarterly period that (i) we will have the available funds to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, in the event that there is a deficiency in the net quarterly payment received from AbbVie, (ii) there will be a payment from AbbVie at all or (iii) we will not also be required to make a true-up payment to AbbVie under the collaboration agreement for North America.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.

As of December 31, 2023, we had total indebtedness of $700.0 million and available cash and cash equivalents of $92.2 million.

We incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. In May 2023, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility, which includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. In June 2023, we borrowed $400.0 million to fund a portion of the consideration paid to purchase VectivBio’s outstanding ordinary shares in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. As of December 31, 2023, we have repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding principal balance.

The agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, contains certain covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries that may, under certain circumstances, impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including, without limitation, limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, various fundamental changes, dividends and distributions, investments (including acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, asset sales, prepayment of junior financing, changes in business and other limitations customary in senior secured credit facilities. The Revolving Credit Agreement also includes cross-default features providing that a default under certain other indebtedness would result in a default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, in each case at the end of each of four fiscal quarters. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows us to elect to increase the permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters in the event we elect to consummate an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50 million, subject to certain limitations on how often this election can be made. Additionally, the lenders under the Revolving

Credit Agreement will be permitted to accelerate all outstanding borrowings and other obligations, terminate outstanding commitments and exercise other specified remedies upon the occurrence of customary events of default.

In addition, while none of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes include covenants restricting the operation of our business except in certain limited circumstances, in the event of a default under any of the Convertible Senior Notes, the applicable noteholders or the trustee or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable payment obligations under such Convertible Senior Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which could include, among other things, any acquisition of our company (other than an acquisition in which at least 90% of the consideration is Class A Common Stock listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market or The New York Stock Exchange), subject to the terms of each of the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes. The repurchase price must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our security holders.

Each of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes also includes cross-default features providing that certain failures to pay for outstanding indebtedness would result in a default under the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes. In the event of such default, the trustee or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable under the applicable indenture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

To the extent we become subject to such covenants, our ability to comply with such covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. The ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will also depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy and realize the anticipated benefits of the VectivBio Acquisition, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies.

Our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences on our business, including:

*   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, including product development, commercialization efforts, research and development activities, strategic arrangements, acquisitions and refinancing of our outstanding debt;
*   requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, corporate transactions and other general corporate purposes;
*   increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitiveconditions;
*   limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which wecompete;
*   placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparabledebt at more favorable interest rates; and
*   increasing our cost of borrowing.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including payments of principal when due on our outstanding indebtedness or, in the case of our Convertible Senior Notes, in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental change under the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes, or under our Revolving Credit Facility, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay currently planned activities or curtail operations, seek to raise additional capital or take other actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This, together with any of the factors described above, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The capped call transactions entered into in connection with our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes may affect the value of our Class A Common Stock.

In connection with the issuance of our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. These transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of our 2024 Convertible Notes or our 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable, or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be.

In connection with these transactions, the financial institutions likely purchased our Class A Common Stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various OTC derivative transactions with respect to our Class A Common Stock. These entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable, by purchasing and selling shares of our Class A Common Stock or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock and, as a result, the number of shares and the value of the Class A Common Stock noteholders will receive upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable. In addition, under certain circumstances the counterparties have the right to terminate the Capped Calls on terms set forth in the applicable confirmations, which may result in us not receiving all or any portion of the anticipated benefit of the Capped Calls. If the price of our Class A Common Stock increases such that the hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could also be exposed to credit risk related to the counterparties to the Capped Calls, which would limit or eliminate the benefit of such transactions to us.

Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly.

We expect our operating results to be subject to frequent fluctuations. Our net income (loss) and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:

*   the level of underlying demand and price for our products in the countries in which they areapproved;
*   retail chains’ and wholesalers’ buying patterns, pricing and reimbursement and inventory levels with respect to our products;
*   the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;
*   the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and license agreements;
*   our execution of any collaboration, partnership, licensing or other strategic arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;
*   any impairments of assets or goodwill, and associated write-downs;
*   any variations in the level of expenses related to our developmentprograms;
*   addition or termination of clinical trials;
*   any impact on taxes or changes in tax rules;
*   regulatory developments affecting our products and productcandidates;
*   any material lawsuit in which we may become involved; and
*   the impact of public health emergencies, including containmentor mitigation measures, or natural disasters.

If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts for any of the foregoing reasons or otherwise, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.

Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use such carryforwards, or that certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

Prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred significant net losses since our inception. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the future, unused net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until the date, if any, on which such unused carryforwards expire. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change. Certain future equity offerings or strategic transactions, if any, could potentially result in a 50% or greater change of control.

If we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration, if any, of the applicable carryforwards or if the carryforwards are subject to the limitations described above, we may be unable to offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal or state income tax liability. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Section 382, or could result in a change in control in the future.

Our ability to use foreign tax loss carryforwards acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition may be limited.

Prior to our acquisition of VectivBio, VectivBio incurred significant net losses since its inception. In Switzerland, tax loss carryforwards may, with certain limitations, be used to offset future taxable income. However, if not utilized, the tax loss carryforwards, under Swiss laws, expire seven years after the tax year in which they were incurred. Due to our current limited income in Switzerland, there is a high risk that the tax loss carryforwards will expire in part or in their entirety and will not be used to offset future taxable income. Any limitations in our ability to use tax loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could adversely affect our financial condition.

If the distribution of the shares of Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or Cyclerion, common stock in connection with the Separation is not generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

The distribution, together with certain related transactions, is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to usand our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, under the pilot program established in Revenue Procedure 2017-52 relating to the U.S. federal income tax distribution. Consistent with the guidelines set forth in Revenue Procedure 2017-52, the IRS private letter ruling does not cover all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, completion of the distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, our receipt of an opinion from an outside tax advisor that the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to both us and our stockholders for U.S. income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The private letter ruling and opinion were based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings from us and Cyclerion (including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and Cyclerion). If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Cyclerion breach any of our respective covenants relating to the distribution, the IRS private letter ruling and any tax opinion may be invalid. Moreover, the opinion is not binding on the IRS or any courts. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the

56

Table of Contents

IRS private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would recognize taxable gain with respect to Cyclerion’s distributed common stock and our stockholders who received shares of Cyclerion common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.

General Risk Factors

*We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we lose any of our current management team or if we are unable to attract, motivate and retain key personnel.*

We may not be able to attract, motivate or retain qualified management and scientific, clinical, operations and commercial personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the greater-Boston area. If we are not able to attract, motivate and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we will experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our objectives.

We are highly dependent on the drug research, development, regulatory, commercial, financial and other expertise of our management, particularly Thomas McCourt, our chief executive officer; Sravan Emany, our senior vice president, chief financial officer; Andrew Davis, our senior vice president, chief business officer; John Minardo, our senior vice president, chief legal officer and secretary; and Michael Shetzline, our senior vice president, chief medical officer and head of research and drug development. Transitions in our senior management team or other key employees, or the unavailability of any such persons for any reason, can be inherently difficult to manage and may disrupt our operations or business or otherwise harm our business, for example due to the diversion of our board and management’s time and attention and a decline in employee morale. In addition to the competition for personnel, the Boston area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts, which may or may not be successful.

We also have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development, clinical strategies and our global supply chain plans, as well as sales and marketing advisors who have assisted us in our commercialization strategy and brand plan for our products. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development and commercialization of products that may compete with ours.

*Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology structure could compromise our information, disrupt our business and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.*

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our patients, clinical trial participants and employees. We also rely to a large extent on information technology systems to operate our business, including to deliver our products. We have outsourced elements of our confidential information processing and information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our large and complex information technology and infrastructure (and those of our partners, vendors and other third-party providers) may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee, partner, vendor or third-party error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. While we have invested in information technology and security and the protection of confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or

security breaches. Further, while some or all of our workforce, and those of our partners, vendors and other third-party providers, work remotely, we may have greater vulnerability to cyberattacks or other losses of confidential information, as well as interruptions in information technology systems. Any such interruptions, losses or breaches would substantially impair our ability to operate our business and would compromise our confidential information, and that of our partners, vendors and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, negatively impact our financial condition and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial or other losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our (or our partners’, vendors’ and third-party providers’) systems.

Anti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These provisions include the following:

*   Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of theboard of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.
*   Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock. The ability to authorize preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
*   Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directorsor to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect such acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
*   Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are not able to take certain actions outside of a stockholders’ meeting.
*   Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, ourchief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are not able to call a special meeting.
*   A super-majority (80%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are required to amendour bylaws, which make it more difficult to change the provisions described above.

In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combination transactions with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors.

If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which could negatively affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our

      <p>internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and includes elements that rely on information from third parties, including our partners. Our system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected.</p>
      <p>Further, we are dependent on our partners for information related to our results of operations. Our net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. is partially determined based on amounts provided by AbbVie and involves the use of estimates and judgments, which could be modified in the future. We are highly dependent on our partners for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of linaclotide in their respective territories, and in the case of AbbVie for the U.S., the costs incurred in developing and commercializing it in order to accurately report our results of operations. Our results of operations are also dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of information from any other licensing, collaboration or other partnership agreements we may have, as well as our partners’ use of estimates and judgments. If we do not receive timely and accurate information or if estimated activity levels associated with the relevant collaboration or partnership at a given point in time are incorrect, whether the result of a material weakness or not, we could be required to record adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could have an adverse effect on our financial results, which could lead to a decline in our Class A Common Stock price.</p>
      <p>If we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.</p>
      <p><b>We expect that the price of our Class A Common Stock will fluctuate substantially.</b></p>
      <p>The market price of our Class A Common Stock may be highly volatile due to many factors, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the commercial performance of our products in the countries in which they are approved, as well as thecosts associated with such activities;</li>

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest or certain other stockholder actions.

Responding to certain stockholder actions can be costly, disruptive and time-consuming, and could also impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. For example, a proxy contest for our annual meeting of stockholders relating to stockholder proposals or director nominees would require significant time and could divert the attention of our management, other employees and our board of directors. In addition, a proxy contest would require us to incur significant costs, including legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. The realization of any of the risks described in these “Risk Factors” could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

We have a multilayered framework for assessing, identifying, detecting and responding to reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information technology, or IT, systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. In the event of a material change to our systems or operations, we conduct an assessment of the internal and external threats to the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and systems, along with other material risks to our operations. We leverage third-party security services for audit, benchmarking, and use various tools and methodologies to manage cybersecurity risks that are tested regularly, including a cybersecurity assessment guided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework and ongoing security awareness training. We oversee third-party service providers by conducting vendor diligence upon onboarding and ongoing monitoring. Vendors are assessed for risk based on the nature of their external access threats and social engineering landscapes, based on that assessment, we conduct diligence that may include completing security questionnaires, internet protocol reputation, onsite evaluation, and scans or other technical evaluations. We also monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity posture and performance on an ongoing basis through regular vulnerability scans, simulated phishing tests, penetration tests, and threat intelligence feeds. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

We have developed an incident response plan designed to coordinate the activities that we and our third-party security service provider take to prepare to respond and recover from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity, investigate, escalate, contain, and remediate an incident, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate any reputational damage.

Our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company’s Chief Information Officer, or CIO, is responsible for developing and implementing our information security program and reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and management. Our CIO has over 20 years of cybersecurity experience in various roles involving information security, developing cybersecurity strategies, and implementing cybersecurity programs.

Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our cybersecurity risk and receives regular reports, with a minimum frequency of once per year, from our CIO on various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance. Promptly after becoming aware of a material cybersecurity incident affecting our IT systems or data, the Audit Committee would work with management to formulate a mitigation plan and review compliance with such plan, as well as to ensure compliance with any external regulatory or disclosure requirements, including any disclosures of material cybersecurity breaches.

Item 2. Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts, where, as of December 31, 2023, we occupied approximately 39,000 square feet of office space under our lease expiring in June 2030. We also have operations in Basel, Switzerland. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Shares of our Class A Common Stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "IRWD." Our shares have been publicly traded since February 3, 2010. As of January 31, 2024, there were 29 stockholders of record of our Class A Common Stock. The number of record holders is based upon the actual number of holders registered on the books of the company at such date and does not include holders of shares in "street names" or persons, partnerships, associations, corporations or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.

Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to share equally in any dividends that our board of directors may determine to issue from time to time. In the event a dividend is paid in the form of shares of common stock or rights to acquire shares of common stock, the holders of Class A Common Stock will receive Class A Common Stock, or rights to acquire Class A Common Stock, as the case may be.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance operations and any acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies or other strategic transactions. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, future prospects, contractual restrictions and covenants and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

The information required to be disclosed by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K, "Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans," is referenced under Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 is included in Part II, Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022
filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023.
Overview
We are a GI healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for
GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant
unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.
LINZESS® (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines
called GC-C agonists, and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C, or CIC, and for pediatric patients ages 6-17
years-old suffering from FC. LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the U.S., Mexico, and
Saudi Arabia, to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C in China and for pediatric
patients ages 6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women
suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.
We have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of
linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie in the U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong
Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas in Japan.
We also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional treatment
options to GI patients.
In June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio. In December 2023, we
completed a squeeze-out merger to acquire all remaining shares. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with $400.0 million
of borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 10, Debt, to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Through the acquisition, the Company is
advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of GLP-2, for rare gastrointestinal diseases, including SBS-IF, as
well as several earlier stage assets.
In November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement, with COUR, that grants us an option to acquire an
exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing
immune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of PBC.
We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as IC/BPS,
and endometriosis.
To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as
well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred net
losses in each year since inception. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded net loss of approximately $1.0 billion, which
included a charge of approximately $1.1 billion related to acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, in connection
with the VectivBio Acquisition. For the years ended 2022 and 2021, we recorded net income of $175.1 million and $528.4 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an

accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee that our
company will be able to maintain positive cash flows.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We operate in one reportable business segment - human therapeutics.
Key 2023 Financial Highlights
*   We recognized $442.7 million in total revenues during the year ended December 31 2023, compared to $410.6 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $31.7 million in
    collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.
*   We recognized $430.5 million in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. during the
    year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $398.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase
    was primarily driven by increased prescription demand, partially offset by inventory channel fluctuations.
*   We generated a loss from operations of $945.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to income
    from operations of $250.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to
    approximately $1.1 billion in IPR&D expense related to the VectivBio Acquisition.
*   We generated $183.4 million in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, ending the year with
    $92.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Financial Operations Overview

*Revenues.* Our revenues are generated primarily through our collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to
research and development and commercialization of linaclotide.
The majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. We record our share of the net profits and
losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and
from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales
to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative
expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between AbbVie and us, resulting in
collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and
administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the
timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future
strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian, Mexican,
Japanese, or Chinese markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval and is commercialized.
*Cost of Revenues.* Cost of revenues primarily includes costs related to the sales of linaclotide API, finished drug product, and
finished goods to our partners, which generally occurs upon shipment for sales of API, finished drug product and finished goods after
the material has passed all quality testing required for acceptance by the partner to certain of our partners outside of the U.S.
*Research and Development Expense.* The core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our demonstrated
expertise and capabilities in GI diseases to bring multiple medicines to patients. Research and development expense consists of
expenses incurred in connection with the research into and development of products and product candidates. These expenses consist
primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party
contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration
of third-party manufacturing facilities, and licensing fees for our product candidates.

Research and development expenses include amounts owed to AbbVie on an ongoing basis under cost-sharing provisions in
our collaboration agreement for linaclotide. Reimbursements received for research and development activities under this agreement
are netted against research and development expenses.

Linaclotide. Our commercial product, LINZESS, is commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C or CIC in
adults and for FC in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Linaclotide is also available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-
C or CIC in certain countries of the world, including China, Japan, and in a number of E.U. countries.

We and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional
indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020, based on the Phase
IIIb data of linaclotide 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in adult patients with IBS-C, the
U.S. FDA approved our sNDA to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label.

In addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand
the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based
on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of
serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and
contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. In June 2023,
the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the
first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in
patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional
clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.

Apraglutide. Refer to Acquired In-Process Research and Development.

CNP-104. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC,
a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104. COUR
is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC
patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.

IW-3300. We are developing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including
IC/BPS and endometriosis. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy
volunteers and are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.

IW-3718. We were developing IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant, for the potential treatment
of refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, or refractory GERD. In September 2020, we announced that one of our two identical
Phase III trials evaluating IW-3718 in refractory GERD did not meet the pre-specified criteria associated with a planned early efficacy
assessment and, based on these findings, we discontinued development of IW-3718.

Early research and development. Our early research and development efforts have been focused on supporting our
development stage GI programs, including exploring strategic options for further development of certain of our internal programs, as
well as evaluating external development-stage GI programs.

(1) Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulations.
(2) Includes $11.3 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million of employer payroll tax expense recognized in the
second quarter of 2023 immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration
and settlement of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.
(3) Includes $6.0 million up-front payment recognized in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the amendment to the COUR

The lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any
failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development
efforts and our business overall.

We and AbbVie are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide
in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. We cannot currently estimate
with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for additional
indications, populations or formulations.

Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any
degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain
regulatory approval to market them.

As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate
precisely when, if ever, linaclotide's utility will be expanded within its currently approved indications; if or when linaclotide will be
developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, any of our other product
candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.

We invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs
is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit
within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in
internally discovered assets.

The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not
limited to:

*   The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product
    candidate;

*   The U.S. FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the
    introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical
    testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures;

# Page 69 of 140

# Table of Contents

*   Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to
    discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to
    varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;
*   The duration and cost of early research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials, may vary
    significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict;
*   The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable, and, even if approved,
    a product may face post-approval development and regulatory requirements;
*   There may be substantial costs, delays and difficulties in successfully integrating externally developed product
    candidates into our business operations; and
*   The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact
    us.

As a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages
of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product
candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make
determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in
response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate's
commercial potential.

We expect to invest in our development programs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide,
including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its currently approved indications, and the exploration of its
potential utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will continue to invest in our GI-focused product candidates as
we advance them through pre-clinical and clinical trials, in addition to funding research and development activities under our external
collaboration and license agreements.

*Acquired In-Process Research and Development.* Asset acquisition costs, license fees and development milestone payments
related to acquired and in-licensed products and technology are expensed as acquired in-process research and development at the
point that they have no established alternative future use.

Through the VectivBio Acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, long-acting synthetic peptide analog
of GLP-2, as a differentiated therapeutic for a wide range of rare diseases, including SBS-IF and aGvHD.

Apraglutide for SBS-IF. We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of apraglutide
in adult patients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October 2023, we presented positive final data
from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity during United European
Gastroenterology (UEG) Week. We are also conducting open label extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and
tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential submissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S.,
European Union, or E.U., and Japan. In October 2023, we presented positive final data from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study
during United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week. This multicenter, open-label study of nine patients was designed to evaluate
the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of apraglutide on intestinal absorption in adult patients who have SBS-IF and colon-in-
continuity.

Apraglutide for aGvHD: We are conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients
with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal aGvHD and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.

*Selling, General and Administrative Expense.* Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of
compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information
technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include
legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs
and professional fees for accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of
LINZESS and other product candidates, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the
foreseeable future.

We include AbbVie's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net
losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative
arrangements revenue, respectively.

*Restructuring Expenses*. Restructuring expenses pertain to a workforce reduction in April 2023 and restructuring initiatives,
which commenced in June 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. The workforce reduction and restructuring initiatives
are more fully described in Note 16, *Workforce Reductions and Restructuring*, to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

*Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs*. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related
to our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of debt issuance
costs.

*Interest and Investment Income*. Interest and investment income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents,
as well as significant financing components of payments due from collaboration partners.

*Gain (Loss) on Derivatives*. In June 2015, we issued 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022, or the 2022
Convertible Notes, and in August 2019, we issued the Convertible Senior Notes. In connection with the issuance of our 2022
Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the Convertible Note Hedges, and separate note hedge
warrant transactions, or the Note Hedge Warrants, with certain financial institutions. Gain (loss) on derivatives consists of the change
in fair value of the Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, which are recorded at fair value at each reporting date and
changes in fair value are recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge
Warrants terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and April 2023, respectively. The Convertible Note Hedges and Note
Hedge Warrants are more fully described in Note 10, *Debt*, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

*Income Taxes*. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the income tax accounting rules and each
jurisdiction's enacted tax laws and regulations. At interim reporting dates, we record our income tax provision by applying our
estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring
items. For additional information refer to Note 14, *Income Taxes*, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported
results in the period in which they become known.

We believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and
estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, *Summary of Significant Accounting Policies*, to our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

**Acquisitions**

We evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as
a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the
gross assets acquired is concentrated into a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen test is met, a
single asset or group of assets is not a business and is accounted for

69

# Page 71 of 140

Table of Contents

as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, further determination is required as to whether we have acquired inputs and
processes that have the ability to create outputs that would meet the requirements of a business.

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the acquiring entity to
recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement
point. We determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's estimate of the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

We account for asset acquisitions that are not determined to be a business combination by recognizing net assets based on
the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to
acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to research and development expense at the acquisition date. We classify
asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D as investing activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

Upon executing a revenue generating arrangement, we assess whether it is probable we will collect consideration in
exchange for the good or service it transfers to the customer and perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a
customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.
We must develop assumptions that require significant judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance
obligation identified in the contract. The assumptions that are used to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted
revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory
success.

Our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to the development
and commercialization of linaclotide. The terms of the collaborative arrangements and other agreements contain multiple performance
obligations which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, including participation on joint steering
committees, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or development materials for a partner, which are reimbursed at a
contractually determined rate, and (iv) education or co-promotion activities by our clinical sales specialists. Non-refundable payments
to us under these agreements may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii)
payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of
certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives, and (vi) royalties
on product sales. Additionally, we receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in
the U.S. We have adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of tax withholdings, as applicable.

Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements

Upon licensing intellectual property, we determine if the license is distinct from the other performance obligations identified
in the arrangement. We recognize revenues from the transaction price, including non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license
when the license is transferred to the customer if the license has distinct benefit to the customer. For licenses that are combined with
other promises, we assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance
obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we evaluate the
measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.

Our license and collaboration agreements include milestone payments, such as development and other milestones. We
evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction
price using the most likely amount method at the inception of the agreement. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would
not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such
as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is
then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when
the performance obligations under the

70


---


# Page 72 of 140

Table of Contents
contract are satisfied. We re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint at each reporting
period, and any adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Agreements that include the supply of API or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the
customer's discretion are generally considered as options. We assess if these options provide a material right to our partner, and if so,
they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If we are entitled to additional payments when the customer exercises
these options, any additional payments are recorded as revenue when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is typically
upon shipment for sales of API and finished drug product.

For agreements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license
is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue when the related sales occur in accordance
with the sales-based royalty exception.

Net Profit or Net Loss Sharing
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 808, *Collaborative Arrangements*, or ASC 808, we
considered the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement and the nature of our business operations to determine the
classification of payments under our collaboration agreements. While ASC 808 provides guidance on classification, the standard is
silent on matters of separation, initial measurement, and recognition. Therefore, we apply the separation, initial measurement, and
recognition principles of ASC Topic 606, *Revenue from Contracts with Customers*, to our collaboration agreements.

Our collaborative arrangements revenue generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. are considered akin to sales-based
royalties. We recognize our share of the pre-tax commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in
the period the product sales are earned, as reported by AbbVie, and related cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative
expenses as incurred by us and our collaboration partner. These amounts are partially determined based on amounts provided by
AbbVie and involve the use of estimates and judgments, such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment
discounts, chargebacks, governmental and contractual rebates, wholesaler fees, product returns, and co-payment assistance costs,
which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. We are highly dependent on AbbVie for timely and accurate information
regarding any net revenues realized from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in accordance with ASC 808, and the related costs, in order to
accurately report its results of operations. If we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels
associated with the collaboration at a given point in time, we could be required to record adjustments in future periods.

We record revenue transactions as net product revenue in our consolidated statements of income if we are deemed the
principal in the transaction, which includes being the primary obligor, retaining inventory risk, and control over pricing. Given that we
are not the primary obligor and do not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, we
record our share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present the settlement
payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. We and AbbVie settle
the cost sharing quarterly, such that our consolidated statements of income reflect 50% of the pre-tax net profit or loss generated from
sales of LINZESS in the U.S.

Sale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient

The Company is not currently responsible for the supply of linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods or
development materials to its partners, though the Company may provide development materials to certain of its partners on a periodic
basis. Sales of such development materials have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial.

We recognize revenue on linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods, and development materials when control
has transferred to the partner, which generally occurs upon shipment after the material has passed all quality testing required for
acceptance by the partner.

Other

Our deferred revenue balance consists of advance billings and payments received from customers in excess of revenue
recognized.

Research and Development Expense
We have committed significant resources into the research and development of our product candidates and intend to
continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Research and development expenses are generally expensed as incurred. We capitalize
nonrefundable advance payments we make for research and development activities and defer expense recognition until the related
goods are received or the related services are performed.
Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities,
including salary, benefits, share-based compensation, and other employee-related expenses; laboratory supplies and other direct
expenses; facilities expenses; overhead expenses; third-party contractual costs relating to nonclinical studies and clinical trial
activities and related contract manufacturing expenses, development of manufacturing processes and regulatory registration of third-
party manufacturing facilities; licensing fees for our product candidates; and other outside expenses.
Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag
several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management,
monitoring costs, project management costs, and investigator fees. We maintain regular communication with our CRO vendors to
gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses
recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. However, if we incorrectly estimate
activity levels associated with the CRO services at a given point in time, we could be required to record material adjustments in future
periods. Under our collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, we are reimbursed for certain research and development
expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred.
Research and development expenses also include up-front payment, non-contingent payment, and milestone payment
obligations under the COUR Collaboration Agreement. Recognition of expense for such payments requires judgment with respect to
when the obligation is probable.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
We grant awards under our share-based compensation programs, including stock awards, restricted stock awards, or RSAS,
restricted stock units, or RSUs (including performance-based RSUs, or PSUs), stock options, and shares issued under our employee
stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of income based on
the grant date fair value over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures over the requisite
service period using historical forfeiture activity and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are
expected to vest.
We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which
requires the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The fair value of stock awards,
RSAs, and RSUs is based on the market value of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant, with the exception of PSUs with
market conditions, which are measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Discounted stock purchases under our ESPP are
valued on the first date of the offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the fair value of the lookback
provision plus the purchase discount.
For awards that vest based on service conditions and market conditions, we use the straight-line method to recognize
compensation expense over the respective service period. For awards that contain performance conditions, we determine the
appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets, which requires judgment, including
forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. At the date performance conditions are determined to be probable of
achievement, we record a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized over the remaining service period.
Throughout the performance period, we re-assess the estimated performance and update the number of performance-based awards
that we believe will ultimately vest. Discounted stock purchases under our ESPP are recognized over the offering period.
Compensation expense related to modified awards is measured based on the fair value for the awards as of the modification
date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the awards on the modification date
compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or ratably
over the remaining service period, as appropriate.

Table of Contents
While the assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management's best
estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if revisions are
made to our underlying assumptions and estimates, our share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to
period.
Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Prior to 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.
On a periodic basis, we reassess the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess
the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we reassessed the valuation allowance noting
the shift of positive evidence outweighing negative evidence, including: continued strong prescription demand growth of LINZESS,
continued profitability of a GI-focused business since completing the tax-free spin-off of Cyclerion, and expectations regarding future
profitability. After assessing both the positive evidence and negative evidence, we determined it was more likely than not that we will
realize the majority of our deferred tax assets and therefore released the majority of our valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets that are expected to be utilized in future years. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that
are unlikely to be realized, which are primarily certain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization.
Significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to the
extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. If we
determine that our net deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material changes to income tax
expense or benefit in that period.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process. First, we determine whether it is more likely than not
that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Second, for those tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Significant judgment is required in evaluating whether our tax
positions meet this two-step process. The nature of the uncertain tax positions is often complex and subject to change, and the
amounts at issue can be substantial. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis based on a number of factors
including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit and new
audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

Collaborative arrangements revenue. The increase in collaborative arrangements revenue of $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to a $31.7 million increase in our share of net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was primarily driven by increased prescription demand, partially offset by inventory channel fluctuations.

Research and development. The increase in research and development expenses of $71.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to $43.3 million of apraglutide program
costs, $11.3 million of share-based compensation and $3.5 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of
the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021
Equity Incentive Plan, a $6.0 million payment to COUR related to CNP-104 in connection with the amendment of the COUR
Collaboration Agreement, a $3.3 million increase in linaclotide program costs, and a $3.2 million increase in external costs associated
with other pipeline programs. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $15.1 million of
acquisition-related costs.

Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $42.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to $16.2 million of share-based compensation and
$3.0 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the
vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, $12.9 million of general
and administrative costs incurred for operating activities of the acquired VectivBio entities, a $5.8 million increase in compensation,
benefits, and other employee-related expenses, a $3.7 million increase of professional services costs, and a $1.6 million increase in
sales and marketing activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $25.6
million of acquisition-related costs.

Restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to
employee severance, benefits and related costs for the headquarters-based workforce reduction and VectivBio Acquisition-related
workforce reduction.

Acquired In-Process Research & Development. We incurred approximately $1.1 billion of expense during the year ended
December 31, 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition to acquire apraglutide.

Interest expense and other financing costs. Interest expense increased by $14.0 million during the year ended December 31,
2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to $15.3 million of interest expense incurred under the revolving
credit facility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.

Interest and investment income. Interest and investment income increased by $9.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from an increase in investment interest rates, as well as an
increase in investment balances prior to the VectivBio Acquisition.

Gain on derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an insignificant gain on derivatives resulting
from a decrease in the fair value of the Note Hedge Warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry in April 2023.

Income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $83.5 million, comprised of
non-cash tax expense of $74.1 million and cash tax expense of $9.4 million for state income taxes in certain states in which state
taxable income exceeded available net operating losses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense
of $77.4 million, comprised of non-cash tax expense of $73.4 million and cash tax expense of $4.0 million for state income taxes in
certain states in which state taxable income exceeded available net operating losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2023, we had $92.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts held in
money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. We invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in
accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in certain types of investments and requires all
investments held by us to be at least A- rated, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of less than twenty-four months, so as
to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation objectives.
We anticipate our cash balance and our expected net cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our near-term and
long-term cash obligations, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Our most significant fixed obligations are debt
obligations and lease commitments, for which annual payments are disclosed in Note 10, Debt, and Note 7, Leases, respectively, to
our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases
and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases,
redemptions or exchanges, if any, of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.
In May 2021, our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our Class A Common
Stock. The program was completed in May 2022 and the repurchased shares were retired. Additional information regarding the
repurchase program is disclosed in Note 12, Stockholders' Equity, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
We had incurred losses since our inception in 1998 and until the year ended December 31, 2019. However, after achieving
profitability for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we incurred a loss of approximately $1.0 billion for year ended
December 31, 2023 due to the approximately $1.1 billion IPR&D charge recognized in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition,
and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. We have financed our operations to date
primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public sale of our common stock, debt financings, and cash
generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2023, our debt is comprised of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of
convertible notes, due at various dates between 2024 and 2026, and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility, which we entered into in May 2023 to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition. The Revolving Credit
Facility provides for $500.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Refer to Note 10,
Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information
related to our debt obligations, including the Revolving Credit Facility.

**Cash Flows from Operating Activities**

Net cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting net income for non-cash items and changes in operating
assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when
they are recognized in the results of operations.

Net cash inflows during the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $183.4 million and were derived primarily from
collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S., partially offset by research and development
expenditures for apraglutide and acquisition-related costs in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition.

Net cash inflows during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $273.8 million and were derived primarily from
collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.

**Cash Flows from Investing Activities**

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $1.0 billion and pertained
primarily to the VectivBio Acquisition.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $0.1 million and pertained to the purchase of
property and equipment.

**Cash Flows from Financing Activities**

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $277.2 million and was generated
primarily from the incurrence of $400.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $100.0 million of principal
repayments. Additionally, we paid $26.3 million to acquire subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests to complete the squeeze-
out merger in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition.

Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $237.6 million and resulted from $126.4
million of share repurchases and repayment of the $120.7 million remaining aggregate principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes upon
maturity in June 2022, partially offset by $9.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares under
our ESPP.

**Funding Requirements**

We began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, in the fourth quarter of 2012, and
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this collaboration. Our goal is to generate and maintain positive cash
flows, driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and other commercial activities and financial discipline,
while continuing to invest in the development and commercialization of linaclotide, apraglutide, and other product candidates.

Under our collaboration with AbbVie for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are
reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and AbbVie.
Additionally, we receive royalties from AbbVie based on sales of linaclotide in its licensed territories outside of the U.S. We believe
revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with AbbVie will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue
for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues from our other commercial activities,
will continue to enable us to generate positive cash flows, or to do so in the timeframes we expect. We also anticipate that we will
continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S.,
develop and commercialize other products, including apraglutide, and invest in building our pipeline through internal or external
opportunities, including potential payments associated with exercising the Option under the COUR Collaboration Agreement. We
believe that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the
next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.

Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations,
including the underlying revenue expectations and estimates regarding the costs to continue to develop, obtain regulatory approval
for, and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., as well as our expectations regarding revenue

from Astellas for Japan and AstraZeneca for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and our goal to generate and maintain positive
cash flows, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary materially and
negatively from these and other forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in the
"Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product
candidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to develop, obtain
regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide, apraglutide and our other product candidates, in each case, for all of the
markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each is suited. Our funding requirements will depend on
many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

*   the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS and CONSTELLA and from any other sources;
*   the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing and
    selling LINZESS in the U.S. and from any other sources;
*   the success of our third-party manufacturing activities;
*   the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, including
    apraglutide, as well as the timing and cost of any post-approval development and regulatory requirements;
*   the time and cost associated with integrating VectivBio's business and assets into our business operations;
*   the time and costs associated with commercial manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of apraglutide, if
    successfully developed and approved;
*   the success of our research and development efforts;
*   the emergence of competing or complementary products;
*   the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
*   the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish, including milestones,
    royalties or other payments due or payable under such agreements;
*   the settlement method used for our outstanding convertible notes; and
*   the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions, as well as the
    cost and timing of evaluating, acquiring, and, if completed, integrating into our business operations any such assets.

**Financing Strategy**

We may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements, strategic
alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital structure and to
consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. Any such capital
transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There can be no assurance that any such
financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as
structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of

78

facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any
financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees
in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries.
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not otherwise adopt any new
accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that had a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements included in this report.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments,
principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, including collateralized reverse repurchase agreements, and
money market instruments, as well as commercial paper. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of
liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without
assuming significant risk.
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of
interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the primarily short-term duration of
our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 1% change in interest rates would not have a
material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Accordingly, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be
affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio.
We do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash and
cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be
subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more
financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot
provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits.
Our Convertible Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates;
however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if our credit
rating improves or other circumstances change.
We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our four-year secured $500.0 million
Revolving Credit Facility. The increase or decrease in annual interest expense resulting from a 10% increase or decrease in the
applicable interest rate is $2.2 million.
Equity Price Risk
Our convertible notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our Class A Common
Stock at conversion or maturity of the notes. The amount of cash we may be required to pay is determined by the price of our Class A
Common Stock. The fair values of our convertible notes are dependent on the price and volatility of our Class A Common Stock and
will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes.
To minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes, we entered into the
Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, with respect to the 2022 Convertible Notes, and the Capped Calls, with respect
to the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants terminated
unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and April 2023, respectively.

The convertible notes and derivatives are more fully described in Note 10, Debt, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our foreign operations. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies. We are also exposed to unfavorable fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency has not had, nor do we believe that a decrease or increase in any foreign currency exchange rates would have, a material impact on our results of operations.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Our consolidated financial statements, together with the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), report thereon, appear at pages F-1 through F-47, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of any disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

Table of Contents

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors; and

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

As permitted by guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management excluded an assessment of the internal controls of VectivBio, which we acquired on June 29, 2023, from its evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. VectivBio represented approximately 5% of total assets and 6% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2023, and less than 1% and 2% of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework provided in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst and Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Based on management's evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded no changes during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of VectivBio Holding AG, which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 5% of total assets and total liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and less than 1% and 2% of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of VectivBio Holding AG.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related

consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B. Other Information

During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the following directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, for the purchase or sale of our securities, the material terms of which are set forth in the table below.

(1) The dates in this column represent the scheduled expiration date of each director or officer’s Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. Each Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement may terminate earlier than the date provided should all transactions contemplated thereunder occur prior to such date.

(2) Mr. Silver’s Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement provides for the (i) sale of 40,873 shares of common stock; (ii) sale of an indeterminable number of shares of common stock that Mr. Silver may purchase under the Company’s ESPP; and (iii) sale of an indeterminable number of shares of common stock. The number of shares in clause (iii) subject to RSUs that will be sold to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting is unknown as the number will vary based on the extent to which vesting conditions are satisfied and the market price of the Company’s common stock at the time of settlement. This provides for the automatic sale of shares that would otherwise be issuable on each settlement date of a RSU in an amount sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding obligation, with the proceeds of the sale delivered to the Company in satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for convertible senior notes in 2022 due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie Inc.

| Description of the Matter |
|---|
| Revenue recognized from the Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates, or “AbbVie”) was $430.5 million for the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates the majority of its revenue from a collaboration arrangement with AbbVie related to linaclotide (LINZESS). The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., less commercial expenses and treasure. |

settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable.

Auditing revenue recognition under the AbbVie collaboration was especially challenging and required significant auditor judgment because the Company relies on AbbVie for timely and accurate information regarding net profits realized from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Management uses the information provided by AbbVie, which includes net revenues from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. and related costs, to record its share of net profits and related revenue. Certain of such information received from AbbVie are determined by using estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its collaboration revenue process, including controls over the Company's evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of information related to net sales of LINZESS provided from AbbVie.

Our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting reported information provided by AbbVie to the Company related to the net profits realized from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. We analyzed the gross sales and certain adjustments to arrive at net sales, cost of goods sold, and related costs contributing to Ironwood's share of net profits and compared current period results to historical trends. We also tested settlement payments received by the Company throughout the year. In addition, we confirmed directly with AbbVie the collaborative arrangement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, related to the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. as well as the amounts due to the Company as of December 31, 2023.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 1998.

**Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1. Nature of Business**

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Ironwood" or the "Company") is a gastrointestinal ("GI") healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for GI patients. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging its demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.

LINZESS® (linaclotide), the Company's commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "U.S. FDA") in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists ("GC-C agonists") and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ("IBS-C") or chronic idiopathic constipation ("CIC") and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation ("FC"). LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States (the "U.S."), Mexico and Saudi Arabia, to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C in China, and pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.

The Company has strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of linaclotide throughout the world. The Company and its partner, AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates, "AbbVie"), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under the Company's collaboration for North America with AbbVie, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between the Company and AbbVie. Additionally, development costs are shared equally between the Company and AbbVie.

Outside of the U.S., the Company earns royalties as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient by the Company's collaboration partners. AbbVie has an exclusive license from the Company to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan and the countries and territories of North America (the "AbbVie License Territory"). In addition, AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. Astellas Pharma Inc. ("Astellas"), the Company's partner in Japan, has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates) ("AstraZeneca"), the Company's partner in China, has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products containing linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the "AstraZeneca License Territory").

In June 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding AG ("VectivBio"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments for severe, rare GI conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need. In December 2023, the Company completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining outstanding ordinary shares and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ironwood organized under the laws of Switzerland. Through the acquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 ("GLP-2"), for rare GI diseases, including short bowel syndrome dependent on parenteral support ("SBS-IF").

The Company has a collaboration and license option agreement (the "COUR Collaboration Agreement") with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. ("COUR"), a biotechnology company developing novel immune-modifying nanoparticles to treat autoimmune diseases. The COUR Collaboration Agreement grants the Company an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a potential treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver.

These and other agreements are more fully described in Note 5, *Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements*, to these consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (“IC/BPS”) and endometriosis.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, the Company changed its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, the Company has dedicated a majority of its activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of its other product candidates.

For consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the outstanding shares, the Company records net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), respectively, equal to the percentage of the common stock ownership interest retained in such entities by the noncontrolling parties. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity.

The Company acquired control of VectivBio on June 29, 2023 (Note 3). Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of VectivBio from the acquisition date through December 31, 2023. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was recorded during the period between the acquisition date and the completion of the squeeze-out merger on December 12, 2023 (Note 1). As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities.

Segment Information

Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company currently operates in one reportable business segment – human therapeutics.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period financial statement items have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company’s management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company’s management evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. Estimates and assumptions in the consolidated financial statements include those related to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions; revenue recognition; accounts receivable; useful lives of long-lived assets, including goodwill; valuation procedures for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; fair value of derivatives; income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; research and development expenses; defined benefit pension liability; and share-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with a remaining maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments qualifying as cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value. The amount of cash and cash equivalents included in cash and cash equivalents was $58.7 million and $650.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Restricted Cash

The Company is contingently liable under unused letters of credit with a bank, related to the Company’s facility lease and vehicle lease agreements. Collateral used to secure letters of credit is classified as restricted cash. The amount of restricted current assets and non-current assets was $1.3 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2022, respectively. There wasno restricted cash as of December 31, 2023.

Concentrations of Suppliers

The Company relies on its collaboration partners and their suppliers to manufacture linaclotide API, linaclotide finished drug product, and finished goods.

If any of the Company’s collaboration partners and their suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements of the supply commitments, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could require up to several months, during which time production could be delayed. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.

Accounts Receivable

The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for credit losses when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed. The Company’s receivables relate primarily to amounts reimbursed under its collaboration, license, and other agreements. The Company believes that credit risks associated with these partners are not significant. The Company reviews the need for an allowance for credit losses for its receivables based on various factors including payment history and historical bad debt experience. The Company had no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high-quality financial institutions and the Company believes that such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company has adopted an investment policy which limits the amounts the Company may invest in certain types of investments, and requires all investments held by the Company to be at least A-rated, thereby reducing credit risk exposure.

Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due under the linaclotide collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America (Note 5). The Company does not obtain collateral for its accounts receivable.

The percentages of revenue recognized from significant collaborative partners of the Company in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the accounts receivable balances, net of any payables due, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in the following table:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, and are depreciated when placed into service using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives as follows:

| Asset Description             | Estimated Useful Life (In Years) |
| :---------------------------- | :-----------------------------: |
| Laboratory equipment          |                5                |
| Computer and office equipment |                3                |
| Furniture and fixtures        |                7                |
| Software                      |                3                |

Included in property and equipment are certain costs of software obtained for internal use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and training costs related to software obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service have been capitalized as construction in process, and will be depreciated in accordance with the above guidelines once placed into service. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are comprised of the assembled workforce acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition and are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist, which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. If indications of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the carrying amount to determine whether the asset’s value is recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds such projected undiscounted cash flows, the asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.

Income Taxes

The Company provides for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, Income Taxes, by prescribing a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjusts the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain tax positions. Any changes to these estimates, based on the actual results obtained and/or a change in assumptions, could impact the Company’s income tax provision in future periods. Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income (loss).

Financing Costs
Financing costs include costs directly attributable to the Company's offerings of its equity securities and its debt financings.
Costs attributable to equity offerings are charged as a reduction to stockholders' equity against the proceeds of the offering once the
offering is completed. Costs attributable to debt financings are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt
using the effective interest method. In accordance with ASC Topic 835, *Interest*, the Company presents on its balance sheet
unamortized debt issuance costs related to convertible notes as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability and unamortized
debt issuance costs related to revolving credit arrangements as other assets.

Leases
The Company's lease portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2023 included: an office lease for its headquarters location
and other locations, vehicle leases for its salesforce representatives, and leases for computer and office equipment. The Company
determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract and determines the classification of its leases at lease
commencement. The asset component of the Company's operating leases is recorded as operating lease right-of-use assets, and the
liability component is recorded as current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion in
the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not record any finance leases.

Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term at the lease commencement date. The lease term used to measure the right-of-use asset and operating lease liability may include
options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company accounts for lease
components and non-lease components together as a single lease component for the asset class of right-of-use real estate assets. The
Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement in determining the present
value of lease payments, if an implicit rate of return is not readily determinable. Operating lease right-of-use assets are adjusted for
prepaid rent, initial direct costs, and lease incentives.

Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are remeasured upon reassessment events and modifications to leases using
the present value of remaining lease payments and estimated incremental borrowing rate at the time of remeasurement, as applicable.

Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and includes amounts related to short-term
leases. The Company has elected to not recognize lease terms with a term of twelve months or less on its balance sheet for all classes
of underlying asset types. The Company recognizes variable lease payments as operating expenses in the period in which the
obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments primarily include common area maintenance, utilities, real estate
taxes, insurance, and other operating costs that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the space leased by the Company.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities
In June 2015, the Company issued 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022 (the "2022 Convertible Notes"), and in
August 2019, the Company issued 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Convertible Notes") and1.50% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Convertible Notes", and together with the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2024 Convertible
Notes, the "Convertible Senior Notes"). In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into
convertible note hedge transactions (the "Convertible Note Hedges") and separate note hedge warrant transactions (the "Note Hedge
Warrants"), with certain financial institutions (Note 10). In connection with the partial repurchase of the 2022 Convertible Notes in
August 2019, the Company terminated its Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants proportionately. The Convertible Note
Hedges terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and the Note Hedge Warrants terminated unexercised upon expiry in April
2023. These instruments are derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815, *Derivatives and Hedging* ("ASC 815").

These derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value each reporting date and the fair value is determined using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of

F-13

# Page 107 of 140

Table of Contents
other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of income. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include the price
per share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, expected terms of the derivative instruments, strike prices of the derivative
instruments, risk-free interest rates, and expected volatility of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Changes to these inputs could
materially affect the valuation of the derivative instruments.
In August 2019, in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the
Company entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock that initially
underlie the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes (subject to anti-dilution and certain other adjustments). These
instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC 815 to be classified in stockholders' equity (deficit) and are not subsequently
remeasured as long as the conditions for equity classification continue to be met.
Share Repurchases
The Company accounts for repurchases of its Class A Common Stock on the trade date by recording the excess of the
repurchase price over the par value entirely to additional paid-in capital. All repurchased shares are retired or constructively retired.
Issued and outstanding shares are reduced by shares repurchased.
Revenue Recognition
The Company's revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to the
research and development and commercialization of linaclotide. The terms of the collaborative research and development, license, co-
promotion and other agreements contain multiple performance obligations which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and
development activities, including participation on joint steering committees, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or
development materials for a partner, which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) education or co-promotion
activities by the Company's clinical sales specialists. Non-refundable payments to the Company under these agreements may include
(i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug
product, API, or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales
detailing, promotional support services and medical education initiatives, and (vi) royalties on product sales. The Company receives
its share of the net profits or bears its share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. through its collaboration
agreement with AbbVie for North America. The Company has adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of tax withholdings, as
applicable.
Collaboration, License, and Other Commercial Agreements
Upon licensing intellectual property to a customer, the Company determines if the license is distinct from the other
performance obligations identified in the arrangement. The Company recognizes revenues from the transaction price, including non-
refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer if the license has distinct benefit to the
customer. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company assesses the nature of the combined performance
obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. For performance
obligations that are satisfied over time, the Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary,
adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
The Company's license and collaboration agreements include milestone payments, such as development and other
milestones. The Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be
included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method at the inception of the agreement. If it is probable that a
significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments
that are not within the control of the Company, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until
those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling
price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. The
Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint at each reporting period, and any
adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Table of Contents

Agreements that include the supply of API or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the
customer's discretion are generally considered as options. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to its
partner, and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If the Company is entitled to additional payments when
the customer exercises these options, any additional payments are recorded as revenue when the customer obtains control of the
goods, which is typically upon shipment for sales of API and finished drug product.

For agreements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license
is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue when the related sales occur in
accordance with the sales-based royalty exception.

Net Profit or Net Loss Sharing

In accordance with ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ("ASC 808"), the Company considers the nature and
contractual terms of the arrangement and the nature of the Company's business operations to determine the classification of payments
under the Company's collaboration agreements. While ASC 808 provides guidance on classification, the standard is silent on matters
of separation, initial measurement, and recognition. Therefore, the Company applies the separation, initial measurement, and
recognition principles of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), as applicable.

The Company's collaborative arrangements revenues generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. are considered akin to
sales-based royalties. In accordance with the sales-based royalty exception, the Company recognizes its share of the pre-tax
commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in the period the product sales are earned, as
reported by AbbVie, and related cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred by the Company and
AbbVie. These amounts are partially determined based on amounts provided by AbbVie and involve the use of estimates and
judgments, such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts, chargebacks, governmental and
contractual rebates, wholesaler fees, product returns, and co-payment assistance costs, which could be adjusted based on actual results
in the future. The Company is highly dependent on AbbVie for timely and accurate information regarding net revenues from sales of
LINZESS in the U.S. in accordance with both ASC 808 and ASC 606, and the related costs, in order to accurately report its results of
operations. If the Company does not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimates activity levels associated with
the collaboration at a given point in time, the Company could be required to record adjustments in future periods.

In accordance with ASC 606-10-55, Principal Agent Considerations, the Company records revenue transactions as net
product revenue in its consolidated statements of income if it is deemed the principal in the transaction, which includes being the
primary obligor, retaining inventory risk, and control over pricing. Given that the Company is not the primary obligor and does not
have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, it records its share of the net profits or net
losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration
expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. The Company and AbbVie settle the cost sharing quarterly such that
the Company's statements of income reflect 50% of the pre-tax net profit or loss generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S.
Sale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient

The Company is not currently responsible for the supply of linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods or
development materials to its partners, though the Company may provide development materials to certain of its partners on a periodic
basis. Sales of such development materials have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial.

The Company recognizes revenue on linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods, and development materials
when control has transferred to the partner, which generally occurs upon shipment after the material passed all quality testing required
for acceptance by the partner.

Other
The Company's deferred revenue balance consists of advance billings and payments received from collaboration partners in
excess of revenue recognized.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues includes cost related to the sales of linaclotide API, finished drug product, and finished goods and are
generally recognized upon shipment to certain of the Company's partners outside of the U.S. The Company's cost of revenues for
linaclotide consists of the internal and external costs of producing such API, finished drug product, and finished goods.
Research and Development Costs
The Company generally expenses research and development costs to operations as incurred. The Company capitalizes
nonrefundable advance payments made by the Company for research and development activities and defers expense recognition until
the related goods are received or the related services are performed.
Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities,
including salary, benefits, share-based compensation, and other employee-related expenses; laboratory supplies and other direct
expenses; facilities expenses; overhead expenses; third-party contractual costs relating to nonclinical studies and clinical trial
activities and related contract manufacturing expenses, development of manufacturing processes and regulatory registration of third-
party manufacturing facilities; licensing fees for the Company's product candidates; and other outside expenses.
The Company has certain collaboration agreements pursuant to which it shares or has shared research and development
expenses related to linaclotide. The Company records expenses incurred under such linaclotide collaboration arrangements as
research and development expense. Under the Company's collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, the Company is
reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and nets these reimbursements against its research and development
expenses as incurred.
Research and development expense includes up-front payment, non-contingent payment, and milestone payment obligations
under the COUR Collaboration Agreement (Note 5). Expense is recognized when the obligation is determined to be probable.
Restructuring Expenses
Restructuring expenses are comprised primarily of costs associated with exit and disposal activities in accordance with ASC
Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and ASC Topic 712, Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, and
include one-time termination benefits and contract-related costs. Such costs are based on estimates of fair value in the period liabilities
are incurred. The Company evaluates and adjusts these costs for changes in circumstances as additional information becomes
available.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The Company expenses selling, general and administrative costs to operations as incurred. Selling, general and
administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in the
Company's administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing,
communications and human resources functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of the Company's
intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting, tax,
consulting, legal and other services.
The Company includes AbbVie's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net
profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and presents the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense
or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.

## Share-Based Compensation Expense

The Company grants awards under its share-based compensation programs, including stock awards, restricted stock awards
("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs") (including both time-based and performance-based RSUs), stock options, and shares
issued under the Company's employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). Share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the
consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The
Company estimates forfeitures over the requisite service period using historical forfeiture activity and records share-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use
of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The fair value of stock awards, RSAs, and RSUs is
based on the market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant, with the exception of performance-based
RSUs with market conditions, which are measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method on the date of grant (Note 13).
Discounted stock purchases under the Company's ESPP are valued on the first date of the offering period using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount.

For awards that vest based on service conditions and market conditions, the Company uses a straight-line method to
recognize compensation expense over the respective service period. For awards that contain performance conditions, the Company
determines the appropriate amount to expense at each reporting date based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets,
which requires judgement, including forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. At the date performance conditions are
determined to be probable of achievement, the Company records a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized
over the remaining service period. Throughout the performance period, the Company re-assesses the estimated performance and
updates the number of performance-based awards that it believes will ultimately vest. Discounted stock purchases under the
Company's ESPP are recognized over the offering period.

Compensation expense related to modified awards is measured based on the fair value for the awards as of the modification
date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the awards on the modification date
compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or ratably
over the requisite remaining service period, as appropriate.

While the assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management's best
estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if revisions are
made to the Company's underlying assumptions and estimates, the Company's share-based compensation expense could vary
significantly from period to period.

## Patent Costs

The Company incurred and recorded as operating expense legal and other fees related to patents of $1.8 million, $1.3
million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs were charged to selling,
general and administrative expenses as incurred.

## Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution beyond common
shares for basic net income (loss) per share that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised,
converted into common shares, or resulted in the issuance of common shares that would have shared in the Company's earnings.

## Foreign Currency Translation

For subsidiaries with a different functional currency than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange
rate as of the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded in accumulated
comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Table of Contents
Acquisitions
The Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be
accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the
fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated into a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the
screen test is met, a single asset or group of assets is not a business and is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not
met, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create
outputs that would meet the requirements of a business.
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the acquiring
entity to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value
measurement point. The Company determines the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management's
estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company accounts for asset acquisitions that are not determined to be a business combination by recognizing net assets
based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated
to acquired in-process research and development ("IPR&D") with no alternative future use is charged to research and development
expense at the acquisition date. The Company classifies asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D as investing activities on its
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other
comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and certain changes in the fair value of pension plan
assets and projected benefit obligation attributed to the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) is presented as a separate component of stockholders' equity (deficit).
Subsequent Events
The Company considers events or transactions that have occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, but
prior to the filing of the financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to provide additional evidence
relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional recognition or disclosure. Subsequent events have been
evaluated through the filing of the financial statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
New Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB")
or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company did not adopt any
new accounting pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2023 that had a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
("ASU 2023-07"). The guidance in ASU 2023-07 expands prior reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring entities to
disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") and details of
how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment's performance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax
Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by greater
disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The standard is effective
for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on its consolidated financial statements.

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective, are not expected to be applicable to the Company or have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements upon future adoption.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted the following accounting pronouncement that had a material effect on its consolidated financial statements:

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). The amendments in ASU 2020-06 simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, embedded conversion features are no longer separately reported in equity and convertible instruments are now accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and the principal portions of the convertible instruments are required to be settled in cash. The standard becomes effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021. Upon adoption, entities could elect to apply the new standard on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.

The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded on the date of adoption as follows (in thousands):

| Consolidated Balance Sheet | December 31, 2021 As Reported | Effect of the Adoption of ASU 2020-06 | January 1, 2022 As Adjusted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deferred tax assets | $ 333,294 | $ 16,855 | $ 350,149 |
| Current portion of convertible senior notes | 116,858 | 3,581 | 120,439 |
| Long-term portion of convertible senior notes | 337,333 | 57,324 | 394,657 |
| Additional paid-in-capital | 1,543,357 | (110,217) | 1,433,140 |
| Retained earnings | (937,608) | 66,167 | (871,441) |

Interest expense recognized in subsequent periods is reduced as a result of accounting for convertible debt instruments as a single liability measured at amortized cost, with a decrease of $22.1 million of non-cash interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 related to convertible debt instruments outstanding on the adoption date.

The adoption of ASU 2020-06 does not impact the Company’s liquidity or cash flows.

**3. Acquisitions**

On June 29, 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio (the “VectivBio Shares”) at a price per share of $17.00, net to the shareholders of VectivBio in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “VectivBio Acquisition”). The aggregate consideration paid by the Company to acquire the shares accepted for payment was approximately $1.2 billion. The Company financed the acquisition through proceeds from the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined elsewhere below), cash on hand.

The total purchase consideration for VectivBio is as follows (in thousands):

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Cash consideration paid to selling shareholders (1) | $ 1,041,391 |
| Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options(2) | 78,003 |
| Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants(3) | 3,720 |

| :--------------------------------- | :---- |
| Transaction costs                  | 26,270 |
| Fair value of noncontrolling interest | 26,218 |
| Total purchase consideration       | 1,175,602 |

(1) The cash consideration paid to selling shareholders was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares tendered at closing of 61,258,315 at a per share price of $17.00.
(2) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio RSUs and stock options issued under VectivBio’s equity incentive plans was determined based on the total number of underlying VectivBio Shares of 8,904,171 at a per share price of $17.00, less the exercise price for stock options.
(3) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants was determined based on the total number of VectivBio warrant shares outstanding at close of 324,190 at a per share price of $11.4757 calculated as the per share price of $17.00, less the exercise price for stock options.
(4) The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares outstanding at closing of 1,547,723 at the closing date of the tender offer, using the VectivBio closing share price on June 28, 2023 of $16.94.

On December 12, 2023, the Company completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining outstanding VectivBio Shares in cash at a price of $17.00 per share, totaling $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, there wasno remaining noncontrolling interest in VectivBio. The purchase of subsidiary shares from the noncontrolling interests is recorded as an equity transaction, with no gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of income (loss), and is reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The VectivBio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC Topic 805,Business Combinations, because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identifiable IPR&D asset, apraglutide, VectivBio’s lead investigational asset. Apraglutide is a next generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being developed for a range of rare GI diseases and is currently in Phase III clinical trial for the potential treatment of SB-IF. The Company recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In accordance with the accounting for asset acquisitions, an entity that acquires IPR&D assets in an asset acquisition follows the guidance in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, which requires that both tangible and intangible identifiable research and development assets with no alternative future use be allocated a portion of the consideration transferred and recorded as research and development expense at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 billion in acquired in-process research and development expense related to the apraglutide IPR&D asset during the second quarter of 2023.

The following is the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company (in thousands):

| Assets acquired                               |       |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 123,340 |
| Prepaid expenses and other current assets     | 10,867 |
| Property and equipment                        | 126   |
| Intangible assets                             | 4,100  |
| Acquired in-process research and development | 1,095,449 |
| Total assets acquired                         | 1,233,882 |
| Liabilities assumed                           |       |
| Current liabilities                           | 42,377 |
| Other liabilities                             | 15,903 |
| Total liabilities assumed                     | 58,280 |
| Net assets acquired                           | 1,175,602 |

The Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $25.6 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, $15.1 million was included in research and development expense, and $14.9 million was included in restructuring expense within the Company’s consolidated statement of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Acquisition-related expenses include direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the transaction, including integration-related professional services and

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the potentially dilutive impact of the Convertible Senior Notes (Note 10) was determined using the treasury stock method. Under this method, no numerator or denominator adjustments arose from the principal and interest components of the Convertible Senior Notes because the Company had the intent and ability to settle the Convertible Senior Notes in cash. Instead, the Company was required to increase the diluted net income per share denominator by the variable number of shares that would be issued upon conversion if it settled the conversion spread obligation with shares. For diluted net income per share purposes, the conversion spread obligation was calculated based on whether the average market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the reporting period was in excess of the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. There was no calculated spread added to the denominator for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.

<br>

Following the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the dilutive impact of the Convertible Senior Notes is determined using the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, the Convertible Senior Notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later). Interest charges are deducted from the numerator, unless the principal amount of the convertible instruments is required to be paid in cash.

<br>

There was no dilutive impact of the 2022 Convertible Notes for the year ended December 31, 2022 because the Company had also elected prior to the beginning of the period to settle the conversion of 2022 Convertible Notes, if any, with a combination settlement of a cash payment equal to the principal value of converted notes and shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the conversion value in excess of the principal value, if any. Accordingly, interest expense was not removed from the numerator and there was no calculated spread added to the denominator because the average market price of the Company’s Class A common stock during the portion of each period in which the 2022 Convertible Notes were outstanding was not in excess of the conversion price.

5. Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements

Accounts receivable, net, included $129.1 million and $130.0 million primarily related to collaborative arrangements revenue, collectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable, net, included $112.6 million and $104.4 million due from the Company’s partner, AbbVie, net of $4.3 million and $4.0 million of accounts payable, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

<br>

The Company routinely assesses the creditworthiness of its license and collaboration partners. The Company has not experienced any material losses related to receivables from its license or collaboration partners during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.

<br>

Linaclotide Agreements

<br>

Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie

<br>

In September 2007, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of this collaboration agreement, the Company received an upfront licensing fee, equity investment, and development and regulatory milestones, and shares equally with AbbVie all development costs as well as net profits or losses from the development and sale of linaclotide in the U.S. In addition, the Company receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and funding any costs.

<br>

During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $7.0 million, $8.0 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, in total research and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America. As a result of the research and development cost-sharing provisions of the linaclotide collaboration for North America, the Company incurred $11.6 million, $8.9 million, and $11.5 million in incremental research and development costs during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, to reflect the obligations of each party under the collaboration to bear 50% of the development costs incurred.

<br>

The Company and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. The Company receives 50% of the net profits and bears 50% of the net losses from the commercial sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Net profits or net losses consist of net sales of LINZESS to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. LINZESS net sales are calculated and

recorded by AbbVie and may include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges, and other applicable deductions.

The Company evaluated its linaclotide collaboration arrangement for North America and concluded that all development-period performance obligations had been satisfied as of September 2012. The Company has determined that there are three remaining commercial-period performance obligations, which include the sales detailing of LINZESS, participation in the commercialization committee, and approved additional trials. The consideration remaining includes cost reimbursements in the U.S. and net profit and loss sharing payments based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. Royalties and net profit and loss sharing payments will be recorded as collaborative arrangements revenue or expense in the period earned, as these payments relate predominately to the license granted to AbbVie. The Company records royalty revenue in the period earned based on royalty reports from its partner, if available, or based on the projected sales and historical trends. The cost of services transferred to AbbVie during the commercialization period will be recognized as earned in accordance with the right-to-invoice practical expedient, as the Company’s right to consideration corresponds directly with the value of the services transferred during the commercialization period.

Under the Company’s linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America, LINZESS net sales are calculated and recorded by AbbVie and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges, and other applicable deductions, as noted above, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. This treatment is in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy, given that the Company is not the primary obligor and does not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America. The Company relies on AbbVie to provide accurate and complete information related to net sales of LINZESS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in order to calculate its settlement payments to and from AbbVie and record collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable.

The following table summarizes collaborative arrangements revenue from the linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 as follows (in thousands):

Pursuant to the terms of the development and commercialization agreement with AKP, VectivBio received an upfront payment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement) and was eligible to receive development related payments of JPY 1,000 million in the aggregate ($13.1 million at date of agreement), development milestones of JPY 9,000 million ($82.2 million at date of agreement) and up to JPY 19,000 million ($155.8 million at date of agreement) in commercial and sales-based milestone payments.

The development and commercialization agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the Royalty Term.

The Company identified two performance obligations consisting of the (i) exclusive license for the development and commercialization of apraglutide in Japan and (ii) development activities for conducting global trials and sharing of associated development data necessary for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval in Japan. Each performance obligation was capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. The initial transaction price was allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company assessed that it provided a right to use the license as the license exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which it is granted and therefore, was satisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The development activities are being recognized over time as the Company performs development activities related to the global trials. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the development activities using an input method, according to the costs incurred, which in management’s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. Under the performance obligation, revenue related to sales-based milestone payments and royalty payments will be recognized as the underlying sales occur.

Prior to its acquisition by the Company, VectivBio had received the upfront payment of JPY3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement), and development related payments of JPY 1,100 million ($9.0 million at date of agreement), and development milestones of JPY 500 million ($4.1 million at date of agreement).

The Company recognized $2.0 million of revenue during the period between the acquisition date of June 29, 2023 and December 31, 2023 related to development activities. As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue of $2.6 million is reported within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to development activities are expected to be recognized over the course of the development activities, which are expected to occur through 2026.

the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions for the asset or liability.

The Company's investment portfolio may include fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis. As a result, the pricing services used by the Company apply other available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark yields, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. These models take into consideration relevant credit information, perceived market movements, sector news and economic events. The inputs into these models may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other relevant data. The Company validates the prices provided by its third party pricing services by obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The Company periodically invests in certain reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized by Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their principal amount. The Company does not record an asset or liability for the collateral as the Company is not permitted to sell or re-pledge the collateral. The collateral has at least the prevailing credit rating of U.S. Government Treasuries and Agencies. The Company utilizes a third-party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure the collateral received is maintained at 102% of the reverse repurchase agreements principal amount on a daily basis.

The following tables present the assets and liabilities the Company has measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

To minimize the impact of potential dilution to the Company’s Class A common stockholders upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into separate Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Company paid the counterparties $25.2 million to enter into the Capped Calls.

The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately $13.39 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments generally similar to those applicable to the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls cover 29,867,480 shares of Class A Common Stock (subject to anti-dilution and certain other adjustments), which is the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock that initially underlie the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes.

The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of Class A Common Stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Calls as adjusted pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price per share of Class A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would nevertheless be dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls.

The Capped Calls are separate transactions entered into by and between the Company and the Capped Calls counterparties and are not part of the terms of the 2024 Convertible Notes or the 2026 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2024 Convertible Notes or the 2026 Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Calls. The Company recorded a reduction to additional paid-in capital of $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the premium payments for the Capped Calls. Additionally, the Company recorded a $0.2 million reduction to equity related to transaction costs incurred in connection with the Capped Calls during the year ended December 31, 2019. These instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC 815 to be classified in stockholders’ equity and are not subsequently remeasured as long as the conditions for equity classification continue to be met.

Revolving Credit Facility

In May 2023, in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, a letter of credit issuer and a lender, and the other agents, lenders and letter of credit issuers parties thereto.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a four-year $500.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and loans made thereunder will mature on the earliest to occur of (i) May 21, 2027 or (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of the

Company’s existing convertible notes then outstanding, unless, in the case of clause (ii), the Company’s minimum liquidity equals or exceeds certain agreed levels.

At the Company’s election, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to (a) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (as defined in Revolving Credit Agreement) plus the applicable rate (ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%) or (b) the highest of (1) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus one half of 1.0%, (2) the prime lending rate or (3) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.0% in effect from time to time plus the applicable rate (ranging from 0.75% to 2.00%). The applicable rates are based on the Company’s consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility) at the time of the applicable borrowing.

The Company pays a quarterly commitment fee of 0.30% to 0.425% on the daily amount by which the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement exceed the outstanding loans and letters of credit.

The loans and other obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company’s personal property, including a pledge of all the capital stock of subsidiaries held directly by the Company or any subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Agreement following the closing date (which pledge, in the case of any foreign subsidiary, is limited to 65% of the voting stock), subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. The Revolving Credit Agreement generally prohibits any other liens on the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company will be able to request an increase in the commitments or the addition of a term loan secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral of up to an additional amount equal to the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the trailing twelve-month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), and commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the Company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows the Company to elect to increase the permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters in the event that it consummates an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50.0 million, subject to certain limitations on how often this election can be made. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

In connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company incurred $2.9 million of debt issuance costs, which primarily consisted of $2.0 million of lender fees and $0.9 million of legal and other professional fees. The debt issuance costs are classified as other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company had unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.4 million at December 31, 2023.

In June 2023, the Company borrowed $400.0 million to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition (Note 3). The Company repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding principal balance during the year ended December 31, 2023. The outstanding principal balance on the revolving credit facility was $300.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments with AbbVie

The Company and AbbVie are jointly obligated to make minimum purchases of linaclotide API for the territories covered by the Company’s collaboration with AbbVie for North America. Currently, AbbVie fulfills all such minimum purchase commitments.

Under the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, the Company shares all development and commercialization costs related to linaclotide in the U.S. with AbbVie. The actual amounts that the Company pays to AbbVie or that AbbVie pays to the Company will depend on numerous factors outside of the Company’s control, including the success of certain clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide, the content and timing of decisions made by the regulators, the reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and the Company’s other product candidates, and other factors.

Other Funding Commitments

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has ongoing studies in various pre-clinical and clinical trial stages. The Company’s most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations. These contracts are generally cancellable, with notice, at the Company’s option and do not have any significant cancellation penalties.

Guarantees

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its directors and certain of its officers for certain events or occurrences while such director or officer is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is unlimited; however, the Company has directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that is intended to limit its exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

The Company enters into certain agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business that contain indemnification provisions. These typically include agreements with business partners, contractors, landlords, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date the Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal. Accordingly, the Company did not have any liabilities recorded for these obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Litigation

From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any of these ongoing legal matters, individually and in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2021, the Company and AbbVie entered into a settlement agreement with Teva, under which the Company and AbbVie will grant Teva a license to market a generic version of 72 mcg LINZESS beginning March 31, 2029 (subject to FDA approval), unless certain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur. With this settlement agreement, the Company and AbbVie have settled with the filers of all known ANDAs to date seeking approval to market generic versions of LINZESS.

12. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company’s preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, with each such series to consist of such number of shares and to have such terms as adopted by the board of directors. Authority is given to the board of directors to determine and fix such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including without limitation, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences.

Common Stock

The Company has one class of common stock (“Class A Common Stock”). Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share.

The Company’s stockholders are entitled to dividends if and when declared by the board of directors.

Share Repurchase Program

In May 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The Company completed the share repurchase program in May 2022 and retired the repurchased shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 10.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $123.4 million. For the overall program, under which repurchases commenced in December 2021, the Company repurchased 13.1 million shares of Class A Common Stock at an average price per share of $1.47.

2010 Purchase Plan

During 2010, the Company's stockholders approved the 2010 Purchase Plan, which gives eligible employees the right to purchase shares of common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value on the first or last day of an offering period. Each offering period is six months. There were 400,000 shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2010 Purchase Plan. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2010 Purchase Plan may be increased on the first day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 1,000,000 shares, (ii) 1% of the Class A shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such lesser number of shares as is determined by the board of directors. As of December 31, 2023, there were 4,272,975 shares available for future grant under the 2010 Purchase Plan.

2010 Equity Plan

Annual restricted stock grants to each non-employee member of the board of directors vest in full on the date immediately preceding the next annual meeting of stockholders, provided the individual continues to serve on the Company's board of directors through each vest date. Initial restricted stock grants to new non-employee members of the board of directors vest annually over a three-year period from the date of grant provided the individual continues to serve on the Company's board of directors through each vest date.

A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented below:

</table>

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSAs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $10.77, $11.22, and $11.67, respectively. The total fair value of RSAs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $2.1 million, $2.8 million, and $2.5 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

RSUs granted under the Company's equity plans represent the right to receive one share of the Company's Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. Shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock are delivered to the employee upon vesting, subject to payment of applicable withholding taxes.

Time-based RSUs

Time-based RSUs generally vest over a two-to-four-year period on the approximate anniversary of the date of grant until fully vested, provided the individual remains in continuous service with the Company through each vesting date. The fair value of all time-based RSUs is based on the market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense, including the effect of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the applicable service period.

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $14.09, $14.30, and $14.65, respectively. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. No PSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Stock Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s equity plans represent the right to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are delivered to the employee upon exercise, subject to payment of applicable withholding taxes.

The Company ceased granting stock options during the year ended December 31, 2020. Stock options previously granted under the Company’s equity plans generally have a ten-year term and vest over a period of four years, provided the individual continues to serve at the Company through the vesting dates. Options granted under all equity plans are exercisable at a price per share not less than the fair market value of options, including the effect of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of each option.

The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Company’s share-based compensation plans:

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $83.5 million, comprised of non-
cash tax expense of $74.1 million and cash tax expense of $9.4 million for state income taxes in certain states in which state taxable
income exceeded available net operating losses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax
expense of $77.4 million, comprised of non-cash tax expense of $73.4 million and cash tax expense of $4.0 million for state income
taxes in certain states in which state taxable income exceeded available net operating losses. Due to the Company's ability to utilize
its net operating losses to offset federal taxable income and taxable income in many states, the majority of the Company's tax
provision is a non-cash tax expense until the Company's net operating losses have been fully utilized. During the year ended
December 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $327.8 million, which primarily pertains to the income tax benefit
of $333.3 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of the Company's tax attributes and other deferred
tax assets, partially offset by $5.5 million of state income taxes in certain states in which the Company is unable to utilize net
operating losses to fully offset taxable income.

A reconciliation of income taxes computed using the U.S. federal statutory rate of21% to that reflected in the consolidated
statements of income (loss) are as follows (in thousands):

<br>

On a periodic basis, the Company reassesses the valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $85.6 million on deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, related primarily to deferred tax assets acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition, as well as certain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $3.1 million on deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, related primarily to certain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization.

<br>

The valuation allowance increased by $82.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily to offset the acquired foreign net operating losses from the VectivBio Acquisition. Additionally, in response to a state tax law change enacted in October 2023, the Company increased its valuation allowance on certain state tax credits that are

expected to expire prior to utilization. The valuation allowance decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022
primarily for certain tax credits that expired unused during 2022.
Additionally, the Company increased its reserves for uncertain tax positions by $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2023
in connection with a liability assumed in the VectivBio Acquisition.
Subject to the limitations described below, at December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards
of $411.8 million, of which $282.2 million is subject to expiration between 2033 and 2038 and $129.6 million may be carried forward
indefinitely. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $352.8 million to offset future state
taxable income, which is subject to expiration at various dates through 2039. The Company also had tax credit carryforwards of
$62.9 million as of December 31, 2023 to offset future federal and state income taxes, which is subject to expiration at various dates
through 2040. The Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $535.5 million, which are subject to expiration at various
dates through 2030.
Utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards may be
subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that could occur in the future in accordance with Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("IRC Section 382") and with Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well
as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and
development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and taxes, respectively. In general, an
ownership change, as defined by IRC Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public
groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.

2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Of the $98.2 million of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023,$12.8 million
