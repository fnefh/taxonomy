          SBS-IF. The acquisition, partially funded with a $400 million
          revolving credit facility, expanded Ironwood's presence in rare

          diseases.

          with significant unmet needs, leveraging their expertise in GC-C
          agonists and expanding into new mechanisms through strategic
          acquisitions and partnerships. The company maintains a balanced
          approach between commercial products (LINZESS), late-stage development
          (apraglutide), and earlier-stage programs (IW-3300, CNP-104), while
          actively seeking external innovation opportunities.
