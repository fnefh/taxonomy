## 1. Nature of Business

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Ironwood" or the "Company") is a gastrointestinal ("GI") healthcare company on a mission to advance the treatment of GI diseases and redefine the standard of care for GI patients. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging its demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.

LINZESS$^{®}$ (linaclotide), the Company's commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "U.S. FDA") in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists ("GC-C agonists") and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ("IBS-C") or chronic idiopathic constipation ("CIC") and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation ("FC"). LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States (the "U.S."), Mexico and Saudi Arabia, adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China, and pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA$^{®}$ to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.

The Company has strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of linaclotide throughout the world. The Company and its partner, AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates, "AbbVie"), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under the Company's collaboration for North America with AbbVie , total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie , are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between the Company and AbbVie . Additionally, development costs are shared equally between the Company and AbbVie.

Outside of the U.S., the Company earns royalties as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient by the Company's collaboration partners. AbbVie has an exclusive license from the Company to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan and the countries and territories of North America (the " AbbVie License Territory"). In addition, AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. Astellas Pharma Inc. ("Astellas"), the Company's partner in Japan, has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates) ("AstraZeneca"), the Company's partner in China, has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products containing linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the "AstraZeneca License Territory").

In June 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding AG ("VectivBio"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments for severe, rare GI conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need, at a price per share of $17.00, net to the shareholders of VectivBio in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the "VectivBio Acquisition"). In December 2023, the Company completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining outstanding ordinary shares in cash at a price per share of $17.00, and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ironwood organized under the laws of Switzerland (the "Squeeze-out Merger"). Through the acquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, for rare GI diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure ("SBS-IF"), a severe malabsorptive condition. In February 2024, the Company announced positive topline results from its pivotal Phase III clinical trial, STARS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous apraglutide in reducing parenteral support dependency in adult patients with SBS-IF, and plans to submit a new drug application and other regulatory filings for apraglutide for use in adult patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support.

The Company has a collaboration and license option agreement (the "COUR Collaboration Agreement") with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. ("COUR"), a biotechnology company developing novel immune-

modifying nanoparticles to treat autoimmune diseases. The COUR Collaboration Agreement grants the Company an option (the "Option") to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP104, a potential treatment for primary biliary cholangitis ("PBC"), a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver.

These and other agreements are more fully described in Note 5, Collaboration, License and Other Agreements , to these condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome and endometriosis.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, the Company changed its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, the Company has dedicated a majority of its activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of its other product candidates.

## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Additionally, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company's annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 16, 2024 (the "2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K").

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position as of June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, its statements of stockholders' equity (deficit) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and its cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other subsequent interim period.

## Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024 include the accounts of Ironwood and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Securities Corporation, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, VectivBio AG, GlyPharma Therapeutic Inc. ("GlyPharma"), and VectivBio US, Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

For consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the outstanding shares, the Company records net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), respectively, equal to the percentage of the common stock ownership interest retained in such entities by the noncontrolling parties. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company's equity.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company's management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company's management evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. Estimates and assumptions in the condensed consolidated financial statements include those related to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions; revenue recognition; accounts receivable; useful lives of long-lived assets; impairment of long-

## Table of Contents

lived assets, including goodwill; valuation procedures for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; research and development expenses; contingencies; defined benefit pension liabilities; and share-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.

## Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not adopt any additional significant accounting policies.

## New Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 that had a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendment in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative ("ASU 2023-06"). The guidance in ASU 2023-06 aligns the disclosure and presentation requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification with the SEC's regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. Any amendments not removed by the SEC by June 30, 2027 will not become effective. The amendments adopted in ASU 2023-06 will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-06 may have on its disclosures in its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) ("ASU 2023-07") . The guidance in ASU 2023-07 expands prior reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") and details of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment's performance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is required to be applied retrospectively upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of annual income tax disclosures by requiring greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2023-09 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on its disclosures in its annual consolidated financial statements.

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective, are not expected to be applicable to the Company or have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements upon future adoption.

## 3. Acquisitions

As described in Note 1, Nature of Business , on June 29, 2023, the Company completed the VectivBio Acquisition. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company to acquire the shares accepted for payment was approximately $1.2 billion. The Company financed the acquisition through proceeds from the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined elsewhere below) and cash on hand.

The total purchase consideration for VectivBio is as follows (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| Cash consideration paid to selling shareholders  (1)                                               | $ 1,041,391   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options  (2) | 78,003        |
| Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants  (3)                                          | 3,720         |
| Transaction costs                                                                                  | 26,270        |
| Fair value of noncontrolling interest  (4)                                                         | 26,218        |
| Total purchase consideration                                                                       | $ 1,175,602   |

On December 12, 2023, the Company completed the Squeeze-out Merger and paid $26.3 million to acquire all remaining outstanding VectivBio Shares in cash. As of December 31, 2023, there was no remaining noncontrolling interest in VectivBio.

The VectivBio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations, because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identifiable in-process research and development ("IPR&D") asset, apraglutide, VectivBio's lead investigational asset. Apraglutide is a next-generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being developed for a range of rare GI diseases for the potential treatment of SBS-IF. The Company recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In accordance with the accounting for asset acquisitions, an entity that acquires IPR&D assets in an asset acquisition follows the guidance in ASC Topic 730 Research and Development , which requires that both tangible and intangible identifiable research and development assets with no alternative future use be allocated a portion of the consideration transferred and recorded as research and development expense at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 billion in acquired IPR&D expense related to the apraglutide IPR&D asset during the second quarter of 2023.

The following is the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company (in thousands):

|                                              | Assets acquired   |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Cash and cash equivalents                    | $ 123,340         |
| Prepaid expenses and other current assets    | 10,867            |
| Property and equipment                       | 126               |
| Intangible assets                            | 4,100             |
| Acquired in-process research and development | 1,090,449         |
| Total assets acquired                        | $ 1,228,882       |

| Other liabilities         | 15,903                |
| Total liabilities assumed | $ 53,280              |
| Net assets acquired       | $ 1,175,602           |

The Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, of which $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, an insignificant amount, were included in research and development expense, and $2.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were included in restructuring expense within the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $45.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $20.9 million were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, $14.8 million were included in research and development expense, and $9.6 million were included in restructuring expense within the Company's condensed consolidated statement of income (loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Acquisition-related expenses include direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the transaction, including integration-related professional services and employee retention-related benefits. Acquisition-related expenses exclude transaction costs included in the computation of total consideration paid.

Intangible assets are comprised of the assembled workforce and are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years. The Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.4 million of amortization expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized an insignificant amount of amortization expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The net carrying value of the assembled workforce was $3.3 million and $3.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Future annual amortization expense will be $0.8 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2024 through December 31, 2027 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2028.

## 4. Net Loss Per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

The outstanding securities set forth in the following table have been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable, as their effect would be anti-dilutive (in thousands):

There was no dilutive impact of the 2024 Convertible Notes (as defined below) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 because the Company had elected prior to the beginning of the period to settle the conversion of 2024 Convertible Notes, if any, with a combination settlement of a cash payment equal to the principal value of converted notes and shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the conversion value in excess of the principal value, if any (Note 9). Accordingly, interest expense was not removed from the numerator and there was no calculated spread added to the denominator because the average market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock during the period was not in excess of the conversion price.

## Linaclotide Agreements

## Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie

In September 2007, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of this collaboration agreement, the Company received an upfront licensing fee, equity investment, and development and regulatory milestones, and shares equally with AbbVie all development costs as well as net profits or losses from the development and sale of linaclotide in the U.S. In addition, the Company receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and funding any costs.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred $1.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, in total research and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred $2.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, in total research and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America. As a result of the research and development cost-sharing provisions of the linaclotide collaboration for North America, the Company incurred $2.9 million and $5.2 million in incremental research and development costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and incurred $3.1 million and $6.1 million in incremental research and development costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, to reflect the obligations of each party under the collaboration to bear 50% of the development costs incurred.

The Company and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. The Company receives50% of the net profits and bears 50% of the net losses from the commercial sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Net profits or net losses consist of net sales of LINZESS to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. LINZESS net sales are calculated and

recorded by AbbVie and may include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges, and other applicable deductions.

The Company evaluated its linaclotide collaboration arrangement for North America and concluded that all developmentperiod performance obligations had been satisfied as of September 2012. The Company has determined that there are three remaining commercial-period performance obligations, which include the sales detailing of LINZESS, participation in the joint commercialization committee, and approved additional trials. The consideration remaining includes cost reimbursements in the U.S. and net profit and loss sharing payments based on net sales in the U.S. Additionally, the Company receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. Royalties and net profit and loss sharing payments will be recorded as collaborative arrangements revenue or expense in the period earned, as these payments relate predominately to the license granted to AbbVie. The Company records royalty revenue in the period earned based on royalty reports from its partner, if available, or based on the projected sales and historical trends. The cost reimbursements received from AbbVie during the commercialization period will be recognized as earned in accordance with the right-to-invoice practical expedient, as the Company's right to consideration corresponds directly with the value of the services transferred during the commercialization period.

Under the Company's linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America, LINZESS net sales are calculated and recorded by AbbVie and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges, and other applicable deductions, as noted above. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis, and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. This treatment is in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition policy, given that the Company is not the primary obligor and does not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America. The Company relies on AbbVie to provide accurate and complete information related to net sales of LINZESS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in order to calculate its settlement payments to and from AbbVie and record collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized an $8.5 million and $38.0 million reduction to collaboration revenue, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates of sales reserves and allowances associated with governmental and contractual rebates. Excluding the changes in estimates, net loss per share - basic and net loss per share - diluted would each have been $0.03 for the three months endedJune 30, 2024, and would have been $0.13 and $0.12, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

The following table summarizes collaborative arrangements revenue from the linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America (in thousands):

## Apraglutide Agreements

## Development and Commercialization Agreement with AKP

In March 2022, VectivBio entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation ("AKP") in which VectivBio granted an exclusive license to AKP, with the right to sublicense in multiple tiers, to develop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan.

Pursuant to the terms of the development and commercialization agreement with AKP, VectivBio received an upfront payment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement) and development-related payments of JPY1,600 million in the aggregate ($13.1 million at date of agreement) and is eligible to receive development milestones of JPY 1,000 million ($8.2 million at date of agreement) and up to JPY 19,000 million ($155.8 million at date of agreement) of commercial and sales-based milestone payments. VectivBio is also eligible to receive payments in the commercial period for manufacturing supply equal to cost-plus manufacturing mark-up and tiered royalties of up to a mid-double-digit percentage on product sales continuing until the later of (i) expiration of regulatory exclusivity in Japan, or (ii) expiration of the last valid patent claim that provides exclusivity to apraglutide in Japan (the "Royalty Term"). The development and commercialization agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the Royalty Term.

The Company identified two performance obligations consisting of the (i) exclusive license for the development and commercialization of apraglutide in Japan and (ii) development activities for conducting global trials and sharing of associated development data necessary for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval in Japan. Each performance obligation was capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. The initial transaction price was allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company assessed that it provided a right to use the license as the license exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which it is granted and therefore, was satisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The development activities are being recognized over time as the Company performs development activities related to the global trials. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the development activities using an input method, according to the costs incurred, which in management's judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. Under the sales-or-usage-based royalty exception, revenue related to sales-based milestone payments and royalty payments will be recognized as the underlying sales occur.

Prior to the VectivBio Acquisition, VectivBio had received the upfront payment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement), development-related payments of JPY 1,100 million ($9.0 million at date of agreement), and development milestones of JPY 500 million ($4.1 million at date of agreement). Upon the acquisition of VectivBio on June 29, 2023, the Company assumed a contract liability for deferred revenue related to the development-related payments at its fair value of $4.3 million.

In April 2024, VectivBio received the final development-related payment of JPY 500 million ($4.1 million at date of agreement).

The Company recognized $0.6 million and $1.3 million of revenue related to development activities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and an insignificant amount during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, deferred revenue of $2.1 million is reported within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $2.4 million is reported within other liabilities (Note 8) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

## 6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The tables below present information about the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize

observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions for the asset or liability.

The Company's investment portfolio may include fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis. As a result, the pricing services used by the Company apply other available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark yields, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. These models take into consideration relevant credit information, perceived market movements, sector news and economic events. The inputs into these models may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other relevant data. The Company validates the prices provided by its third-party pricing services by obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The Company periodically invests in certain reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized by Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their principal amount. The Company does not record an asset or liability for the collateral as the Company is not permitted to sell or re-pledge the collateral. The collateral has at least the prevailing credit rating of U.S. Government Treasuries and Agencies. The Company utilizes a third-party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure the collateral received is maintained at 102% of the reverse repurchase agreements principal amount on a daily basis.

The Company received net proceeds of $391.0 million from the sale of the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of $9.0 million. The Company used $25.2 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the Capped Calls, as described below.

In June 2024, the Company repaid the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes upon maturity. The 2024 Convertible Notes bore cash interest at the annual rate of 0.75% payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. No conversions were exercised by holders of the 2024 Convertible Notes.

The 2026 Convertible Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of1.50%, payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased.

The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes is74.6687 shares of Class A Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.39 per share.

The Company will settle conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A Common Stock, at the Company's option (subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the Indenture).

Holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025 in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:

- ● during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day;

- ● during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the "trading price" (as defined in each Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or
- ● upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture.

On or after December 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding June 15, 2026, the holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may convert their 2026 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, regardless of the foregoing conditions.

Upon the occurrence of fundamental changes, as described in the Indenture, prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Convertible Notes, holders of such notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a makewhole fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, occurs and a holder elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change, such holder may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate as described in the Indenture.

The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrict the Company's ability to repurchase the Company's securities, pay dividends or make restricted payments in the event of a transaction that substantially increases the Company's level of indebtedness. The Indenture provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs or is continuing, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare the principal amount of such notes to be immediately due and payable.

The Company accounts for convertible debt instruments as a single liability measured at amortized cost.

In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Company incurred $9.0 million of debt issuance costs, which primarily consisted of initial purchaser's discounts and legal and other professional fees. The debt issuance costs are reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of the convertible senior notes and recorded as interest expense over the life of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes.

The Company determined the expected life of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes was equal to their approximately five and seven-year terms, respectively. The effective annual interest rate of the 2024 Convertible Notes for the period from the date of issuance through maturity was 1.2%. The effective annual interest rate of the 2026 Convertible Notes for the period from the date of issuance through June 30, 2024 was 1.9%. The effective annual interest rate is computed using the contractual interest and the amortization of debt issuance costs.

## Capped Calls with Respect to 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes

To minimize the impact of potential dilution to the Company's Class A common stockholders upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Company separately entered into the capped call transactions in August 2019 (the "Capped Calls") in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Company paid the counterparties $25.2 million to enter into the Capped Calls, of which $25.0 million related to the premium payments and $0.2 million related to transaction costs. These instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC 815 to be classified in stockholders' equity and are not subsequently remeasured as long as the conditions for equity classification continue to be met.

The Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, which covered14,933,740 shares of Class A Common Stock, terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2024.

The Capped Calls in connection with the 2026 Convertible Notes have an initial strike price of approximately $13.39 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments generally similar to those applicable to the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls have a cap price of approximately $17.05 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover 14,933,740 shares of Class A Common Stock (subject to anti-dilution and certain other adjustments), which is the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock that initially underlie the 2026 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Calls.

The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of Class A Common Stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Calls as adjusted pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price per share of Class A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would nevertheless be dilution upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls.

## Revolving Credit Facility

In May 2023, in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, a letter of credit issuer and a lender, and the other agents, lenders and letter of credit issuers parties thereto.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a four-year $500.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and loans made thereunder will mature on the earliest to occur of (i) May 21, 2027 or (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of the Company's existing convertible notes then outstanding, unless, in the case of clause (ii), the Company's minimum liquidity equals or exceeds certain agreed levels.

At the Company's election, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to (a) Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Adjusted Term SOFR") (as defined in Revolving Credit Agreement) plus the applicable rate (ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%) or (b) the highest of (1) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus one half of 1.0%, (2) the prime lending

rate or (3) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.0% in effect from time to time plus the applicable rate (ranging from0.75% to 2.00%). The applicable rates are based on the Company's consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility) at the time of the applicable borrowing.

The Company pays a quarterly commitment fee of 0.30% to 0.425% on the daily amount by which the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement exceed the outstanding loans and letters of credit.

The loans and other obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's personal property, including a pledge of all the capital stock of subsidiaries held directly by the Company or any subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Agreement following the closing date (which pledge, in the case of any foreign subsidiary, is limited to 65% of the voting stock), subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. The Revolving Credit Agreement generally prohibits any other liens on the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company will be able to request an increase in the commitments or the addition of a term loan secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral of up to an additional amount equal to the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the trailing twelve-month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), and commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the Company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows the Company to elect to increase the permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters in the event it consummates an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50.0 million, subject to certain limitations on how often this election can be made. As of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

In connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company incurred $2.9 million of debt issuance costs, which primarily consisted of $2.0 million of lender fees and $0.9 million of legal and other professional fees. The debt issuance costs are classified as other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company had unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.1 million and $2.4 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

In June 2023, the Company borrowed $400.0 million to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition. The outstanding principal balance on the revolving credit facility was $425.0 million and $300.0 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

In connection with the VectivBio Acquisition, the Company incurred$2 7.5 million of share-based compensation expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 related to the vesting acceleration and settlement of outstanding VectivBio stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, of which $11 .3 million was recorded within research and development expense and $ 16.2 million was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.

## 11. Income Taxes

The income tax provision during interim periods is computed by applying an estimated annual U.S. effective income tax rate to U.S. year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring items, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-270, Income Taxes - Interim Reporting . Year-to-date pre-tax net loss generated in Switzerland is not included in the interim period income tax provision, as the related deferred tax assets are reserved in full by a valuation allowance.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 the Company recorded income tax expense of $19.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $13.3 million and $33.4 million, respectively. Due to the Company's ability to offset its pre-tax income against net operating losses, the majority of its tax provision is expected to represent a non-cash expense until its net operating losses have been fully utilized.

The Company continues to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in Switzerland, as well as U.S. federal and state tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization. On a periodic basis, the Company reassesses the valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets.

## 12. Workforce Reductions and Restructuring

In April 2023, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately10% of its headquarters-based personnel in an effort to further strengthen the operational efficiency of the organization. The workforce reduction was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2023. The Company recorded $3.5 million of restructuring expenses and adjustments, which are primarily comprised of employee severance, benefits and related costs, during each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

In June 2023, the Company commenced the elimination of certain positions in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. The majority of the eliminations were substantially completed during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred $2.1 million and $2.5 million of restructuring expenses, respectively, which are comprised primarily of employee severance, benefits, and related costs.

## Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

## Forward-Looking Information

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on February 16, 2024, or the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under "Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

## Overview

We are a gastrointestinal, or GI, healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.

LINZESS$^{®}$ (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists, or GC-C agonists, and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation, or FC. LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia, adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China, and pediatric patients ages 6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA$^{®}$ to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.

We have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in the U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, in Japan.

We also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional treatment options to GI patients.

In June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding AG, or the VectivBio Acquisition. In December 2023, we completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining shares and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with $400.0 million of borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 9, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Through the acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, for rare gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure, or SBS-IF, as well as several earlier stage assets.

In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration Agreement, with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that grants us an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing immune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC.

We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis.

## Table of Contents

To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded net loss of $0.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded net loss of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee that our company will be able to maintain positive cash flows.

We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We operate in one reportable business segment-human therapeutics.

## Financial Operations Overview

Revenues. Our revenues are generated primarily through our collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to research and development and commercialization of linaclotide.

The majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. We record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between AbbVie and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, or Chinese markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval and is commercialized.

Research and Development Expense. The core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases to bring multiple medicines to patients. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the research into and development of products and product candidates. These expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, and licensing fees for our product candidates.

Research and development expenses include amounts owed to AbbVie on an ongoing basis under cost-sharing provisions in our collaboration agreement for linaclotide. Reimbursements received for research and development activities under this agreement are netted against research and development expenses.

Linaclotide. Our commercial product, LINZESS, is commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C or CIC in adults and for FC in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Linaclotide is also available to adult men and women suffering from IBSC or CIC in certain countries of the world, including China, Japan, and in a number of European countries.

We and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020, based on the Phase IIIb data of linaclotide 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in adult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our supplemental new drug application to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label.

In addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved

prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.

Apraglutide for SBS-IF. In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from our pivotal Phase III clinical trial, STARS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous apraglutide in reducing parenteral support, or PS, dependency in adult patients with SBS-IF. SBS-IF, a rare and severe organ failure condition in which patients are dependent on PS, affects an estimated 18,000 adult patients in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Based on these results, we plan to submit a new drug application and other regulatory filings as a once-weekly GLP-2 analog for apraglutide for use in adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS.

Apraglutide for aGvHD. In March 2024, we announced positive, primary results up to Day 91 for our Phase II exploratory trial, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute Graft versus Host Disease, or aGvHD, which evaluated the safety and tolerability of once-weekly apraglutide in aGvHD patients treated with standard of care, including systemic corticosteroids and ruxolitinib. The STARGAZE study will continue through its two-year endpoint, where apraglutide will be re-evaluated for safety and efficacy.

CNP-104. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104. COUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients. Enrollment is complete and topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2024.

IW-3300. We are developing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including IC/BPS and endometriosis. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy volunteers and are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.

Early research and development. Our early research and development efforts have been focused on supporting our development stage GI programs, including exploring strategic options for further development of certain of our internal programs, as well as evaluating external development-stage GI programs.

The following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses relate primarily to compensation, benefits and other employeerelated expenses and external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs for our product candidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development support services and certain other costs directly to programs.

We cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for additional indications, populations or formulations.

Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them.

As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide's utility will be expanded within its currently approved indications; if or when linaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, apraglutide or any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.

We invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets.

The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:

- ● The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate;
- ● The U.S. FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures;
- ● Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;
- ● The duration and cost of early research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials, may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict;
- ● The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable, and, even if approved, a product may face post-approval development and regulatory requirements;
- ● There may be substantial costs, delays and difficulties in successfully integrating externally developed product candidates into our business operations; and
- ● The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us.

As a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and under "Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate's commercial potential.

We expect to invest in our development programs and incur substantial research and development expenses for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide, including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its currently approved indications, and the exploration of its potential utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will continue to invest in our GI-focused product candidates, including apraglutide, as

we advance them through pre-clinical and clinical trials, in addition to funding research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Asset acquisition costs, license fees and development milestone payments related to acquired and in-licensed products and technology are expensed as acquired in-process research and development at the point that they have no established alternative future use.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of LINZESS, apraglutide and other product candidates, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future.

We include AbbVie's selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.

Restructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses pertain to restructuring initiatives in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition and are more fully described in Note 12, Workforce Reductions and Restructuring.

Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of debt issuance costs.

Interest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, as well as significant financing components of payments due from collaboration partners.

Gain on Derivatives. Gain on derivatives consists of the change in fair value of note hedge warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry in April 2023. Refer to Note 9, Debt , in the financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the note hedge warrants.

Income Taxes. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the income tax accounting rules and each jurisdiction's enacted tax laws and regulations. At interim reporting dates, we record our income tax provision by applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring items.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Results of Operations

The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Collaborative Arrangements Revenue. The decrease in collaborative arrangements revenue of $13 .0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily related to a $13.3 million decrease in our share of net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was driven by decreased net price (including an $8.5 million reduction to collaboration revenue as a result of changes in estimates of sales reserves and allowances associated with governmental and contractual rebates), partially offset by increases from prescription demand and inventory channel fluctuations.

The decrease in collaborative arrangements revenue of $42. 2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily related to a $43. 3 million decrease in our share of net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was driven by decreased net price (including a $38.0 million reduction to collaboration revenue as a result of changes in estimates of sales reserves and allowances associated with governmental and contractual rebates), partially offset by increases from prescription demand and inventory channel fluctuations.

Research and Development Expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses of $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily related to $11.3 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million in related payroll taxes recognized in the second quarter of 2023 immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and a $6.0 million payment to COUR in the second quarter of 2023 related to CNP-104 in connection with the amendment of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, partially offset by a $13.2 million increase in external apraglutide costs, a $2.0 million increase related to an agreement with COUR to increase the CNP-104 clinical study budget, and a $1.7 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses.

The increase in research and development expenses of $8.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily related to a $27.0 million increase in external apraglutide costs, a $5.8 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses, and a $2.0 million increase related to an agreement with COUR to increase the CNP-104 clinical study budget, partially offset by $11.3 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million in related payroll taxes recognized in the second quarter of 2023 immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, a $6.0 million payment to COUR in the second quarter of 2023 related to CNP-104 in connection with the amendment of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, and a $4.8 million reduction to research and development expense in connection with the settlement of a license-related contract liability.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $15.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to $16.2 million of sharebased compensation expense and $3.0 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in professional services costs (including $2.3 million related to the commercial launch of apraglutide, if approved).

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to $16.2 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.0 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio's 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by a $5.9 million increase in professional services costs (including $5.1 million related to the commercial launch of apraglutide, if approved), and a $3.3 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses.

Restructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses during each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 include restructuring initiatives that commenced in June 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition and restructuring expenses during each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 include a headquarters-based workforce reduction that commenced in April 2023.

Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense increased by $5.6 million for three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million of interest expense incurred under the revolving credit facility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.

Interest expense increased by $11.3 million for six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of $11.7 million of interest expense incurred under the revolving credit facility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.

Interest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income decreased by $7.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and investment balances following the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.

Interest and investment income decreased by $13.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and investment balances following the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.

Gain on Derivatives. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an insignificant gain on derivatives resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our note hedge warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry during April 2023.

Income Tax Expense. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of $19.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $13.3 million and $33.4 million, respectively. Due to our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset federal taxable income and taxable income in most states, the majority of our tax provision will be a non-cash expense until our net operating losses have been fully utilized.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2024, we had $105.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts held in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. We invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in certain types of investments and requires all investments held by us to be at least A- rated, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of less than twenty-four months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation objectives.

We anticipate our cash balance and our expected net cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our near-term and long-term cash obligations, which are reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our most significant fixed obligations are debt obligations and lease commitments, for which annual payments are disclosed in Note 9, Debt , and Note 7, Leases , respectively, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.

Such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.

## Sources of Liquidity

We have financed our operations to date primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public sale of our common stock, debt financings, and cash generated from our operations. As of June 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, due in 2026, and $425.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we entered into in May 2023 to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for $500.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Refer to Note 9, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to our debt obligations.

## Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting net income (loss) for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in the results of operations.

Net cash inflows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $33.5 million and $78.5 million, respectively, and were derived primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. Net cash inflows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were $35.0 million and $115.1 million, respectively, and were primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.

primarily of a repayment of $200.0 million aggregate principal on the 2024 Convertible Notes upon maturity in June 2024, partially offset by $125.0 million of net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $10.8 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases.

Cash provided by financing activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 totaled $399.1 million and $403.1 million, respectively, and was generated primarily from the incurrence of $400.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of costs, in the second quarter of 2023, as well as $1.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan.

## Funding Requirements

We began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, in the fourth quarter of 2012, and we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this collaboration. Our goal is to generate and maintain positive cash flows, driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and other commercial activities and financial discipline, while continuing to invest in the development and commercialization of linaclotide, apraglutide, and other product candidates.

Under our collaboration with AbbVie for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and AbbVie. Additionally, we receive royalties from AbbVie based on sales of linaclotide in its licensed territories outside of the U.S. We believe revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with AbbVie will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues from our other commercial activities, will continue to enable us to generate positive cash flows, or to do so in the timeframes we expect. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., develop and commercialize other products, including apraglutide, and invest in building our pipeline through internal or external opportunities, including potential payments associated with exercising the option under the COUR Collaboration Agreement. We believe that our cash on hand as of June 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.

Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations, including the underlying revenue expectations and estimates regarding the costs to continue to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., as well as our expectations regarding revenue from Astellas for Japan and AstraZeneca for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and our goal to generate and maintain positive cash flows, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary materially and negatively from these and other forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed under the headings "Note Regarding ForwardLooking Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under "Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide, apraglutide and our other product candidates, in each case, for all of the markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each is suited. Our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

- ● the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS and CONSTELLA and from any other sources;
- ● the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing and selling LINZESS in the U.S. and from any other sources;
- ● the success of our third-party manufacturing activities;
- ● the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, including apraglutide, as well as the timing and cost of any post-approval development and regulatory requirements;

## Table of Contents

- ● the time and cost associated with integrating VectivBio's business and assets into our business operations;
- ● the time and costs associated with commercial manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of apraglutide, if approved;
- ● the success of our research and development efforts;
- ● the emergence of competing or complementary products;
- ● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
- ● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish, including milestones, royalties or other payments due or payable under such agreements;
- ● the settlement method used for our outstanding convertible notes; and
- ● the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions, as well as the cost and timing of evaluating, acquiring, and, if completed, integrating into our business operations any such assets.

## Financing Strategy

We may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements, strategic alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

## New Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We did not otherwise adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 that had a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

## Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, including collateralized reverse repurchase agreements, and money market instruments, as well as commercial paper. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk.

Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the primarily short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 1% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Accordingly, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio.

We do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash

## Table of Contents

and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits.

Our convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if our credit rating improves or other circumstances change.

We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our four-year secured $500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The increase or decrease in annual interest expense resulting from a 10% increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate is $3.1 million.

## Equity Price Risk

Our convertible senior notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our Class A Common Stock at conversion or maturity of the notes. The amount of cash we may be required to pay is determined by the price of our Class A Common Stock. The fair value of our convertible senior notes is dependent on the price and volatility of our Class A Common Stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes.

To minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes, we entered into the capped call transactions with respect to the 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2026.

The convertible notes and derivatives are more fully described in Note 9, Debt, in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Foreign Currency Risk

We are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our foreign operations. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' respective functional currencies. We are also exposed to unfavorable fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency has not had, nor do we believe that a decrease or increase in any foreign currency exchange rates would have, a material impact on our results of operations.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required

## Table of Contents

to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Based on management's evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that no changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On June 29, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VectivBio and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we excluded VectivBio from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion was in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year form the date of acquisition. We have extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls and procedures, to the acquired operations of VectivBio, and we will incorporate VectivBio into our annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
