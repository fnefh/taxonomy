We generally supply our products to OEMs through their co ntract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors.

We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human experience semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions.

Sales and Marketing
-------------------

We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process.

As of the end of fiscal 2022, we employed 228 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the U.S., Taiwan, China, India, Korea, and Japan. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors that are primarily located in the U.S., China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Germany.

International sales constituted over 98% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. Approximately 66%, 68%, and 78% of our sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major IoT, notebook computer, and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Manufacturing
-------------

We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom module products or processed as our ASIC-based solution.

After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom product solutions or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products.

We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment.

Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. In some cases, we have alternative sources of suppliers to mitigate supplier risk; however, in the current environment, all of them could be constrained. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any single source of supply.

Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand declines.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
---------------------

You should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this report, in evaluating our company and our business.

Risks Related to Our Markets and Customers
------------------------------------------

We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue, and any downturn in sales of these products would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We currently depend on our solutions for the IoT, PC, and mobile product applications markets for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in sales of our products into any of these markets would adversely affect our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, a softening of demand in any of these markets, or a slowdown of growth in any of these markets because of changes in customer preferences, the emergence of applications not including our solutions, or other factors would cause our business, operating results, and financial position to suffer.

A significant portion of our sales comes from one or more large customers, the loss of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we lost key customers, or if key customers reduced or stopped placing orders for our high-volume products, our financial results could be adversely affected. Sales to two direct customers each accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we had four OEM customers that integrated our products into their products representing approximately 34% of our revenue; we sold to these customers primarily indirectly through multiple distributors. Significant reductions in sales to our largest customers, the loss of other major customers, or a general decrease in demand for our products within a short period of time could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and business.

We sell to contract manufacturers that serve our OEM customers. Any material delay, cancellation, or reduction of orders from any one or more of these contract manufacturers or the OEMs they serve could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. The adverse effect could be more substantial if our other customers do not increase their orders or if we are unsuccessful in generating orders for our solutions with new customers. Many of these contract manufacturers sell to the same OEMs, and therefore our concentration with certain OEMs may be higher than with any individual contract manufacturer. Concentration in our customer base may make fluctuations in revenue and earnings more severe and make business planning more difficult.

We are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets that may result in fluctuations in our operating results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The consumer electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, production overcapacity, and increased inventory and credit risk. In addition, the consumer electronics industry is cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.

We cannot assure you that our product solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our product solutions may not be successful in new markets. Various target markets for our product solutions, such as IoT, may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products.

Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following:

* ·the development and growth of these markets;
* ·the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets, the price and performance requirements of OEMs, and the preferences of end users; and
* ·our ability to provide OEMs with solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions.

Many manufacturers of these products have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success in these markets will require us to offer better performance alternatives to other solutions at competitive costs. The failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings and a restructuring of our operations. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future.

If we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or our customers' products that utilize our solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not sell any products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our solutions. Instead, we design various solutions that our OEM customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on such OEM customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our solutions and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our OEM customers' products that incorporate our solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers' price and performance goals, our sales could decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our solutions.

We must maintain our relationships with our existing customers and expand our relationships with OEMs in new markets. Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay, subject to certain limitations. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue.

In addition to maintaining and expanding our customer relationships, we must also identify areas of significant growth potential in other markets, establish relationships with OEMs in those markets, and assist those OEMs in developing products that incorporate our solutions. Our failure to identify potential growth opportunities in the markets in which we operate, particularly in the IoT market, or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with OEMs in those markets, would prevent our business from growing in those markets.

Risks Related to Our Supply Chain
---------------------------------

We depend on third parties to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and delivery schedules, and their inability to do so could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, and result in our inability to deliver our products, which would adversely affect our operating results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We depend on our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to maintain high levels of productivity and satisfactory delivery schedules at manufacturing and assembly facilities located primarily in Asia. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We generally do not, however, have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. In our fiscal 2022, we faced manufacturing capacity constraints as a result of the supply constraints and capacity shortages

affecting the global semiconductor industry that materially limited our ability to meet our customers' demand forecasts, thereby limiting our potential revenue growth during the fiscal year. As a result of the supply shortages, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with certain of our suppliers. If end customer demand declines, these long-term capacity agreements could result in significant write-downs of inventory. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources and reduce our margins. Although we have been able to obtain increased production capacity from our third-party contract manufacturers in the past, there is no guarantee that our contract manufacturers will be able to increase production capacity to enable us to meet our customer demands in the future. Our contract manufacturers also serve other customers, a number of which have greater production requirements than we do. As a result, our contract manufacturers could determine to prioritize production capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice.

Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. We may also encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase our costs or disrupt our supply of such products. The loss of relationships with our contract manufacturers or assemblers, or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for us as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect our ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and adversely affect our operating results.

Shortages of components and materials may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our operating results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. In most cases, neither we nor our contract manufacturers have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. As a result, we are subject to increased costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our customers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products into which our product solutions are incorporated. Supply shortages in our fiscal 2022 have resulted in increased product costs, not all of which we passed on to our customers. Future shortages of materials and components, including potential supply constraints of silicon, could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction, which may result in lower revenue.

Risks Related to Product Development
------------------------------------

We are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles, which can result in development and engineering costs without any future revenue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide solutions that are incorporated by OEMs into the products they sell. OEMs make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our solutions or pursue other alternatives. This process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources in the design of solutions for our OEMs' products well before our customers introduce their products incorporating our interface solutions into the market, and before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment. During a customer's entire product development process, we face the risk that our interfaces will fail to meet our customer's technical, performance, or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if we complete our design process in a manner satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which could adversely affect our operating results.

We face intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We serve intensely competitive markets that are characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, and competition from major domestic and international companies. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Depressed economic conditions, a slowdown in the markets in which we operate, the emergence of new products not including our product solutions, rapid changes in the markets in which we operate, and competitive pressures may result in lower demand for our product solutions and reduced unit margins.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Some of our competitors have greater market recognition, larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them greater competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, negotiate lower prices for raw materials and components, deliver competitive products at lower prices, and introduce new product solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can. Our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers determine not to utilize our custom engineered, total solutions approach and instead, decide to design and manufacture their own interfaces, contract with our competitors, or use alternative technologies.

If we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We operate in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we may be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to enhancing and developing new technology, which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential solutions.

Our research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and operating results.

We may not be able to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions in a timely manner.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide new solutions that compare favorably with alternative solutions on the basis of time to introduction, cost, performance, and end user preferences. Our success in maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, and developing new business depends on various factors, including the following:

* ·innovative development of new solutions for customer products;
* ·utilization of advances in technology;
* ·maintenance of quality standards;
* ·performance advantages;
* ·efficient and cost-effective solutions; and
* ·timely completion of the design and introduction of new solutions.

Our inability to enhance our existing product solutions and develop new product solutions on a timely basis could harm our operating results and impede our growth.

If we become subject to product returns or claims resulting from defects in our products, we may incur significant costs resulting in a decrease in revenue.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery. Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products. Synaptics handles product quality matters sustainably by working on a one-on-one basis with our customers. We have never formally recalled a product or had a mass defect that affected an entire product line. Nevertheless, manufacturing errors or product

defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance. Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts.

We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development. Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results.

From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer. If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following: (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of convertible notes or additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

Risks Related to International Sales and Operations
---------------------------------------------------

Changes to import, export and economic sanction laws may expose us to liability, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers, suppliers or contract manufacturers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customer, supplier, or contract manufacturer. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could material and adversely affect our business and operating results.

In addition, compliance with additional export regulations may result in increased costs to the company. Although we have an export compliance program, maintaining and adapting our export controls program to new and shifting regulations is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. Failure to comply with trade or economic sanctions could subject the company to legal liabilities and fines from the U.S. government. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.

Changes to international trade policy and rising concerns of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the U.S. and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the materials used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of foreign suppliers, particularly suppliers located in Asia. The imposition of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials could make it more difficult or expensive for us or our OEMs to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials necessary for the production of our products or products which incorporate our product solutions. Any interruptions to supply could result in delay or cancellation of our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

In addition, the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China carry the risk that China's overall economic condition may be negatively affected, which could affect our China operations, including the manufacturing operations on which we rely in China. Further, imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or to our OEMs selling to customers in China, which could impact our business, revenue, and operating results.

International sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our manufacturing and assembly operations are primarily conducted in Taiwan, China, and Korea by contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators. We have sales and logistics operations in Hong Kong, and sales and engineering design support operations in China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.K. These international operations expose us to various economic, political, regulatory, and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following:

* ·difficulties and costs of staffing and managing a multinational organization;
* ·unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
* ·differing labor regulations;
* ·differing environmental laws and regulations, including in response to climate change;
* ·potentially adverse tax consequences;
* ·possible employee turnover or labor unrest;
* ·greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;
* ·the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;
* ·the volatility of currency exchange rates;
* ·potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;
* ·political or economic instability in certain parts of the world; and
* ·natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis.

If any of these risks associated with international operations materialize, our operations could significantly increase in cost or be disrupted, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results.

Our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, and we invoice and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. In the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. For fiscal 2022, approximately 13% of our costs were denominated in non-U.S. currencies, including British pounds, Canadian dollars, European Union euro, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupee, New Taiwan dollars, Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, Polish zloty, Israeli New Shekel, and Swiss francs.

If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation could result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.

Risks Related to Our Employees
------------------------------

We depend on key personnel who would be difficult to replace, and our business will likely be harmed if we lose their services or cannot hire additional qualified personnel.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. The competition for qualified management and key personnel, especially engineers, is intense. Although we maintain nondisclosure covenants with most of our key personnel, and our key executives have change of control severance agreements, we do not have employment agreements with many of them. The loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, especially engineers and technical support personnel, and capable sales and customer-support employees outside the U.S., could delay the development and sale of our products, disrupt our business, and interfere with our ability to execute our business plan.

If we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of share-based compensation award programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of our share-based compensation programs or additional shares for such programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
------------------------------------------

Our ability to compete successfully and continue growing as a company depends on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Further, there can be no assurance that even if a patent is issued, that it will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could compromise our ability to fully protect our trademarks and brands and could increase the risk of challenge from third parties to our use of our trademarks and brands. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are still evolving and historically, have not protected and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws developed in the U.S.

We do not consistently rely on written agreements with our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products and therefore, some trade secret protection may be lost and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in place may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies or may be breached by other parties. Additionally, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and other recipients of our technologies and products may seek to use our technologies and products without appropriate limitations. In the past, we did not consistently require our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, employment, or proprietary information and invention assignment agreements. Therefore, our former employees and consultants may try to claim some ownership interest in our technologies and products or may use our technologies and products competitively and without appropriate limitations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our technologies and

products that we regard as proprietary. Other companies, including our competitors, may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies, or design around our patents. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our technologies and products.

We may pursue, and from time to time defend, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Any claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third-party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third-party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology.

In addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms.

If third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third-party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Risks Related to Acquisitions
-----------------------------

Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses.

We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following:

* ·the potential disruption of our core business;
* ·the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures;
* ·potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business;
* ·costs relating to liabilities which we agree to assume;
* ·unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;
* ·diversion of management's attention from our core business;
* ·problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products;
* ·risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience;
* ·failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results;
* ·adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;
* ·failure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses;
* ·the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and
* ·the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems.

We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business.

Potential strategic alliances may not achieve their objectives, and the failure to do so could impede our growth.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances. We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology. Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated. The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets.

We may incur material environmental liabilities as a result of prior operations at an acquired company.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In connection with our acquisition in July 2017 of Conexant Systems, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned and operated by Conexant (the "Conexant Site") and for potential future claims alleging personal injury or property damage related to the environmental impacts at and about the Conexant Site. We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site's environmental impacts, and we are at risk for future personal injury and property damage claims related to the Conexant Site. Various federal, state, and local authorities regulate the release of hazardous substances into the environment and can impose substantial fines if our remediation efforts at or about the Conexant Site fail or are deemed inadequate. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination at the Conexant Site, the implementation of new technology at the Conexant Site, or the establishment or imposition of stricter federal, state, or local cleanup standards or requirements with respect to the Conexant Site could require us to incur additional costs in the future that could have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Factors Related to Our Indebtedness
-----------------------------------------

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement, our 4.000% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On March 11, 2021, we completed the offering of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, with a corresponding amendment and restatement of our credit agreement, or as amended and supplemented, the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Senior Notes include a mandatory semi-annual payment of a 4.000% coupon. We are permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify.

| Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including: |
| --- |
| ·making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Notes, the Credit Agreement, or our other outstanding debt from time to time; |
| ·risking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Notes indenture or the Credit Agreement, which could result in the Senior Notes or any outstanding bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to |
| foreclose on the assets securing such bank debt; |
| ·subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt that we may incur under the Credit Agreement; |
| ·the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023 and the replacement rate could be more volatile or more costly, resulting in a higher cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement; |
| ·reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; |
| ·limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and |
| ·placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. |

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior Notes or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.

The covenants in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make investments; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v) sell assets; (vi) pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix) enter into certain restrictive agreements; and (x) engage in a new line of business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (ii) require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level.

If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more

difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.

General Risk Factors
--------------------

Our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Any of these public health threats and related consequences could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

COVID-19 has spread rapidly and enveloped most of the world, causing a global public health crisis . In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Governments in affected countries continue to periodically impose travel bans, quarantines, and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial lockdown measures. These restrictions, and prevention and mitigation measures, have had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in market turmoil, which could also negatively impact our business, financial condition, and cash flows.

These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may be located in areas more severely or repeatedly impacted by COVID-19 and its variants, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our infrastructure, management, and resources could be strained, our ability to effectively manage our business could be diminished, and our operating results could suffer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The failure to manage our planned growth effectively could strain our resources, which would impede our ability to increase revenue. We have increased the number of our solutions in the past and may plan to further expand the number and diversity of our solutions and their use in the future. Our ability to manage our planned diversification and growth effectively will require us to:

* ·successfully hire, train, retain, and motivate additional employees, including employees outside the U.S.;
* ·efficiently plan, expand, or cost-effectively reduce our facilities to meet headcount requirements;
* ·enhance our global operational, financial, and management infrastructure; and
* ·expand our development and production capacity.

In connection with the expansion and diversification of our product and customer base, we may increase our personnel and make other expenditures to meet demand for our expanding product offerings, including offerings in the IoT market, the PC applications market, and the mobile product applications market. Any increase in expenses or investments in infrastructure and facilities in anticipation of future orders that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. Our customers also may require rapid increases in design and production services that place an excessive short-term burden on our resources and the resources of our contract manufacturers. An inability to quickly expand our development, design or production capacity or an inability of our third-party manufacturers to quickly expand development, design, or production capacity to meet this customer demand could result in a decrease to our revenue or operating results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could suffer.

We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks.
----------------------------------------------------------------

We face risks associated with security breaches or cyberattacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, ransomware, and other attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company, our employees and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: liability for stolen assets or information; fines imposed on us by governmental authorities for failure to comply with privacy laws or for disclosure of any personally identifiable information as a part of such attack; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyberattack. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyberattack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, we are required to pay U.S. federal taxes on the operating earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows.

We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect, use, and store personally identifiable information, or PII, as part of our business and operations. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of PII. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. The theft, loss or misuse of PII collected, used, stored or transferred by us, our any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, including litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.

Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and discourage a takeover.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock. Delaware law also imposes conditions on

certain business combination transactions with "interested stockholders." Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election. The classification of directors tends to discourage a third-party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships. A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third-party's efforts in, replacing a majority of directors.

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following:

* ·variations in our quarterly results;
* ·the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;
* ·changes in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates;
* ·various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, our competitors, or a potential acquisition of our company;
* ·announcements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers;
* ·introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers;
* ·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or our customers;
* ·recruitment or departure of key personnel;
* ·the gain or loss of significant orders;
* ·the gain or loss of significant customers;
* ·market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole;
* ·short positions held by investors;
* ·new federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and
* ·general financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, and rivalries, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, health pandemics, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity.

In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies' operating performance. Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Information on Common Stock
----------------------------------

Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol "SYNA" since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock.

Stockholders
------------

As of August 12, 2022, there were approximately 120 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 12, 2022 was $146.75.

Dividends
---------

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make our debt payments, or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results, and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

Our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes also place restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes indenture, see Note 8 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Stock-Based Compensation
------------------------

For information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
-------------------------------------

From April 2005 through July 2021, our Board of Directors cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion for our common stock under our stock repurchase program, which expires in July 2025. As of the end of fiscal 2022, the remaining amount authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program was $577.4 million. During fiscal 2022, there were no repurchases under our stock repurchase program.

Performance Graph
-----------------

The following line graph compares cumulative total stockholder returns for the five years ended June 25, 2022 for (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index and (iii) the Russell 2000 Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2017. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index include reinvestment of dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results
--------------------------------------------------------------

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Impact of COVID-19
------------------

Although many of these restrictions and other containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 and its variants have resulted in a variety of responses in the many geographic locations in which we do business, from no actions taken to and up to and including the re-imposition of lockdowns and containment measures designed to mitigate or reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants.

The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority, and a large number of our workforce has been vaccinated. Many of our employees that worked from home at the onset of COVID-19, or during subsequent lockdowns, have returned full-time or on a hybrid basis to our office environment. For those employees that have returned to the office, we continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations.

To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread and vaccinate large portions of the population. However, if more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, we, our customer, and our suppliers could experience renewed and sustained business disruption.

We will continue to evaluate the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to the ongoing pandemic.

Overview
--------

We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.

We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. For fiscal 2022, revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 63.3% of our net revenue, revenue from the PC product applications market accounted for 19.7% of our net revenue, and revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 17.0% of our net revenue.

Many of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K., and the U.S., we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis.

Our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers' facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components

of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials; logistics; amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology; backlog; supplier arrangements; manufacturing, assembly, royalties paid to third-party intellectual property providers and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers; and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value, to cost of revenue.

Our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin.

Our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development, as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human experience solutions for OEM customers prior to and after our OEMs' commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. In addition, we expense in-process research and development projects acquired as part of a business acquisition, which have not yet reached technological feasibility, and which have no foreseeable alternative future use. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities.

Acquired intangibles amortization, included in operating expenses, consists primarily of amortization of customer relationship and tradenames intangible assets recognized under the purchase method for business combinations.

Restructuring costs primarily reflect severance costs related to the restructuring of our operations to reduce operating expenses and gain efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. These headcount related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 15 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets. See below under "Divestiture".

Interest and other expense, net, primarily reflects interest expense on our Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility and revolving line of credit as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Gain from sale of equity investment relates to our sale of our equity method investment in OXi Technology Ltd. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Acquisitions
------------

DSP Group, Inc.
---------------

On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSPG to acquire all of the equity of DSPG for $22.00 per share of common stock. The transaction closed on December 2, 2021, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $543.3 million. We financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and the Term Loan Facility. The results of DSPG are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from December 3, 2021 through June 25, 2022. For further discussion of the DSPG acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

DisplayLink
-----------

On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in highperformance video compression technology. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020 for an aggregate purchase consideration of $444.0 million. For further discussion of the DisplayLink acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Broadcom
--------

On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom's existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/global navigation satellite system, or GNSS, products and business in the IoT market, or the Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $250.0 million in cash that closed on July 23, 2020. We also entered into certain transition agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. For further discussion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition, see Note 4 Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Divestitures
------------

In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction, licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million.

In December 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third-party to sell the assets of our LCD, Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration, or TDDI, product line for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement for cash consideration of $138.7 million and had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction in April 2020. The gain on sale of this portion of a product line was $105.1 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
------------------------------------------

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity's most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity's financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of sale and estimate probable product warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue as the warranty is considered an assurance warranty and not a performance

obligation. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations.

Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty, and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer.

Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the new revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations within Other Accrued Liabilities as disclosed in Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities.

Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.

We invoice customers and recognize all of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis.

We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are owed after shipment.

Inventory
---------

We state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions.

Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors.

Business Combinations
---------------------

We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of a business acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including inprocess research and development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially recorded at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable intangible asset and amortized over the asset's estimated useful life. Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach that includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates. We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021
-------------------------------------

Net Revenue.
------------

Net revenue was $1,739.7 million for fiscal 2022 compared with $1,339.6 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $400.1 million, or 29.9%. Of our fiscal 2022 net revenue, $1,100.9 million, or 63.3% of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market, $343.0 million, or 19.7%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $295.8 million, or 17.0%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2022 was attributable to an increase of $488.0 million, or 79.6%, in net revenue from IoT product applications partially offset by a decrease of $11.7 million, or 3.3%, in net revenue from PC product applications and a decrease of $76.2 million, or 20.5%, in net revenue from mobile product applications. The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by a 45% increase in the units sold as well as a 23.9% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by a 17.0% decrease in the units sold, partially offset by a 16.4% increase in average selling prices. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a 21.4% decrease in the units sold, partially offset by a 1.2% increase in average selling prices.

Gross Margin.
-------------

Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 54.2%, or $943.1 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with 45.6%, or $611.2 million, for fiscal 2021. The 860 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix, product cost reductions, and a decrease in inventory fair value adjustments of $13.8 million, partially offset by a $7.5 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization charged to cost of revenue largely related to the acquisition of DSPG.

Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-byproduct basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.

Operating Expenses.
-------------------

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $53.9 million, to $367.3 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $24.3 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to a substantial increase in our stock price during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, which also increased the share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock plan. Payroll and variable compensation costs increased by $22.6 million, which includes costs associated with research and development headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $23.5 million, to $168.4 million, for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $14.7 million increase in share-based compensation primarily due to a substantial increase in our stock price during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, which also increased the share-based compensation associated with our phantom stock plan. Payroll and variable compensation costs increased by $11.1 million, which includes costs associated with selling, general and administrative headcount from our DSPG acquisition, which closed on December 2, 2021.

Acquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 7 Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations, improve efficiencies in our operational activities and gain synergies from acquisitions. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were $18.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively. See Note 15 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Gain on Sale of Audio Technology Assets. Gain on sale of audio technology assets includes the sale of certain intangible assets related to our audio products. See Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Non-Operating Income.
---------------------

Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net was $3.0 million for fiscal 2022 compared with $2.9 million for fiscal 2021.

Interest Expense. Interest expense was $30.2 million and $29.5 million, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $600 million Term Loan Facility issued in December 2021, interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes issued in March 2021, as well as interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on our $525 million principal amount convertible notes issued in June 2017 and settled in August 2021. See Note 8 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Loss on redemption of convertible notes . Loss on redemption of convertible notes represents the difference between fair value and the carrying value as of the redemption date of the convertible notes. The loss on redemption of convertible notes for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was $8.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

Gain from sale and leaseback transaction . Gain from sale and leaseback transaction represents the gain from the sale of our headquarters buildings and properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The gain from the sale and leaseback transaction for fiscal 2022 was $5.4 million.

Provision for Income Taxes.
---------------------------

Our income tax provision was $64.6 million in fiscal 2022 and $31.4 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in our income tax provision in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in foreign profits and associated taxes, offset by the increase in tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions and research and development credits. See "Note 13 Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $0.9 million to an increase of $6.9 million.

Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020.
--------------------------------------

For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, please refer to "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations" in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 23, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

Our cash and cash equivalents were $824.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 compared with $836.3 million as of the end of fiscal 2021, a decrease of $12.3 million. This decrease reflected cash flows provided by operating activities of $462.7 million and $14.3 million of cash provided by financing activities, offset by $482.7 million of cash used in investing activities.

We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2022, $624.0 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we will be able to repatriate these funds without any further impact on our tax provision.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2022, the $462.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $257.5 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

amortization of $123.5 million, share-based compensation costs of $100.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $24.0 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $24.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $19.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to an $81.1 million increase in accounts receivable, an increase of $65.1 million in inventories, an increase of $23.2 million in accounts payable, an increase of $48.6 million in income taxes payable and an increase of $17.4 million in other accrued liabilities. Our days sales outstanding was 61 days in fiscal 2022 as compared to 63 days in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turns decreased to four times in fiscal 2022 from seven times from fiscal 2021.

For fiscal 2021, the $319.2 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $79.6 million plus adjustments for noncash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $110.1 million, share-based compensation costs of $66.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $21.6 million, and a reduction of $34.2 million for gain on sale of audio technology assets, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $30.4 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $45.6 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $53.1 million decrease in inventories, a $32.2 million increase in accounts payable, and a $14.9 million increase in accrued compensation; partially offset by a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.2 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, and a $9.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 was $482.7 million and net cash provided by investing activities in 2021 was $522.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $501.1 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $31.1 million used for the purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by proceeds from sale and leaseback transaction of $55.9 million and $24.4 million in proceeds from sales of investments.

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of $626.5 million used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and $21.1 million used for the purchases of capital assets; partially offset by $95.8 million in proceeds from sales of investments and $34.2 million in proceeds from sale of audio technology assets. Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $138.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by $16.3 million used for the purchases of capital assets.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022 was $14.3 million and for fiscal 2021 was $274.1 million. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to $600.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt and $15.2 million in proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $3.0 million of payment on debt, $67.3 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, and $505.6 million used for payment for redemption of convertible notes.

Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to $400.0 million in proceeds from issuance of debt and $27.8 million in proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $100.0 million of payment on the line-of-credit borrowings, $28.2 million used for payroll taxes for restricted stock units, or RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, and $19.4 million used for payment for redemption of convertible notes. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to $100.0 million proceeds from borrowing under the line-of-credit and $34.5 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $30.2 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market and $9.7 million used for payroll taxes for RSUs, MSUs and PSUs.

For discussion related to the statement of cash flows for fiscal 2020, please refer to "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations" in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on August 21, 2020.

Common Stock Repurchase Program. As of the end of fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors had cumulatively authorized the purchase of up to an aggregate of $1.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program through July 2025. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased, and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2022, we purchased 31,749,195 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.2 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had $577.4 million, respectively, remaining under our common stock repurchase program.

Senior Debt. On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.

The Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.000% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities.

Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date:

| Year | Price |
| --- | --- |
| 2024 | 102 % |
| 2025 | 101 |
| 2026 and thereafter | 100 % |

In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us.

The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors' future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes.

The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company's or any parent's capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.

The Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Senior Notes.

Revolving Credit Facility. On March 11, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for

working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021 we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of the end of fiscal 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months.

Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions, who collectively with our company are referred to as the Credit Parties. The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties' direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.

The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale that ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR.

Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants that limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of the company and specified subsidiaries, and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants.

Term Loan Facility. In December 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance our DSPG acquisition and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum.

Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant.

The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds.

$100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

Working Capital Needs. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements and our debt service obligations, for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the effectiveness of vaccines on COVID-19 variants, including the deployment of those vaccines to help reduce the length, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.

Based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not currently anticipate the need to remit undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to meet our working capital and other cash requirements. While we have accrued taxes on almost all of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, if we did remit such earnings, we may be required to pay certain state and foreign taxes to repatriate these funds, which would impact our operating cash flows.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2022 (in millions):

|  | Payments due by period | Payments due by period | Payments due by period | Payments due by period | Payments due by period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contractual Obligations | Total | Less than 1 year | 1-3 Years | 3-5 Years | Thereafter |
| Long-term debt (1) | $ 1,282.5 | $ 45.5 | $ 95.0 | $ 94.0 | $ 1,048.0 |
| Leases | 71.6 | 6.3 | 19.5 | 17.3 | 28.5 |
| Purchase obligations and other commitments (2) | 247.3 | 121.4 | 106.9 | 19.0 | - |
| Total | $ 1,601.4 | $ 173.2 | $ 221.4 | $ 130.3 | $ 1,076.5 |

The amounts in the table above exclude gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $29.8 million. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
------------------------------

We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
-----------------------------------------------------------

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08 "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers." This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2021-08 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early

application permitted. This ASU is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 25, 2023, and the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements will depend on the contract assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations after that date.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include:

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
------------------------------

Our total net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 13% of our total costs in each of fiscal 2022 and 2021.

We face the risk that our accounts payable and acquisition-related liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 2% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021.

To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost, and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes by approximately $17.4 million and our net income by approximately $24.3 million for fiscal 2022, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency.

Interest Rate Risk on Cash, Cash Equivalents
--------------------------------------------

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. There have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents subsequent to fiscal 2022.

Interest Rate Risk on Debt
--------------------------

With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan, including changes that may result from implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR. See "Note 8. Debt" for further information. A hypothetical increase in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense by approximately $1.6 million.

We currently carry debt that relies on the six-month LIBOR as the benchmark rate. The six-month LIBOR is expected to cease publication after June 30, 2023. To the extent the six-month LIBOR ceases to exist, the Term Loan agreement contemplates an alternative benchmark rate without the need for any amendment thereto.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
--------------------------------

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures
--------------------------------------------------------

Although many of the restrictions and containment measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted or scaled back, some of our employees continue to work from home, or on a hybrid basis. Established business continuity plans were initiated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data, and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 25, 2022, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------------------

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework).

Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 25, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein on page F-2.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
-------------------------------------------------

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Synaptics Incorporated:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synaptics Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 25, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three fiscal year period ended June 25, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions
------------------

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
----------------------

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $169.7 million of inventories as of June 25, 2022 which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions. Additionally, a liability and a charge are recorded to cost of sales for estimated losses on inventory the Company is obligated to purchase from contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule, cancels its order, or for other factors.

We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's estimate of net realizable value for these inventories and losses on inventory purchase obligations. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory and recognition of losses related to outstanding inventory purchase obligations. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company's assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. We also considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a sample of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and losses and compared this to the recorded amounts. We confirmed with the Company's significant vendors regarding outstanding purchase obligations of the Company. Additionally, we tested a sample of returns which resulted from quality related issues of the Company's products during the year and subsequent to period-end to evaluate if additional write-downs or losses were warranted.

Evaluation of certain intangible assets acquired through business combinations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended June 25, 2022, the Company consummated a business combination for total consideration of $543.3 million. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded various intangible assets, which included developed technologies and customer relationships with an acquisition-date fair value of $150.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively.

We identified the evaluation of the fair values allocated to acquired developed technologies and certain customer relationship intangible assets as a critical audit matter. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the significant assumptions used to value these acquired intangible assets, individually and in the aggregate. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were sensitive to possible changes to the following key assumptions, requiring a high degree of auditor judgment and the use of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge:

Developed technologies:
-----------------------

·Projected revenue
------------------

* ·Technology obsolescence

Customer relationship:
----------------------

·Estimated customer ramp up periods
-----------------------------------

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions, as listed above. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's projected revenue, technology obsolescence, and estimated customer ramp up periods by comparing them to historical actual results of the acquired entities and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

·evaluating certain peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of projected revenue by assessing the appropriateness of the guideline comparable companies identified by management's specialist and checking the accuracy of certain peer group and market participant data

·assessing the reasonableness of technology obsolescence based on the nature of the technology acquired.

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
--------------------------------------------------------------

Organization and Basis of Presentation
--------------------------------------

We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions changing the way humans engage with connected devices and data, engineering exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. Our current served markets include Internet of Things, or IoT, personal computer, or PC, and Mobile. We deliver complete chip, firmware and software semiconductor solutions that allow our customers to seamlessly integrate advanced functions into their end products.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and include our financial statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation

Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report were 52-week periods ended June 25, 2022, June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020.

Use of Estimates
----------------

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including our expectations regarding the potential impacts on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash Equivalents and Investments
--------------------------------

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Our cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of bank deposits and money market funds with a fair value of $824.0 million and $836.3 million, respectively.

Short-Term Investments
----------------------

We classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management's intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method, and are reflected as other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent a security's fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security's issuer, likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value. For our debt instruments, we also evaluate whether we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.

Fair Value Measurements
-----------------------

We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
---------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

financial statements approximate the fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature.

Intangible assets, property and equipment, and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our bank debt is variable, which is subject to change from time to time to reflect a market interest rate; accordingly, the carrying value of our bank debt approximates fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk
----------------------------

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy, which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity, limits investments to U.S. government treasuries and agency issues, taxable securities, and municipal issued securities with a minimum rating of investment grade by the rating agencies.

We sell our products to contract manufacturers that provide manufacturing services for OEMs, to some OEMs directly, and to distributors. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer's financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral.

The following customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021:

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer A | 17% | 15% |
| Customer B | 15% | 12% |

Other Concentrations
--------------------

Our products include certain components that are currently single sourced. We believe other vendors would be able to provide similar components, however, the qualification of such vendors may require additional lead time. In order to mitigate any potential adverse impact from a supply disruption, we strive to maintain an adequate supply of critical single-sourced components.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of ASIC chips, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. All of our revenue, except an inconsequential amount, is recognized at a point in time, either on shipment or delivery of the product, depending on customer terms and conditions. Non-product revenue is recognized over the same period of time such performance obligations are satisfied. We then select an appropriate method for measuring satisfaction of the performance obligations.

Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in basis). Master sales agreements are in place with certain customers, and these agreements typically contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a master sales agreement, we consider a customer's purchase order or our standard terms and conditions to be the contract with the customer.

Our pricing terms are negotiated independently, on a stand-alone basis. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration which we expect to receive for the sale of such products. In limited situations, we make sales to certain customers under arrangements where we grant stock rotation rights, price protection and price allowances; variable consideration associated with these rights is expected to be inconsequential. These adjustments and incentives are accounted for as variable consideration, classified as other current liabilities under the revenue standard and are shown as customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for such arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers, and we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts, or price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Stock rotation reserves are based on historical return rates applied to distributor inventory subject to stock rotation rights and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned and recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. In limited circumstances, we enter into volume-based tiered pricing arrangements and we estimate total unit volumes under such arrangement to determine the expected transaction price for the units expected to be transferred. Such arrangements are accounted for as contract liabilities within other accrued liabilities. Sales returns liabilities are recorded as refund liabilities within other accrued liabilities.

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
---------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

Our accounts receivable balance is from contracts with customers and represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from customers. Payments are generally due within three months of completion of the performance obligation and subsequent invoicing and, therefore, do not include significant financing components. In fiscal 2022, there was no material bad debt charge recorded on accounts receivable. There was $1.2 million of contract assets (i.e., unbilled accounts receivable, deferred commissions) recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 25, 2022, and $1.9 million as of June 26, 2021. Contract assets are presented as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities and refund liabilities were $27.3 million and $61.3 million, respectively, as of June 25, 2022, and $7.0 million and $36.1 million, respectively, as of June 26, 2021. Both contract liabilities and refund liabilities are presented as part of customer obligations in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recognized $3.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in revenue related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of each such fiscal year.

We invoice customers for each delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As of June 25, 2022, we did not have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the ASC, we do not disclose revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods. We continue to classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We have elected to continue to account for collection of all taxes on a net basis.

We incur commission expense that is incremental to obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions (which are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations) are expensed when the product is shipped because such commissions are incurred after the product has been shipped.

Revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by geographic area based on customer location and groups of similar products is presented in Note 14 Segment, Customers, and Geographical Information.

Advertising Costs
-----------------

Advertising costs, if any, are expensed when incurred.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
-------------------------------

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer's potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers' creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers' payment trends, and deterioration in customers' operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional bad debt allowances may be required. For the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 credit losses on our accounts receivable were $0.2 million. There were no credit losses on our accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021. We believe that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided.

Cost of Revenue
---------------

Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to our customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers, and the related assembly, package, and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; acquired intangibles amortization; fair value adjustments associated with acquired businesses; inventory write-downs and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs.

Inventories
-----------

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, and consisted of the following (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw materials and work-in-progress | $ 92.2 | $ 49.1 |
| Finished goods | 77.5 | 32.9 |
|  | $ 169.7 | $ 82.0 |

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
---------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

We record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write-up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions.

Property and Equipment
----------------------

We state property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.

Other Assets
------------

During fiscal 2020, we invested $5.0 million in Eta Compute in exchange for preferred stock. This investment provides us with a strategic relationship that enables us to better address expanded industry opportunities for artificial intelligence applications. The investment is accounted for under the cost method.

In April 2017, we paid $18.4 million for a 14.4% interest in OXi Technology Ltd., or OXi. In April 2019, our investment ownership was reduced to 13.8% as a result of new investment in OXi. We determined the equity method of accounting applied to our investment as we had significant influence over OXi's operating and financial policies. We recorded our portion of OXi's net income or net loss on a one quarter lag due to the timing of the availability of OXi's financial records. We did not have any material related party transactions with OXi. During fiscal 2022, we sold our investment in OXi for $5.0 million. In connection with the sale of our investment in OXi, we recorded a gain of $2.5 million, offset by our share of OXi's net losses of $0.9 million. The net gain of $1.6 million is included in Equity investment (gain) loss in the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency
----------------

The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. We remeasure foreign currency expenses at the weighted average exchange rate in the month that the transaction occurred. These foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains and losses, resulted in a net gain of $5.6 million and $0.2 million in fiscal 2022 and 2020, respectively, and a net loss of $1.4 million in fiscal 2021. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill
--------

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization, and Company specific events. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that affect the accuracy of our assumptions, estimates and judgments.

If we determine that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies.

Based on the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of each year presented, the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value; as such, our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary and no goodwill impairment was recognized for each period presented.

Intangible Assets
-----------------

Intangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 1 to 6 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
-------------------------------

We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the last quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Leases
------

We determine if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and reassess that conclusion if the contract is modified. All leases are assessed for classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets are included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are separated into a current portion, included within other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and a non-current portion, included within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not have any finance lease ROU assets or liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not obtain and control the right to use the identified asset until the lease commencement date.

Our lease liabilities are recognized at the applicable lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments required to be paid over the lease term. Because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments to present value. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. We factor in publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Our ROU assets are also recognized at the applicable lease commencement date. The ROU asset equals the carrying amount of the related lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and lease incentives provided by the lessor. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and do not factor into the measurement of the applicable ROU asset or lease liability.

The term of our leases equals the non-cancellable period of the lease, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and also include options to renew or extend the lease (including by not terminating the lease) that we are reasonably certain to exercise. We establish the term of each lease at lease commencement and reassess that term in subsequent periods if a triggering event occurs. Operating lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Our lease contracts often include lease and non-lease components. For our leases, we have elected the practical expedient offered by the standard to not separate lease from non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component.

We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Segment Information
-------------------

We operate in one segment: the development, marketing, and sale of human experience semiconductor solutions for electronic devices and products. The chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is our CEO, Our CODM evaluates financial performance and allocates resources using financial information reported on a company-wide basis.

Share-Based Compensation
------------------------

We charge the estimated fair value less actual forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire underlying award, which is generally three or four years for our restricted stock units, or RSU, awards, three years for our market stock units, or MSU, awards, three years for our performance stock units, or PSU, awards, and up to one year for shares purchased under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan .

We estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period, which is generally three years. The Monte Carlo simulation model that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based MSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based MSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures.

We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. As our phantom stock is a cash-settled award, it is recorded as a liability and remeasured each reporting period.

Income Taxes
------------

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in income on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.

Product Warranty
----------------

We generally provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing for a period of twelve months to meet the stated functionality as agreed to in each sales arrangement. Products are tested against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and do not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. We accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience, and for specific items, at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable.

Business Combinations
---------------------

In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. Each business combination is then accounted for by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations.

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and impacts our preliminary estimates is recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities, will be charged to earnings.

Research and Development
------------------------

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

2. Net Income Per Share
-----------------------

The computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Numerator: |  |  |  |
| Net income | $ 257.5 | $ 79.6 | $ 118.8 |
| Denominator: |  |  |  |
| Shares, basic | 39.0 | 34.8 | 33.6 |
| Effect of dilutive share-based awards and convertible notes | 1.7 | 3.5 | 1.2 |
| Shares, diluted | 40.7 | 38.3 | 34.8 |
| Net income per share: |  |  |  |
| Basic | $ 6.60 | $ 2.29 | $ 3.54 |
| Diluted | $ 6.33 | $ 2.08 | $ 3.41 |

Diluted net income per share does not include the effect of potential common shares related to certain share-based awards for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 as follows (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Share-based awards | 0.1 | - | 0.7 |

These share-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the proceeds received, if any, from such share-based awards combined with the average unamortized compensation costs, were greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive.

Our basic net income per share amounts for each period presented have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Our diluted net income per share amounts for each period presented include the weighted average effect of potentially dilutive shares. We used the "treasury stock" method to determine the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, RSUs, MSUs, PSUs and convertible notes.

3. Property and Equipment
-------------------------

Property and equipment as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions):

|  | Life | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Land |  | $ - | $ 13.3 |
| Building and building improvements | Up to 35 years | - | 52.7 |
| Computer equipment | 3 - 5 years | 19.3 | 22.9 |
| Manufacturing equipment | 1 - 5 years | 93.3 | 71.9 |
| Furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements | 3 - 10 years | 39.6 | 27.2 |
| Capitalized software | 3 - 7 years | 24.3 | 28.1 |
| Construction in progress |  | 9.2 | 6.1 |
|  |  | 185.7 | 222.2 |
| Accumulated depreciation and amortization |  | (122.8 ) | (131.0 ) |
| Property and equipment, net |  | $ 62.9 | $ 91.2 |

Our construction in progress primarily includes machinery and equipment that we expect to place in service in the next 12 months. 4. Acquisitions, Divestiture and Investment

Acquisitions
------------

DSP Group, Inc.
---------------

On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with DSP Group, Inc., or DSPG, to acquire all of the equity of DSPG, a leading global provider of voice and wireless chipset solutions for converged communications, for $22.00 per share in an all-cash transaction, referred to as the DSPG acquisition. The DSPG acquisition closed on

December 2, 2021, or the DSPG Closing Date, whereupon we obtained voice and wireless technology and product solutions for converged communications. In addition, under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, we provided replacement equity awards to the transferred employees and allocated $1.7 million of the replacement equity awards value to consideration transferred.

The DSPG acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 25, 2022, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists.

The adjusted purchase price paid for DSPG was $543.3 million. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):

|  | Final As Adjusted June 25, 2022 |
| --- | --- |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 40.5 |
| Short-term investments | 71.9 |
| Accounts receivable, net | 12.9 |
| Inventory | 22.6 |
| Prepaid expenses and other current assets | 4.0 |
| Property and equipment | 5.9 |
| Intangible assets | 212.0 |
| Right-of-use lease asset | 9.8 |
| Severance pay fund | 16.2 |
| Deferred tax asset | 6.7 |
| Non-current other assets | 2.3 |
| Total identifiable assets acquired | 404.8 |
| Accounts payable | (6.7 ) |
| Other accrued expenses | (19.8 ) |
| Short-term lease liabilities | (1.5 ) |
| Long-term lease liabilities | (8.2 ) |
| Accrued severance | (16.4 ) |
| Deferred tax liability | (39.4 ) |
| Other long-term liabilities | (6.1 ) |
| Total liabilities | (98.1 ) |
| Net identifiable assets acquired | 306.7 |
| Goodwill | 236.6 |
| Net assets acquired | 543.3 |

The following table summarizes the final amounts of the fair values recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these two acquisitions as of the acquisition date as well as adjustments made during the measurement period:

|  | Previously Reported December 25, 2021 | Measurement Period Adjustments (1) | As Adjusted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other current assets | $ 151.9 | - | $ 151.9 |
| Goodwill |  |  |  |
|  | 256.6 | (20.0 ) | 236.6 |
| Developed technology and other intangible assets | 200.5 | 11.5 | 212.0 |
| Deferred tax asset | 0.3 | 6.4 | 6.7 |
| Other long-term assets | 35.6 | (1.4 ) | 34.2 |

(1) The measurement period adjustments were based upon information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized at that date.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the intangible assets as of the DSPG Closing Date (in millions):

|  | Estimated Weighted Average Useful Lives in Years |  | Estimated Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developed technology | 5.2 | $ | 150 |
| Customer contracts and related relationships | 4.0 |  | 45 |
| In process research and development | N/A |  | 16 |
| Trade names |  | 1.0 | 1 |
| Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles |  | $ | 212 |

We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 4% to 18%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.

In-process research and development consists of advanced semiconductor telecommunications products for the Internet of Things, or IoT, market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in calendar year 2023.

The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DSPG as of the DSPG Closing Date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Prior to the DSPG acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DSPG.

The consolidated financial statements include approximately $83.8 million of revenue from the DSPG Closing Date through June 25, 2022. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DSPG as we initiated the integration of a substantial portion of DSPG into our ongoing operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which was completed in the subsequent quarter.

Supplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)
----------------------------------------------

The supplemental pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisition had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.

The following supplemental pro forma information presents the combined results of operations for the year ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, as if DSPG had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, adjustments to record acquired inventories at fair value, transaction and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal 2022 was an increase to net income of $5.9 million and a decrease in net income of $86.3 million in fiscal 2021. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the periods presented is as follows (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | 1,802.6 | 1,466.0 |

DisplayLink
-----------

On July 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of equity interest in DisplayLink Corporation, or DisplayLink, a leader in highperformance video compression technology, for $305 million in cash adjusted for (i) estimated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the closing (ii) estimated indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the closing, (iii) unpaid portion as of the closing of certain transaction expenses incurred by DisplayLink, and (iv) the amount that the estimated working capital of DisplayLink exceeds or falls short, respectively, of a certain specified target working capital set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with $3.1 million of the purchase price held in escrow accounts for adjustments after closing and to secure the Seller Parties' indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement. The acquisition closed on July 31, 2020, or the DisplayLink Closing Date, whereupon we obtained high-performance video compression technology which will further enhance our current IoT business.

This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill. Our estimate of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets at June 26, 2021, was based on established and accepted valuation techniques performed with the assistance of our third-party valuation specialists.

The adjusted purchase price paid for DisplayLink was $444.0 million.

The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the DisplayLink Closing Date (in millions):

| Cash and cash equivalents | 40.9 |
| --- | --- |
| Short-term investments | 94.0 |
| Accounts receivable, net | 7.1 |
| Inventory | 33.1 |

| Total liabilities | (67.0 ) |
| Net identifiable assets acquired | 337.6 |
| Goodwill | 106.4 |
| Net assets acquired | 444.0 |

There were no measurement period adjustments during fiscal year ended June 25, 2022. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2021 we recorded measurement period adjustments of $0.9 million to goodwill comprising of increases of $2.3 million in prepaid expenses and decreases of $0.8 million to other accrued liabilities and increases of $1.4 million in other long-term liabilities for a net increase of $1.7 million to the fair value of other acquired net tangible assets.

We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which range from 11.0% to 11.5%. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.

In-process research and development consists of a next generation docking and video interface products for the IoT market. We expect to complete the in-process research and development project in fiscal 2023.

The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of DisplayLink as of the DisplayLink Closing Date. No ne of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Prior to the DisplayLink acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with DisplayLink.

The consolidated financial statements include approximately $115.3 million and $110.0 million of revenue during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to DisplayLink as we integrated a substantial portion of DisplayLink into our ongoing operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 .

The following unaudited pro forma financial information (in millions, except per share data) presents the combined results of operations for us and DisplayLink as if the DisplayLink acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2020. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the actual operating results that would have been recorded had the DisplayLink acquisition actually taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and should not be taken as indicative of future consolidated operating results.

Pro forma adjustments used to arrive at pro forma net income included adjustments for historical amortization expense, the addition of intangible amortization expense for the value of intangibles under the purchase price allocation, transaction costs and restructuring costs. The total pro forma adjustments for fiscal 2021 was a decrease to net income of $1.1 million.

Broadcom Wireless Connectivity Business
---------------------------------------

On July 2, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom's existing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS/GNSS products and business in the IoT market, or Broadcom Business Acquisition, for an aggregate consideration of $250 million in cash which closed on July 23, 2020, or the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. We also entered into certain transition

agreements with Broadcom for a period of three years. We acquired these assets and assumed certain liabilities from Broadcom in order to obtain wireless connectivity technology which will enhance our current IoT business.

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities has been recorded as goodwill.

We entered into a derivative and roadmap product agreement and an asset purchase agreement with Broadcom. The derivative and roadmap product agreement includes the purchase of derivative and roadmap product development services to be performed by Broadcom. We estimated the value of the development services to be approximately $25.0 million, and accounted for it separate from the business combination. At June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021, the net book value of the development services is $5.8 million and $15.8 million, respectively. The estimated value of the development services is amortizing over the period of time estimated to complete the development or approximately thirty months. The amortization of the estimated cost of development is included in research and development in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, under the terms of the asset purchase agreement we provided replacement equity compensation awards to the transferred employees and Broadcom agreed to make cash payments to transferred employees as incentive to accept employment offers from our company. We determined $3.5 million of value related to these arrangements should be included as consideration transferred, which was partially offset by $2.0 million of cash payments to transferred employees as a reduction of consideration transferred.

The following table summarizes the amounts recorded for the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date (in millions):

| Property and equipment | $ 1.0 |
| --- | --- |
| Acquired intangible assets | 123.0 |
| Total identifiable assets acquired | 124.0 |
| Liabilities assumed | (0.2 ) |
| Goodwill | 102.8 |
| Net assets acquired | $ 226.6 |

We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model for each of the underlying identified intangible assets. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each intangible asset over its remaining useful life, and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which is 2.2% for order backlog and 13.0% for the rest of the intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the technology migration curve, customer ramp up period and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each intangible asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.

| Customer contracts and related relationships | 6.0 | 18 |
| Order backlog | 0.5 | 12 |
| Estimated fair value of acquired intangibles |  | 123 |

The value of goodwill reflects the anticipated synergies of the combined operations and workforce of the transferred Broadcom Business assets as of the Broadcom Business Acquisition Closing Date. A ll of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Prior to the Broadcom Business Acquisition, we did not have an existing relationship or transactions with Broadcom.

The consolidated financial statements include approximately $228.8 million and $100.4 million of revenue during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Broadcom Business Acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the Broadcom Business Acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close.

Divestiture
-----------

In December 2020, we completed the sale of limited audio technology intangible assets, received a fully-paid up perpetual license back from the buyer and, as an element of the transaction licensed other audio technology intangible assets to the buyer under a fully-paid up perpetual license arrangement. Under the asset purchase agreement and the intellectual property license agreement, we received $35.0 million in cash. The gain on the sale of the audio technology assets was $34.2 million.

In April 2020, we completed the sale of the assets of our LCD Touch Controller and Display Driver Integration product line, or TDDI, for LCD mobile displays. We retained our automotive TDDI product line and our discrete touch and discrete display driver product lines supporting LCD and OLED for the mobile market. The assets sold under the asset purchase agreement had a carrying value of approximately $33.6 million as of the closing date of the transaction for cash consideration of $138.7 million. The gain on sale of the assets was $105.1 million.

| Total short-term investments | $ | 54.0 | $ (2.0 ) | $ 52.0 |

We did not hold any short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2021. We use the specific-identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our short-term investments classified as available-for-sale. During fiscal 2022, we did not realize significant gains or losses on a gross level from the sale of our short-term investments classified as available-for-sale.

All available-for-sale securities have been classified as current, based on management's intent and ability to use the funds in current operations.

6. Fair Value Measurements
--------------------------

We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value :

* ·Level 1 - Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
* ·Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.

·Level 3 - Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements.

The fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets and are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models.

At June 25, 2022, financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

|  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assets: |  |  |  |  |
| Cash equivalents: |  |  |  |  |
| Money market funds | $ 12.1 | $ - | $ - | $ 12.1 |

| Municipal bonds | - | 7.8 | - | 7.8 |
|  | $ 12.1 | $ 52.0 | $ - | $ 64.1 |

We did not hold any financial assets measured at fair value during fiscal 2021.

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We report our financial instruments at fair value with the exception of the Senior Debt and Term Loan ("Note 8. Debt"). The estimated fair value of the notes was determined based on the trading price of the notes as of the last day of trading for the period. We consider the fair value of the notes to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded in markets.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Senior Notes and Term Debt are as follows for the periods presented (in millions):

During fiscal 2021, we retired fully amortized intangible assets of $143.6 million of display driver developed technology and $28.3 million of customer relationships.

Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The total amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets was $123.5 million in fiscal 2022, $110.1 million in fiscal 2021, and $51.4 million in fiscal 2020. This amortization expense was included in our consolidated statements of operations as acquired intangibles amortization and cost of revenue.

8. Debt
-------

Senior Debt
-----------

On March 11, 2021, we completed an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due 2029, or the Senior Notes, in a private offering. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 11, 2021, or the Senior Notes Indenture, by and among our company, the guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture provides that the Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.0% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on December 15 and June 15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2029 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities.

Prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date.

We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes on or after June 15, 2024 at the redemption prices specified below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date:

| Year | Price |
| --- | --- |
| 2024 | 102 % |
| 2025 | 101 |
| 2026 and thereafter | 100 % |

In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by us.

The Senior Notes are the general unsecured obligations of our company. The Senior Note guarantees are the senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor. Under certain circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their Senior Note guarantees without consent of the holders of Senior Notes. Under the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness, and rank contractually senior in right of payment to our and the guarantors' future indebtedness and other obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our and the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Senior Notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company's or any parent's capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default including, without limitation, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, cross-acceleration to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and failure to pay certain judgments. An event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases, will automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding Notes.

Debt issuance costs relating to the Senior Notes of $5.7 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over 99 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 25, 2022 was $16.6 million.

Revolving Credit Facility
-------------------------

On March 11, 2021, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with the lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, or the Credit Agreement, to, among other changes, extend the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, to five years from the closing date of the amendment, increase the facility size from $200.0 million to $250.0 million, and replace the requirement to maintain a total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 with a requirement to maintain a net total debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.00, provided further, that such deemed increase pursuant to the foregoing shall not apply to more than two material acquisitions consummated during the term of the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $250 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $25 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Future proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In March 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes described above to repay the $100.0 million outstanding borrowings on this revolving credit facility. As of June 25, 2022, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in full by March 11, 2026. Debt issuance costs relating to the revolving credit facility of $1.6 million, included in non-current other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, are being amortized over 60 months.

Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties' direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.

The revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Credit Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. The LIBOR index is expected to be discontinued at the end of June 2023. Under our credit facility, when the LIBOR index is discontinued, we will switch to a comparable or successor rate as selected by us and the administrative agent, which may include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR.

Under the Credit Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including two financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction that permits accounts receivable financings provided that the aggregate unpaid amount of permitted accounts receivable financings are no more than the greater of $100 million and 50% of the amount of all accounts receivable of our company and specified subsidiaries and other specific items. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to Consolidated EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 4.25 to 1.00, and thereafter 3.75 to 1.0. The interest coverage ratio is Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Credit Agreement. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants.

Term Loan Facility
------------------

On December 2, 2021, we entered into that certain First Amendment and Lender Joinder Agreement to the Credit Agreement, to, among other things, establish a new $600.0 million incremental term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility was advanced by certain existing and new lenders under the Credit Agreement to finance the DSPG

------------------------------------------------------

acquisition. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 2, 2028. Principal on the Term Loan Facility is payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, beginning December 31, 2021, at a rate of 1.00% per annum.

Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.25% or at the base rate plus 1.50%, subject to a 25 basis point step-down based on total gross leverage, and subject to a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, in each case consistent with the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenant.

The Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in the event all or any portion of the Term Loan Facility is prepaid within the first 6 months in connection with a repricing transaction only. The Term Loan Facility is subject to customary mandatory prepayments, including, commencing June 30, 2023, an excess cash flow sweep, subject to customary step-downs and thresholds.

Debt issuance costs relating to the Term Loan Facility of $11.2 million, netted against the debt amount on the consolidated balance sheet, are amortized as interest expense over 96 months. The total interest expense recorded on the Term Loan during fiscal 2022 was $10.4 million.

Convertible Debt
----------------

On June 1, 2021, pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2017 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Convertible Notes Indenture, we provided an irrevocable notice of redemption, for all $525,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.50% convertible senior notes due in 2022, or the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were redeemable at a cash redemption price of 100.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date of August 4, 2021.

Holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to convert the Convertible Notes called for redemption no later than August 3, 2021, or the Conversion Deadline. The conversion rate was equal to 13.7267 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which was the initial conversion rate of 13.6947 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus a number of additional shares equal to 0.0320 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We elected to settle any conversions by Combination Settlement (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) with a Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes equal to $1,000, plus a number of shares of the our common stock, to be determined pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, together with additional cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional shares of common stock. As a result of this election, on August 4, 2021, we settled or redeemed the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes for $505.6 million in cash representing the principal amount outstanding and delivered approximately 3.5 million shares in common stock from our treasury stock for additional amounts, resulting in a loss of approximately $8.1 million which is included in Interest and other expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies

9. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies
----------------------------------------

Leases
------

In fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, or ASC 842, Leases, which requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases on our consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the effective date as permitted. As a result, we were not required to adjust our comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for the periods before the date of adoption. We elected the package of practical expedients which allows us not to reassess (1) whether existing or expired contracts, as of the adoption date, contain leases, (2) the lease classification for existing leases, and (3) whether existing initial direct costs meet the new definition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases, and to not recognize ROU assets and liabilities for short-term leases.

The most significant impact of the adoption of the standard was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows.

Our leases primarily include our headquarters office and worldwide office and research and development facilities which are all classified as operating leases. Certain leases include renewal options that are under our discretion. The leases expire at various dates through fiscal year 2034, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to seven years. During fiscal

2022, we recorded approximately $12.7 million of operating leases expense. Our short-term leases are immaterial and we do not have finance leases.

As of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, the components of leases are as follows (in millions):

We recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis of $12.7 million, and $10.1 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Sale and Leaseback Transaction

On February 8, 2022, we executed a sale and leaseback transaction of our properties located at 1109-1251 McKay Drive and 1140-1150 Ringwood Court, San Jose, California, for a purchase price, net of closing and other expenses payable by us, of $55.9 million. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a lease agreement with the buyer to lease back the land and properties located at 1109 and 1151 McKay Drive, San Jose, California, for an initial term of 12 years and a renewal option for an additional seven years. The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification, and we recorded a gain of $5.4 million which is recorded in the gain on sale and leaseback transaction line in the consolidated statements of operations.

Legal proceedings
-----------------

We are subject to a variety of claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statements of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.

Contingencies
-------------

We have in the past and may in the future receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.

Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Indemnifications
----------------

In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third-party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights by us. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant. We have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such indemnification obligations.

10. Stockholders' Equity
------------------------

Preferred Stock
---------------

We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to establish, from time to time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences, and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock and the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2022, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Shares Reserved for Future Issuance
-----------------------------------

Shares of common stock reserved for future issuance as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows:

| Stock options outstanding | 31,185 |
| --- | --- |
| Restricted stock units outstanding | 1,220,573 |
| Market stock units outstanding | 251,974 |
| Performance stock units outstanding | 441,375 |
| Awards available for grant under all share-based compensation plans | 4,449,604 |
| Reserved for future issuance | 6,394,711 |

Treasury Stock
--------------

Our cumulative authorization of repurchases under our common stock repurchase program as of the end of fiscal 2022 was $1.8 billion expiring July 2025. The program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock repurchased under this program is held as treasury stock. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had $577.4 million of common stock remaining to be repurchased under our common stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we issued 3.5 million and 0.1 million shares, respectively, from treasury stock for settlement of redemptions of our convertible notes. Share-Based Compensation

11. Share-Based Compensation
----------------------------

The purpose of our various share-based compensation plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward high-quality employees, directors, and consultants by enabling such persons to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in our common stock in order to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such persons and our stockholders and to provide such persons with annual and long-term performance incentives to focus their best efforts on the creation of stockholder value. Consequently, we determine whether to grant share-based compensatory awards subsequent to the initial award for our employees and consultants primarily on individual performance.

Share-Based Compensation Plans
------------------------------

On October 29, 2019, our stockholders approved: (i) our 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2019 Incentive Plan, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, and (ii) our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2019 ESPP, to replace our Amended and Restated 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our 2010 ESPP. Upon approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan, new awards are no longer issued under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding at October 29, 2019 under our prior share-based compensation plans were not impacted by the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan and continue to remain outstanding and vest by their terms under the applicable share-based compensation plan. Shares underlying certain share-based awards forfeited under the 2010 Incentive Plan subsequent to the approval of the 2019 Incentive Plan automatically transfer to and become available for award issuance from the 2019 Incentive Plan.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, cash incentive awards, performance shares, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. The cumulative number of shares approved under the 2019 Incentive Plan was 4,590,000. The 2019 ESPP authorizes us to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in our company through the purchase of stock at a discount, with an initial authorization of 1,500,000 shares.

Effective August 19, 2019, we adopted the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan. 650,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, or other changes in our common stock or capital structure. The 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is intended to comply with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which provide an exception to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules' on the shareholder approval requirement for the issuance of securities with regards to grants to employees of the company or its subsidiaries as an inducement material to such individuals entering into employment with the company or its subsidiaries. An individual was eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan only if he or she was not previously an employee or director of our company (or is returning to work after a bona-fide period of non-employment), and an award under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan is a material inducement for him or her to accept employment with our company. As a result of approval by our stockholders of our amended and restated 2019 Incentive Plan on October 27, 2020, no new awards will be granted under the 2019 Inducement Equity Plan.

Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding awards consist of our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, and our 2019 ESPP.

Share-based compensation awards available for grant or issuance for each plan as of the beginning of the fiscal year, including changes in the balance of awards available for grant for fiscal 2022, were as follows:

|  | Awards Available Under All Share-Based Award Plans | 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan | 2019 Employee Inducement Equity Plan | 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan | 2010 Incentive Compensation Plan | DSPG Replacement Award Plan |

Included in the preceding table is share-based compensation for our cash-settled phantom stock units, which we granted in October 2019 (see Phantom Stock Units below) (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost of revenue | $ 0.2 | 0.4 | $ 0.2 |
| Research and development | 27.2 | 21.9 | 9.1 |
| Selling, general, and administrative | 4.7 | 4.7 | 1.8 |
| Total | $ 32.1 | 27 | $ 11.1 |

We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans, including RSUs, market stock units, or MSUs, PSUs, and phantom stock units. We do not recognize a tax benefit upon expensing all or a portion of share-based awards granted to certain executive officers and certain foreign-based employees.

We compare the actual tax benefit associated with the tax deduction from share-based award activity to the hypothetical tax benefit based on the grant date fair values of the corresponding share-based awards. Tax benefit associated with excess tax deduction creditable to income tax provision is recognized when incurred. Tax deficiency associated with a tax shortfall is debited to income tax provision when incurred.

Historically, we have issued new shares in connection with our share-based compensation plans, however, treasury shares are also available for issuance. Any additional shares repurchased under our common stock repurchase program will be available for issuance under our share-based compensation plans.

Stock Options
-------------

Our share-based compensation plans with outstanding stock option awards include our 2010 Incentive Plan. Under our 2010 Incentive Plan, we were able to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock at not less than 100% of the fair market value, or FMV, on the date of grant. We ceased granting stock options in fiscal 2018.

Options granted under our 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest three to four years from the vesting commencement date and expire seven years after the date of grant if not exercised.

Certain stock option activity for fiscal 2022 and balances as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows:

|  | Stock Option Awards Outstanding | Weighted Average Exercise Price | Intrinsic Value (In millions) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at June 2021 | 55,061 | $ 66.68 |  |
| Exercised | (23,876 ) | 73.44 |  |
| Balance at June 2022 | 31,185 | 61.50 | $ 2.1 |
| Exercisable at June 2022 | 31,185 | 61.50 | $ 2.1 |

The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022, of $128.78. All of the stock options outstanding were vested and in-the-money as of the end of fiscal 2022.

Cash received and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cash received | 5.3 | 23.9 | $ 23.9 |
| Aggregate intrinsic value | 3.6 | 8.6 | $ 10.8 |

There have been no stock options granted since fiscal 2018.

There was no unrecognized share-based compensation costs for stock options granted under our various plans.

Restricted Stock Units
----------------------

Our 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of RSUs to our employees, consultants, and directors, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provided for the grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An RSU and a DSU are each a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement and the words can be used interchangeably. We began granting DSUs in January 2006 and RSUs in 2019. The use of RSUs will cover the meaning of both RSUs and DSUs.

RSUs granted generally vest ratably over three to four years from the vesting commencement date. Delivery of shares under the plans take place on the quarterly vesting dates. At the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover applicable statutory minimum tax withholding for grantees subject to withholding and deliver a net quantity of shares to the grantee after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the RSU award.

RSU activity, including RSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows:

|  | RSU Awards Outstanding | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at June 2021 | 1,323,286 |  | $ 64.13 |
| Granted | 641,690 |  | 183.97 |
| Delivered | (578,400 ) |  | 63.23 |
| Forfeited | (166,003 ) |  | 120.72 |
| Balance at June 2022 | 1,220,573 | $ 157.2 | 119.83 |

Of the shares delivered, 169,529 shares valued at $31.4 million were withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022, of $128.78.

The unrecognized share-based compensation cost for RSUs granted under our 2019 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan was approximately $107.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. The aggregate market value of RSUs delivered in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $106.4 million, $48.2 million, and $36.0 million, respectively.

Market Stock Units
------------------

Our 2019 Incentive Plan, and previously our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, provide for the grant of MSU awards, to our employees, consultants, and directors. An MSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of market-based performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the MSU grant agreement.

We have granted MSU awards to our executive officers and other management members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which are designed to vest in three or four tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third or one-fourth of the total MSU grant. The first tranche vests based on a one-year performance period; the second tranche vests based on a two-year performance period; the third tranche vests based on a three-year performance period; and the fourth tranche (in the case of four-year vesting) vests based on a four-year performance period.

For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of total stockholder return, or TSR, relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the target grant quantity based on our TSR performance relative to the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. No payout will occur if our TSR performance falls below the 25$^{th}$ percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index, and a 200% payout will occur if our TSR performance exceeds the 75$^{th}$ percentile of the TSRs of each company in the Russell 2000 Index. Performance payouts between the 25$^{th}$ and 75$^{th}$ percentiles will be determined on a linear basis with performance at the 50$^{th}$ percentile equal to 100% of target.

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
---------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

For MSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, the first tranche and the second tranche can payout up to 200%, and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the three-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche.

For outstanding MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021, performance is measured based on our achievement of a specified level of TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, or SPSISC Index. The potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a two-toone ratio based on our TSR performance relative to SPSISC Index TSR.

For MSU awards granted prior to fiscal 2021 and vesting over three years, the payout for the first tranche and the second tranche will not exceed 100% and the payout for the third tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the threeyear performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche and the second tranche. For MSUs vesting over four years, the payout for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche will not exceed 100% and the payout for the fourth tranche will be calculated based on the total target quantity for the entire grant multiplied by the payout factor, based on performance for the four-year performance period, less shares issued for the first tranche, the second tranche and the third tranche.

Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable MSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable performance period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the MSU award.

MSU activity, including MSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of MSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows:

|  | MSU Awards Outstanding | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at June 2021 | 347,027 |  | $ 82.18 |
| Granted | 65,000 |  | 191.68 |
| Performance adjustment | 69,728 |  | - |
| Delivered | (203,883 ) |  | 78.05 |
| Forfeited | (25,898 ) |  | 136.26 |
| Balance at June 2022 | 251,974 | $ 32.4 |  |

As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 185.21 percentage points for the tranche three payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 200% of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2019 MSU grants. As a result of the Synaptics TSR outperforming the Index TSR by 226.12 percentage points for the tranche two payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 100% of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2020 MSU grants as the tranche two payout is capped at a 100% payout. As a result of the Synaptics TSR performing at the 76$^{th}$ percentile relative to the constituents of the Russell 2000 Index for the tranche one payout period ended in fiscal 2022, we delivered 200% of the targeted shares underlying the fiscal 2021 MSU grants.

Of the shares delivered, 105,719 shares valued at $18.3 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The aggregate intrinsic value assumes a 100% payout factor and was determined using the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022, or June 24, 2022, of $128.78.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
------------------------------------------------------

The fair value of each MSU granted from our plans for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was estimated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model, assuming no expected dividends and the following assumptions:

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected volatility of company | 52.61 % | 53.62 % | 45.46% - 52.55% |
| Expected volatility of Index | 17.4% - 581.6% | 19.6% - 197.6% | 24.64% - 33.44% |
| Correlation coefficient | 0.53 | 0.51 | 0.53 - 0.58 |
| Expected life in years | 2.87 | 2.87 | 2.50 - 4.00 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 0.40 % | 0.17 % | 0.26% - 1.52% |
| Fair value per award | $284.43 - $342.89 | $131.34 - $175.15 | $55.52 - $100.38 |

We amortize the compensation expense over the three- or four-year performance and service period on a ratable basis. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our outstanding MSUs was approximately $14.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.72 years.

Performance Stock Units
-----------------------

Our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2010 Incentive Plan provide for the grant of PSU awards to our employees, consultants, and directors. A PSU is a promise to deliver shares of our common stock at a future date based on the achievement of performance-based requirements in accordance with the terms of the PSU grant agreement.

We have granted PSU awards to our executive officers and other key management team members under our 2010 Incentive Plan, our 2019 Incentive Plan and our 2019 Inducement Equity Plan, which, generally, are designed to vest in three tranches with the target quantity for each tranche equal to one-third of the total PSU award. Generally, PSU awards have a specific one-year performance period and vesting occurs over three service periods with the final service period ending approximately three years from the grant date. Performance is measured based on the achievement of a specified level of performance relative to predefined performance criteria (for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2022 and prior to fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on non-GAAP earnings per share, for PSU awards granted in fiscal 2021 the performance criteria is based on a combination of our design win revenue, non-GAAP gross margin percentage and non-GAAP operating expenses). For our fiscal 2022 PSU awards, the potential payout ranges from 0% to 200% of the target grant quantity and is adjusted on a linear basis with a payout triggering if our measurement results equals greater than 75% of the target with a maximum payout achieved at 125% of target.

Delivery of shares earned, if any, will take place on the dates provided in the applicable PSU grant agreement, assuming the grantee is still an employee, consultant, or director of our company at the end of the applicable service period. On the delivery date, we withhold shares to cover statutory tax withholding requirements and deliver a net quantity of shares to the recipient after such withholding. Until delivery of shares, the grantee has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares underlying the PSU award.

PSU activity, including PSUs granted, delivered, and forfeited in fiscal 2022, and the balance and aggregate intrinsic value of PSUs as of the end of fiscal 2022 were as follows:

|  | PSU Awards Outstanding | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at June 2021 | 317,392 |  | $ 62.41 |
| Granted | 96,914 |  | 111.90 |
| Performance adjustment | 88,762 |  | - |
| Delivered | (208,023 ) |  | 55.01 |
| Forfeited | (37,142 ) |  | 79.79 |
| Balance at June 2022 | 257,903 | $ 33.2 |  |

We value PSUs using the aggregate intrinsic value on the grant date and amortize the compensation expense over the three-year service period on a ratable basis, dependent upon the probability of meeting the performance measures. Of the shares delivered, 94,642 shares valued at $17.6 million were withheld to meet statutory minimum tax withholding requirements. The PSU awards outstanding balance at June 2022 is based on the target grant quantity and does not include the performance adjustment of 183,472 shares for completed performance periods. The unrecognized share-based compensation cost of our

------------------------------------------------------

outstanding PSUs was approximately $31.7 million as of June 25, 2022, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.72 years.

Phantom Stock Units
-------------------

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to non-employee directors, officers and employees. We initially granted phantom stock units in October 2019. Phantom stock units are cash-settled and entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a single share for each unit based on the average closing share price of our stock over the thirty calendar days prior to the vesting date. Grants of phantom stock units vest over three years, with an annual vesting date of October 31 each year subsequent to the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for phantom stock units on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the average closing price of our common stock over the thirty calendar days ended prior to each balance sheet date. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $135.07 per unit at June 25, 2022 and our accrued liability for such units was $15.4 million. The outstanding phantom stock units had a fair value of $140.17 per unit at June 26, 2021 and our accrued liability for such units was $18.4 million.

Phantom stock activity was as follows:

|  | Phantom Stock Units Outstanding | Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Balance as of June 2021 | 402,458 |  |
| Paid | (196,420 ) |  |

Our 2019 ESPP became effective October 29, 2019 and replaced our 2010 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP, and previously the 2010 ESPP, allows employees to designate up to 15% of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lesser of the FMV at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to one year and includes two exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the 2010 ESPP, the offering period extended for up to two years and included four exercise dates occurring at six-month intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, and previously under our 2010 ESPP, if the FMV at an exercise date is less than the FMV at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence.

Shares purchased, weighted average purchase price, cash received, and the aggregate intrinsic value for employee stock purchase plan purchases in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions, except shares purchased and weighted average purchase price):

| Shares purchased | 2022 138,502 | 2021 220,389 | 2020 346,502 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weighted average purchase price | $ 97.90 | $ 57.00 | $ 30.50 |
|  | $ | $ 12.6 | $ 10.6 |
| Cash received Aggregate intrinsic value | 13.6 $ 12.5 | $ 10.3 | $ 10.1 |

The fair value of each award granted under our 2019 ESPP and our 2010 ESPP for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per award for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $38.93, $20.82 and $15.48, respectively.

Unrecognized share-based compensation costs for awards granted under our 2019 ESPP at the end of fiscal 2022 were approximately $1.4 million that will be amortized over the next 2 months.

12. Employee Benefit Plans
--------------------------

401(k) Plan
-----------

We have a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for full-time employees in the U.S. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their net compensation up to the annual limit of $20,500, or $27,000 for employees who are 50 years or older. In fiscal 2022, we provided matching funds of 25% of our employees' contributions, excluding catch-up contributions.

Non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in "Non-current other assets" and "Other long-term liabilities", respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deferred tax assets: |  |  |
| Capital loss carryforward | 17.8 | $ 0.2 |
| Inventory write downs | 2.6 | 3.9 |
| Property and equipment and intangible assets | 11.7 | 6.0 |
| Share-based compensation | 12.0 | 8.8 |
| Nondeductible interest | 5.4 | - |
| Business credit carryforward | 62.0 | 39.1 |
| Lease liabilities | 11.2 | 6.5 |
| Net operating loss carryforward | 16.3 | 7.2 |
| Other accruals | 5.6 | 5.1 |
|  | 144.6 | 76.8 |
| Valuation allowance | (59.0 ) | (32.6 ) |
|  | 85.6 | 44.2 |
| Deferred tax liabilities: |  |  |
| Property and equipment | (2.0 ) | (0.9 ) |
| Interest | - | (3.4 ) |
| Right-of-use assets | (11.5 ) | (6.2 ) |
| Unremitted foreign earnings | (22.1 ) | (3.5 ) |
| Acquisition intangibles | (45.8 ) | (29.0 ) |
|  | (81.4 ) | (43.0 ) |
| Net deferred tax assets | 4.2 | $ 1.2 |

Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2022, a valuation allowance of $59.0 million was maintained to reduce deferred tax assets primarily related to state tax credits and capital losses carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2022 was an increase of $26.4 million, primarily due to an increase of unrealized deferred tax assets associated with the capital loss carryforwards from our DSPG acquisition..

We consider most of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. Further, we determined not to indefinitely reinvest earnings of certain subsidiaries acquired as part of our DSPG acquisition and established a $17.9 million deferred tax liability on the acquisition date balance sheet. As a result, $22.1 million of our deferred tax liability is associated with unremitted foreign earnings, which if remitted would not result in a further provision for income taxes. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $200 million on certain accumulated earnings and outside basis differences primarily related to our DSPG acquisition. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, the associated foreign tax credits would be expected to reduce the U.S. income tax liability associated with the foreign distribution or the otherwise taxable transaction. As of our fiscal 2022, assuming full utilization of the associated foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and outside basis differences would be approximately $46 million.

As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had federal, California, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.7 million, $14.8 million, and $58.2 million, respectively. The federal and California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2034 and 2029, respectively, if not utilized. Most of our foreign net operating losses have no expiration date. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income or income taxes may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership.

We had $25.4 million and $50.4 million of federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, respectively, as of the end of fiscal 2022. The federal research tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2029 and the state research tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely.

The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, increased by $7.2 million from $22.6 million in fiscal 2021 to $29.8 million in fiscal 2022. Of this amount, $19.6 million will reduce the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 consisted of the following (in millions):

|  | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Beginning balance | $ 22.6 | $ 20.1 | $ 18.9 |
| Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions | 7.1 | 5.5 | 3.2 |
| Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions |  | 5.5 - | 0.1 |
| Remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits |  | (0.5 ) - | - |
| Decrease due to statute expiration |  | (4.9 ) (3.0 ) | (2.1 ) |
| Ending Balance | $ 29.8 | $ 22.6 | $ 20.1 |

Accrued interest and penalties increased by $0.8 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 and decreased by $0.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. Accrued interest and penalties were $2.5 million and $1.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $0.9 million to an increase of $6.9 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.

Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Israel and the U.K. From fiscal 2016 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions.

In January 2022, final foreign tax credit regulations, final regulations, were issued by the U.S. Treasury modifying long established rules, including rules used in the determination of whether foreign taxes paid or accrued are creditable against U.S. income taxes. Subsequently, in July 2022, technical corrections and amendments to the final regulations were issued by the U.S. Treasury. These technical corrections and amendments do not change our initial view that certain foreign taxes we incur may not be creditable under the final regulations. We are currently assessing the impact of the final regulations, together with certain research and development capitalization rules, all effective beginning with our fiscal 2023, but anticipate the impact will have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2023 and future provision for income taxes.

14. Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information
