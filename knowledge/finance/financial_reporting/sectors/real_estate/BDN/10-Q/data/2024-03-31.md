<h2>EXPLANATORY NOTE</h2>
<p>This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 of Brandywine Realty Trust (the "Parent Company") and Brandywine Operating Partnership L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"). The Parent Company is a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the "Company". In addition, as used in this report, terms such as "we", "us", and "our" may refer to the Company, the Parent Company, or the Operating Partnership.</p>
<p>The Parent Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of March 31, 2024, owned a 99.7% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.3% interest consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day operations and management.</p>
<p>Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership.</p>
<p>As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company's operations on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.</p>
<p>The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into a single report will:</p>
<ul>
<li>· facilitate a better understanding by the investors of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;</li>
<li>· remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership; and</li>
<li>· create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the footnote disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time (and contributing the net proceeds of such issuances to the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing the debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in the real estate ventures described below. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company's business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company's business through the Operating Partnership's operations, by the Operating Partnership's incurrence of indebtedness (directly and through subsidiaries) and through the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership or equity interests in subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.</p>
<p>The equity and non-controlling interests in the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership's equity are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements while the common units of limited partnership interests held by parties other than the Parent Company are presented as non-controlling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements. The differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership's equity relate to the differences in the equity issued at the Parent Company and Operating Partnership levels.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>To help investors understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following as separate notes or sections for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Consolidated Financial Statements; and</li>
<li>· Notes to the Parent Company's and Operating Partnership's Equity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This report also includes separate Item 4. (Controls and Procedures) disclosures and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Parent Company and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and 18 U.S.C. § 1350.</p>
<p>In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosures of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to such disclosures as those of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and real estate ventures and holds assets and incurs debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and the Parent Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership.</p>

<h2>NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<ol>
<li>ORGANIZATION OF THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Brandywine Realty Trust (the "Parent Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") engaged in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, ownership, management, and operation of a portfolio of office and mixed-use properties. The Parent Company owns its assets and conducts its operations through Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.

| Office properties | 65 | 11,773,665 |
| Mixed-use properties | 4 | 924,450 |

| Development property | 2 | 144,685 |
| Recently completed - not stabilized property | 1 | 168,294 |
| The Properties | 72 | 13,011,094 |</p>
<p>In addition to the Properties, as of March 31, 2024, the Company owned 141.6 acres of land held for development. The Company also held a leasehold interest inone land parcel totaling 0.8 acres, acquired through a prepaid 99-year ground lease, and held options to purchase approximately5.1 additional acres of undeveloped land. As of March 31, 2024, the total potential development that this inventory of land could support under current zoning and entitlements, including the parcels under option, amounted to an estimated 12.1 million net rentable square feet.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company also owned economic interests intwelve unconsolidated real estate ventures (see Note 4, "Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures," for further information). The Properties and the properties owned by the unconsolidated real estate ventures are primarily located in or near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; Metropolitan Washington, D.C.; Southern New Jersey; and Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
<p>The Company conducts its third-party real estate management services business primarily through wholly-owned management company subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2024, the management company subsidiaries were managing properties containing an aggregate of approximately 22.3 million net rentable square feet, of which approximately 13.0 million net rentable square feet related to Properties owned by the Company and approximately9.3 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated real estate ventures.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-Q to square feet represent net rentable area.</p>
<ol>
<li>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consist solely of normal recurring matters, and result in a fair statement of the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024, the results of its operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Parent Company's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in their combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.</p>
<p>The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The Company's</p>
<p>Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies under Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" . There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, common development cost estimates for the Company's contributions to development joint ventures. The common development cost estimates for development joint venture contributions are highly judgmental, covering significant future time horizons and are sensitive to cost escalation, sales price escalation and absorption, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The new standard requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires companies to disclose all annual disclosures about segments in interim periods. The new standard also permits companies to disclose more than one measure of segment profit or loss, requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker, and requires companies with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by Topic 280. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and companies are required to apply the ASU retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.</p>

<li>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;</li>
<li>· Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and</li>
<li>· Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity or information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company determined the fair values disclosed below using available market information and discounted cash flow analyses as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The discount rate used in calculating fair value is the sum of the current risk free rate and the risk premium on the date of measurement of the instruments or obligations. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and to develop the related estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize upon disposition. The use of different estimates and valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts shown. The Company believes that the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets and liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses because they are short-term in duration. The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimates of fair value differ from the carrying amounts (in thousands):</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Carrying Amount (a) | Fair Value | Carrying Amount (a) | Fair Value |
| Unsecured notes payable | $ 1,486,215 | $ 1,396,547 | $ 1,486,052 | $ 1,386,621 |
| Variable rate debt | 453,003 | 412,377 | 410,932 | 370,665 |
| Secured fixed rate debt | 242,036 | 232,653 | 241,847 | 233,088 |</p>
<p>The Company used quoted market prices as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to value the unsecured notes payable and, as such, categorized them as Level 2.</p>
<p>The inputs utilized to determine the fair value of the Company's variable rate debt are categorized as Level 3. The fair value of the variable rate debt was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered borrowing rates available to the Company for loans with similar terms and characteristics.</p>
<p>The inputs utilized to determine fair value of the Company's notes receivable are unobservable and, as such, were categorized as Level 3. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered the contractual interest and principal payments discounted at a blended interest rate of the notes receivable.</p>
<p>For the Company's Level 3 financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed, an increase in the discount rate used to determine fair value would result in a decrease to the fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase to the fair value.</p>
<p>Disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments is based upon pertinent information available to management as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts were not comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since March 31, 2024. Current estimates of fair value may differ from the amounts presented herein.</p>

<p>The Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in "Other assets" and ("Other liabilities") on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that the inputs utilized to determine the fair value of derivative instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.</p>

<p>Unvested restricted units are considered participating securities which require the use of thetwo-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per unit. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, earnings representing nonforfeitable dividends were allocated to the unvested restricted units issued to the Parent Company's executives and other employees under the Parent Company's shareholder-approved long-term incentive plan.</p>
<h2>Common Partnership Units</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2024, the Operating Partnership declared a distribution of $0.15 per common partnership unit, totaling$0.1 million , which was paid on April 18, 2024 to unitholders of record as of April 4, 2024.</p>
<p>In connection with the Parent Company's common share repurchase program,one common unit of the Operating Partnership is retired for each common share repurchased. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any units.</p>

<h2>Restricted Share Unit Awards</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024,2,242,275 restricted share rights and units ("Restricted Share Units") were outstanding under the Company's long term equity incentive plan. These Restricted Share Units vest over one to three years from the initial grant dates. The remaining compensation expense to be recognized with respect to these awards at March 31, 2024 was $3.6 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of1.19 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortization related to outstanding Restricted Share Units was $3.9 million (of which $0.7 million was capitalized) and $2.8 million (of which $0.4 million was capitalized), respectively. Compensation expense related to outstanding Restricted Share Units is included in general and administrative expense.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Company's Restricted Share Units activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024:</p>
<p>| | Shares | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-vested at January 1, 2024 | 889,166 | $ 8.79 |
| Granted | 1,394,123 | $ 4.11 |
| Vested | (34,365) | $ 6.08 |
| Forfeited | (6,649) | $ 8.16 |
| Non-vested at March 31, 2024 | 2,242,275 | $ 5.92 |</p>
<p>On February 26, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Parent Company's Board of Trustees awarded to officers of the Company an aggregate o f 1,251,803 Restricted Share Units, which vest over three years from the grant date. Each Restricted Share Unit entitles the holder toone common share upon settlement. The Parent Company pays dividend equivalents on the</p>
<p>Restricted Share Units prior to the settlement date. Vesting and/or settlement would accelerate if the recipient of the award were to die, become disabled or, in the case of certain of such Restricted Share Units, retire in a qualifying retirement prior to the vesting or settlement date. Qualifying retirement generally means the recipient's voluntary termination of employment after reaching at least age 57 and accumulating at least 15 years of service with the Company. In addition, vesting would also accelerate if the Parent Company were to undergo a change of control and, on or before the first anniversary of the change of control, the recipient's employment were to cease due to a termination without cause or resignation with good reason.</p>
<p>The Restricted Share Units granted in 2024, 2023, and 2022 to certain senior executives include an "outperformance feature" whereby additional shares may be earned, up to 275% of the shares subject to the basic award, based on the Company's achievement of earnings-based targets and capital markets based targets during a three-year performance period with an additional 366 days of service generally required to fully vest. In addition to the basic award, up to an aggregate of2,669,293, 925,642, and 406,179 shares may be awarded under the outperformance feature for the 2024, 2023, and 2022 awards, respectively, to those senior officers whose Restricted Share Units awards include the "outperformance feature." As of March 31, 2024, the Company has not recognized any compensation expense related to the outperformance feature for the 2022 awards and has recognized $0.3 million and $0.5 million related to the outperformance feature for the 2024 and 2023 awards respectively. The Company will continue to evaluate progression towards achievement of the performance metrics on a quarterly basis and recognize compensation expense for the outperformance feature of these awards should it be determined that achievement of these metrics is probable.</p>
<p>In addition, on February 16, 2024, the Compensation Committee awarded non-officer employees an aggregate of142,320 Restricted Share Units that generally vest in three equal annual installments. Vesting of these awards is subject to acceleration upon death, disability or termination without cause withinone year following a change of control.</p>
<p>In accordance with the accounting standard for share-based compensation, the Company amortizes share-based compensation costs through the qualifying retirement dates for those executives who meet the conditions for qualifying retirement during the scheduled vesting period and whose award agreements provide for vesting upon a qualifying retirement or qualifying retirement eligibility.</p>
<h2>Restricted Performance Share Unit Awards</h2>
<p>The Compensation Committee of the Parent Company's Board of Trustees has granted performance share-based awards (referred to as Restricted Performance Share Units, or RPSUs) to officers of the Parent Company. The RPSUs are settled in common shares, with the number of common shares issuable in settlement varying between zero and 200% of the target amount based on the achievement of certain performance or market conditions. For 2022 and 2023 awards, the number of shares issuable is determined based on the Company's total shareholder return over specified measurement periods compared to total shareholder returns of comparative groups over the measurement periods ("Relative TSR"). For 2024 awards, the number of common shares issuable is determined based on the Company's achievement of certain operating metrics during three one-year performance periods, subject to further adjustment based on Relative TSR for thethree-year term of the award. The table below presents certain information as to unvested RPSU awards.</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | RPSU Grant Date | RPSU Grant Date | RPSU Grant Date | RPSU Grant Date |

| Measurement Period End Date | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2025 | 12/31/2026 | |
| Awarded Units | 516,852 | 1,057,173 | 1,251,803 | |
| Fair Value of Units on Grant Date (in thousands) | 6,872 | $ 7,125 | 1,715 | |</p>
<p>The Company values each RPSU on its grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair values of each award are being amortized over thethree-year performance period. If an award's service inception date precedes the grant date, we initially measure compensation expense for awards with performance conditions at fair value at the service inception date based on probability of payout, and we remeasure compensation expense at subsequent reporting dates until all of the award's key terms and conditions are known and the grant date is established. We amortize awards with performance conditions using the graded expense method.</p>
<p>For 2022 and 2023 awards, the performance period will be abbreviated and the determination and delivery of earned shares will be accelerated in the event of a change in control or if the recipient of the award were to die, become disabled or retire in a qualifying retirement prior to the end of the otherwise applicable three-year performance period; provided that, in the case of qualifying retirement, the number of shares deliverable will be pro-rated based on the portion of the performance period actually worked before retirement.</p>
<p>For 2024 awards, the Company awarded 1,251,803 shares of which 417,268 are granted in 2024. The determination and delivery of earned shares will be accelerated in the event of a change in control or the award recipient's death or disability before the end of the full three-year term of the award. If the award recipient's service ceases due to his or her qualifying retirement or disability during the term of the award, the award will remain outstanding and be earned based on actual performance for the full term of the award, subject to pro-ration based on the portion of the term actually worked. Dividend equivalents will be credited as additional RPSUs during the term of the awards, subject to the same terms and conditions as the original RPSUs.</p>
<p>For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized amortization of the 2024, 2023 and 2022 RPSU awards of $1.4 million, of which $0.2 million was capitalized consistent with the Company's policies for capitalizing eligible portions of employee compensation. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, amortization for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 RPSU awards was $1.4 million, of which $0.2 million was capitalized consistent with the Company's policies for capitalizing eligible portions of employee compensation.</p>
<p>The remaining compensation expense to be recognized with respect to the non-vested RPSUs at March 31, 2024 was approximately $10.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years.</p>
<p>The Company issued 164,461 common shares on February 1, 2023 in settlement of RPSUs that had been awarded on March 5, 2021 (with athree-year measurement period ended December 31, 2023). Holders of these RPSUs also received a cash dividend of $0.15 per share for these common shares on January 18, 2024.</p>

<p>Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as total property revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and thirdparty management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI presented by the Company may not be comparable to NOI reported by other companies that define NOI differently. NOI is the primary measure that is used by the Company's management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company's real estate assets by segment. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. The Company believes that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, to consolidated NOI, (in thousands):</p>

<li>COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The Company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters, including disputes with tenants, vendors and disputes arising out of agreements to purchase or sell properties. Given the nature of the Company's business activities, these lawsuits are considered routine to the conduct of its business. The result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted, because of the very nature of litigation, the litigation process and its adversarial nature, and the jury system. The Company will establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and when the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.</p>
<h2>Environmental</h2>
<p>As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. The Company's compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and the Company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect in the future. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on its current Properties or on properties that the Company may acquire.</p>
<h2>Debt Guarantees and Equity Funding Commitments</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company's unconsolidated real estate ventures had aggregate indebtedness of $1,438.0 million. These loans are generally mortgage loans or secured construction loans, most of which are nonrecourse to the Company, except for customary recourse carve-outs. In addition, during construction undertaken by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, including the 3025 JFK Venture, the 3151 Market Street Venture, and the One Uptown Ventures, the Company has provided, and expects to continue to provide, cost overrun and completion guarantees, as well as customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements.</p>
<p>In the agreement with its partner in the 3025 JFK Venture, the Company agreed to provide cost overrun and completion guarantees for the project under development. With respect to the construction loan obtained by 3025 JFK Venture on July 23, 2021, the Company has also provided a carry guarantee and limited payment guarantee up to 25% of the principal balance of the $186.7 million construction loan. The Company expects that it will be required to fund $5.7 million of additional equity through the project completion date.</p>
<p>In the agreement with its partner in the 3151 Market Street Venture, the Company agreed to provide cost overrun and completion guaranties for the project under development. As of March 31, 2024, total estimated costs to develop 3151 Market Street are approximately $316.9 million and as of such date, the Company has fully funded its share of equity. The partner is responsible for up to $22.9 million of additional construction costs. Thereafter, if a construction loan has not been obtained, the Company would be responsible to fund the balance of the development costs and would fund such costs through the use of its credit facilities and cash on hand.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>With respect to the One Uptown Ventures, the Company has provided completion guarantees and environmental indemnities in favor of its partner. In addition, the Company has provided completion guarantees, environmental indemnities and guarantees of exceptions to nonrecourse loan provisions in favor of the lenders for the One Uptown Ventures. Moreover, the Company has provided, in favor of the lenders, carry guarantees and limited payment guarantees up to 30% and 15% of the principal balance of the $121.7 million (office) and $85.0 million (multifamily) construction loans, respectively.</p>
<h2>Impact of Natural Disasters and Casualty</h2>
<p>The Company carries liability insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain losses, including those relating to property damage. The Company records the estimated amount of expected insurance proceeds for property damage and other losses incurred as an asset (typically a receivable from the insurer) and income up to the amount of the losses incurred when receipt of insurance proceeds is deemed probable. Any amount of insurance recovery in excess of the amount of the losses is considered a gain contingency and is not recorded until the proceeds are received.</p>
<h2>Other Commitments or Contingencies</h2>
<p>In connection with the Schuylkill Yards Project, the Company entered into a neighborhood engagement program and, as of March 31, 2024, had $5.6 million of future fixed contractual obligations. The Company also committed to fund additional contributions under the program. As of March 31, 2024, the Company estimates that these additional contributions, which are not fixed under the terms of agreement, will be $2.1 million.</p>
<p>The Company has also committed to contribute $15.0 million to a newly-formed venture capital fund that invests in early-stage life science companies.</p>
<p>The Company invests in its properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties. The Company believes that such expenditures enhance its competitiveness. The Company also enters into construction, utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year. These contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties.</p>

<h2>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<p>The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "1995 Act") provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other materials filed by us with the SEC (as well as information included in oral or other written statements made by us) contain statements that are forward-looking, including statements relating to business and real estate development activities, acquisitions, dispositions, future capital expenditures, financing sources, governmental regulation (including environmental regulation) and competition. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions of the 1995 Act. The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," "should" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forwardlooking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. As forward-looking statements, these statements involve important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are set forth in the " Risk Factors " section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.</p>
<p>The discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. The ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed, development properties placed in service and dispositions made during those periods.</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we owned and managed properties within four segments: (1) Philadelphia CBD, (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas, and (4) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Other segment includes properties located in the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, Southern Maryland, Camden County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware. In addition to the four segments, our corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development of certain real estate properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions.</p>
<p>We generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our Properties and, to a lesser extent, from the management and development of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, tenant creditworthiness, current and expected operating costs, the length of the lease term, vacancy levels and demand for space. We also generate cash through sales of assets, including assets that we do not view as core to our business plan, either because of location or expected growth potential, and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors.</p>
<p>Our financial and operating performance is dependent upon the demand for office, residential, parking, and retail space in our markets, our leasing results, our acquisition, disposition and development activity, our financing activity, our cash requirements and economic and market conditions, including prevailing interest rates.</p>
<p>Overall economic conditions, including but not limited to labor shortages, supply chain constraints, inflation, rising interest rates and deteriorating financial and credit markets, have had a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, including increases in past due accounts, tenant defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. These adverse conditions could impact our net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that the quality of our assets and the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to raise capital, if necessary, in various forms and from different sources, including through secured or unsecured loans from banks, pension funds and life insurance companies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds on terms that are economically attractive or at all.</p>
<p>We continue to seek revenue growth throughout our portfolio by increasing occupancy and rental rates. Occupancy at our Core Properties at March 31, 2024 was 87.7% compared to 89.0% at March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes selected operating and leasing statistics of our wholly owned properties for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:</p>

<p>In seeking to increase revenue through our operating, financing and investment activities, we also seek to minimize operating risks, including (i) tenant rollover risk, (ii) tenant credit risk and (iii) development risk.</p>
<h2>Tenant Rollover Risk</h2>
<p>We are subject to the risk that tenant leases, upon expiration, will not be renewed, that space may not be relet, or that the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations) may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms. Leases that accounted for approximately 3.3% of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of March 31, 2024 (representing approximately 4.4% of the occupied rentable square feet of the properties) are scheduled to expire without penalty during the remainder of 2024. We maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals. If we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases, at anticipated rental rates, or if our tenants terminate their leases early, our cash flow would be adversely impacted.</p>
<h2>Tenant Credit Risk</h2>
<p>In the event of a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Our management evaluates our accrued rent receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions. Our accrued rent receivable allowance was $2.4 million or 1.3% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of March 31, 2024, compared to $2.7 million or 1.4% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>If economic conditions deteriorate, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, we may experience increases in past due accounts, defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. These conditions would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.</p>
<h2>Development Risk</h2>
<p>Development projects are subject to a variety of risks, including construction delays, construction cost overruns, building moratoriums, inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, inability to lease space at projected rates, inability to enter into construction, development and other agreements on favorable terms, and unexpected environmental and other hazards.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the following active development project, within our consolidated portfolio, remains under construction in progress (dollars, in thousands):</p>

<p>As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the 3151 Market Street Venture has not secured a construction loan. Under the partnership agreement with our partner in this real estate venture, after our partner has funded the remaining balance of its capital commitment, as shown in the table above, then, until a construction loan has been obtained, we will be obligated to fund the balance of construction costs incurred in the project development.</p>
<h2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and current economic conditions.</p>
<p>Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. We believe that presentation of our consolidated financial information, without a breakdown by segment, will effectively present important information useful to our investors.</p>
<p>Net operating income ("NOI") as presented in the comparative analysis below is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use internally to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate assets by segment, as presented in Note 13, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements, and of our business as a whole. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. See Note 13, "Segment Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our consolidated net income as defined by GAAP.</p>
<h2>Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023</h2>
<p>The following comparison for the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2023, makes reference to the effect of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) "Same Store Property Portfolio," which represents 68 properties containing an aggregate of approximately 12.4 million net rentable square feet, and represents properties that we owned and consolidated for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Same Store Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2023 and owned and consolidated through March 31, 2024, excluding properties classified as held for sale,</li>

<h2>Total Revenue</h2>
<p>Rents from the Total Portfolio decreased primarily as a result of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· $2.4 million decrease due to the sales of 8521 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA in the fourth quarter of 2023, 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA and Three Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023;</li>
<li>· $1.1 million decrease due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in the third quarter of 2023;</li>
<li>· $3.0 million increase related to our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties which comprise 250 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA and 2340 Dulles Corner Boulevard, Herndon VA;</li>
<li>· $2.0 million increase related to 405 Colorado, Austin TX stabilized in second quarter of 2023; and</li>
<li>· $0.3 million decrease due to net changes in leasing activity within the remainder of the portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Property Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>Property operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of the sale of 8521 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, VA in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the sales of 200 North Radnor Chester Road, Radnor, PA and Three Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023 and due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Real Estate Taxes</h2>
<p>Real estate taxes decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in tax assessments in 2024 compared to 2023 on properties in our Austin Texas segment.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased deferred compensation expense.</p>
<h2>Interest Expense</h2>
<p>Interest expense increased primarily due to the effect of the $245 million secured term loan we closed in March 2023, the proceeds from which were applied to reduce then outstanding balance under our unsecured line of credit and obtained an additional $70 million of unsecured financing in March 2023 resulting in higher leverage at higher interest rates over the prior period. Additionally, as a result of the Moody's downgrade in the third quarter of 2023 and S&amp;P downgrade in the first quarter of 2024, the interest rate on our 2028 Notes increased in September 2023 and March 2024 to 8.05% due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the 2028 Notes.</p>
<h2>Equity in Income of Real Estate Ventures</h2>
<p>The increased losses from our unconsolidated real estate ventures are primarily due to higher interest rates on the ventures' outstanding indebtedness and net losses from the 3025 JFK Venture being put into service in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>Our principal liquidity funding needs for the next twelve months are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· normal recurring expenses;</li>
<li>· capital expenditures, including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs;</li>
<li>· debt service and principal repayment obligations;</li>
<li>· current development and redevelopment costs;</li>
<li>· commitments to unconsolidated real estate ventures;</li>
<li>· distributions to shareholders to maintain our REIT status;</li>
<li>· possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interest therein; and</li>
<li>· possible common share repurchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· cash flows from operations;</li>
<li>· distributions of cash from our unconsolidated real estate ventures;</li>
<li>· cash and cash equivalent balances;</li>
<li>· availability under our Unsecured Credit Facility;</li>
<li>· secured construction loans and long-term unsecured indebtedness;</li>
<li>· sales of real estate or contributions of interests in real estate to joint ventures; and</li>
<li>· issuances of Parent Company equity securities and/or units of the Operating Partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Parent Company owned a 99.7% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest of approximately 0.3% pertains to common limited partnership interests owned by non-affiliated investors who contributed property to the Operating Partnership in exchange for their interests. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day operations and management. The Parent Company's source of funding for its dividend payments and other obligations is the distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.</p>
<p>As summarized above, we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through available cash balances and cash flows from operations, financing activities and real estate sales. Rental revenue and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our revenue also includes third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows. With uncertain economic conditions, vacancy rates may increase, effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may decrease and tenant installation costs, including concessions, may increase in most or all of our markets during the remainder of 2024 and possibly beyond. As a result, our revenues and cash flows could be insufficient to cover operating expenses, including increased tenant installation costs, pay debt service or make distributions to shareholders over the short-term. If this situation were to occur, we expect that we would finance cash deficits through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and other sources of debt and equity financings. In addition, a material adverse change in cash provided by operations could adversely affect our compliance with financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility, including unsecured term loans and unsecured notes. As of March 31, 2024 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and requirement obligations.</p>
<p>On April 12, 2024, we completed an underwritten offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875% Guaranteed Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes"). The 2029 Notes were priced at approximately 99.51% of their face amount. We received approximately $391.8 million of net proceeds after the deduction for underwriting discounts and offering expenses.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2024, the Company commenced a tender offer (the "Tender Offer") for any and all of the outstanding $335.1 million principal amount of its 4.10% Guaranteed Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). The purchase price offered per $1,000 principal amount of 2024 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer was determined by reference to the fixed spread for the 2024 Notes of 0 basis points plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the 4.250% U.S. Treasury due September 30, 2024. The Tender Offer expired on April 19, 2024. Upon completion of the Tender Offer, on April 23, 2024, the Company issued a redemption notice to redeem any 2024 Notes that remained outstanding after the Tender Offer. The expected redemption date is June 7, 2024.</p>
<p>Our outstanding 7.55% Guaranteed Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes") include an interest rate adjustment provision whereby the interest rate payable on the 2028 Notes is subject to a 25 basis point adjustment if either Moody's Investors Services Inc, and its successors ("Moody's"), or S&amp;P Global Ratings, and its successors ("S&amp;P") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the 2028 Notes. During the third quarter of 2023, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 7.80% in September 2023. In January 2024, S&amp;P downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB- to BB+. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on the 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points to 8.05% in March 2024.</p>
<p>Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the value of our unencumbered assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our unsecured credit rating, our access to the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan would increase.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, our senior unsecured credit ratings and outlook were as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | Moody's | S&amp;P |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-term debt | Ba1 | BB+ |
| Outlook | Negative | Negative |</p>
<p>If our credit ratings are lowered further, our ability to access the public debt markets, our costs of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit ratings agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same.</p>
<p>The Parent Company unconditionally guarantees the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt obligations, which, as of March 31, 2024, amounted to $1,925.6 million. The Operating Partnership's secured debt obligations as of March 31, 2024 amounted to $263.9 million</p>
<h2>Capital Markets</h2>
<p>The Parent Company issues equity from time to time, the proceeds of which it contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in the Operating Partnership, and guarantees debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company's ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about the Company as a whole and the current trading price of the Parent Company's shares. The Parent Company maintains a shelf registration statement that covers the offering and sale of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants and unsecured debt securities. Subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws, and if warranted by market conditions, we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement or in transactions exempt from registration.</p>
<p>See Note 11, "Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our share repurchase program. We expect to fund any additional share repurchases with a combination of available cash balances and availability under our unsecured credit facility. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, share prices, capital availability and other factors as determined by our management team. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.</p>
<h2>Capital Recycling</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, we had $43.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $523.7 million of available borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, net of $39.3 million in letters of credit outstanding. Based on the foregoing, as well as cash flows from operations net of dividend requirements, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. We expect that our primary uses of capital during the remainder of 2024 will be to fund our current development and redevelopment projects.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows</h2>
<p>The following discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows and is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $51.3 million and $67.5 million, respectively. We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows (in thousands):</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activity | 2024 | 2023 | (Decrease) Increase |

| Net cash flows | $ (16,235) | $ 94,684 | $ (110,919) |</p>
<p>Our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our Properties. Our Properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with the resources to fund operating expenses, debt service and quarterly dividends.</p>
<p>Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing, and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, the change in investing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands):</p>
<p>| | (Decrease) Increase |
| --- | --- |
| Capital expenditures and capitalized interest | 5,018 |
| Capital improvements/acquisition deposits/leasing costs | (2,583) |
| Joint venture investments | (16,348) |
| Capital distributions from unconsolidated real estate ventures | 3,631 |
| Increase in net cash used in investing activities | $ (10,282) |</p>
<p>We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, unsecured and secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and construction loans. From time to time, we may issue common or preferred shares of beneficial interest, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, the change in financing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands):</p>
<p>| | (Decrease) Increase |
| --- | --- |
| Proceeds from debt obligations | $ (387,924) |
| Repayments of debt obligations | 257,801 |
| Dividends and distributions paid | 6,778 |
| Debt financing costs paid | 4,214 |

<h2>Unsecured Debt</h2>
<p>The Operating Partnership is the issuer of our unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. The indenture under which the Operating Partnership issued its unsecured notes contains financial covenants, including: (i) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%; (ii) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40%; (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iv) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The charter documents of the Parent Company and Operating Partnership do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that the Operating Partnership may incur, and its policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of the Parent</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Company's Board of Trustees, subject to the financial covenants in the credit agreement for our Unsecured Credit Facility, the indenture for our unsecured notes and in our other credit agreements.</p>
<h2>Equity</h2>
<p>In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Parent Company is required to, among other things, pay dividends to its shareholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. See Note 11, "Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our dividends declared for the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Inflation</h2>
<p>Substantially all our leases are structured as base year or triple net leases which provide for reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, approximately 96% of our leases (as a percentage of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our wholly-owned portfolio) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% per lease year) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. However, recent inflation and higher interest rates has caused an increase in our borrowing costs, including on our variable rate debt.</p>
<h2>Other Contractual Obligations</h2>
<p>We provide customary guarantees for certain development projects of our unconsolidated real estate ventures. See Note 15 "Commitments and Contingencies," to our Consolidated Financial Statement for further details on payment guarantees provided on behalf of our real estate ventures and refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our contractual obligations.</p>
<h2>Funds from Operations (FFO)</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the revised definition of FFO adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate FFO by adjusting net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated real estate ventures. Our calculation of FFO includes gains from sale of undepreciated real estate and other assets, considered incidental to our main business, to third parties or unconsolidated real estate ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the use of FFO combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REITs' operating results more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding property impairments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.</p>
<p>We consider net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO. While FFO and FFO per unit are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common unitholders to FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:</p>

<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</h2>
<p>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, our ability to make distributions or payments to our shareholders. While we have not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or continued economic slowdown, defaults could increase and result in losses to us which would adversely affect our operating results and liquidity.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk and Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Operating Partnership's financial instruments to selected changes in market rates. The range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen.</p>
<p>Our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt. As of March 31, 2024, our consolidated debt consisted of (i) unsecured notes with an outstanding principal balance of $1,490.0 million, all of which are fixed rate borrowings, (ii) variable rate debt consisting of trust preferred securities that have been swapped to fixed rates with an outstanding principal balance of $78.6 million, (iii) a $600.0 million revolving credit facility with an outstanding principal balance of $37.0 million , (iv) a secured fixed rate term loan with an outstanding principal balance of $245.0 million and (v) two unsecured term loans of $250.0 million and $70.0 million. The $250.0 million unsecured term loan has been swapped to a fixed rate. All financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position.</p>
<p>If market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would increase by approximately $7.9 million. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately $8.2 million.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, the fair value of our unsecured notes was $1,396.5 million. For sensitivity purposes, a 100basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately $14.0 million at March 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>From time to time or as the need arises, we use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. The total outstanding principal balance of our variable rate debt was approximately $454.5 million as of March 31, 2024. The total fair value of our variable rate debt was approximately $412.4 million at March 31, 2024. For sensitivity purposes, if market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points the fair value of our variable rate debt would decrease by approximately $13.2 million at March 31, 2024. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of our outstanding variable rate debt would increase by approximately $13.9 million at March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.</p>
