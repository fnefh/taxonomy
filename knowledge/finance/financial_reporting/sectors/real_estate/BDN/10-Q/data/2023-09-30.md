## EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 of Brandywine Realty Trust (the "Parent Company") and Brandywine Operating Partnership L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"). The Parent Company is a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the "Company". In addition, as used in this report, terms such as "we", "us", and "our" may refer to the Company, the Parent Company, or the Operating Partnership.

The Parent Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of September 30, 2023, owned a 99.7% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.3% interest consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership's day-to-day operations and management.

Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership.

As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company's operations on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into a single report will:

- · facilitate a better understanding by the investors of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;
- · remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership; and
- · create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

There are few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the footnote disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as an interrelated consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time (and contributing the net proceeds of such issuances to the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing the debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in the real estate ventures described below. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company's business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company's business through the Operating Partnership's operations, by the Operating Partnership's incurrence of indebtedness (directly and through subsidiaries) and through the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership or equity interests in subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.

The equity and non-controlling interests in the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership's equity are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements while the common units of limited partnership interests held by parties other than the Parent Company are presented as non-controlling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements. The differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership's equity relate to the differences in the equity issued at the Parent Company and Operating Partnership levels.

To help investors understand the significant differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following as separate notes or sections for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership:

## Table of Contents

- · Consolidated Financial Statements; and
- · Notes to the Parent Company's and Operating Partnership's Equity.

This report also includes separate Item 4. (Controls and Procedures) disclosures and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Parent Company and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and 18 U.S.C. § 1350.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosures of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to such disclosures as those of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and real estate ventures and holds assets and incurs debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and the Parent Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership.

## 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

## Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consist solely of normal recurring matters, and result in a fair statement of the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Parent Company's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in their combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023.

The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date but does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies under Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" . There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies since December 31, 2022.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, common development cost estimates for the Company's contributions to development joint ventures. The common development cost estimates for development joint venture contributions are highly judgmental, covering significant future time horizons and are sensitive to cost escalation, sales price escalation and absorption, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.

## 3. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the gross carrying value of the operating properties was as follows (in thousands):

## Dispositions

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company deconsolidated $7.8 million recorded in "Prepaid leasehold interests in land held for development, net" on the consolidated balance sheets. This deconsolidation reflects the Company's contribution, in January 2023, of 200,000 square feet of buildable floor to area ratio ("FAR") to the Company's unconsolidated real estate venture, for use by this unconsolidated real estate venture in the development of 3151 Market Street, a life science project located in Philadelphia. Upon contribution at fair market value, we recognized a gain, net of transaction costs, of $0.8 million in "Net gain on sale of undepreciated real estate" on the consolidated statements of operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold Three Barton Skyway, a173,302 square foot office building located in Austin, TX for $53.3 million.

## 8. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

- · Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;
- · Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and
- · Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity or information.

The Company determined the fair values disclosed below using available market information and discounted cash flow analyses as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The discount rate used in calculating fair value is the sum of the current risk free rate and the risk premium on the date of measurement of the instruments or obligations. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and to develop the related estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates

presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize upon disposition. The use of different estimates and valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts shown. The Company believes that the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 approximate the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets and liabilities, accounts payable and accrued expenses because they are short-term in duration. The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimates of fair value differ from the carrying amounts (in thousands):

The Company used quoted market prices as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 to value the unsecured notes payable and, as such, categorized them as Level 2.

The inputs utilized to determine the fair value of the Company's variable rate debt are categorized as Level 3. The fair value of the variable rate debt was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered borrowing rates available to the Company for loans with similar terms and characteristics.

The inputs utilized to determine fair value of the Company's notes receivable are unobservable and, as such, were categorized

as Level 3. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered the contractual interest and principal payments discounted at a blended interest rate of the notes receivable.

For the Company's Level 3 financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed, an increase in the discount rate used to determine fair value would result in a decrease to the fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase to the fair value.

Disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments is based upon pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts were not comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2023. Current estimates of fair value may differ from the amounts presented herein.

## 9. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The notional amounts provide an indication of the extent of the Company's involvement in these instruments at that time, but do not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (amounts presented in thousands).

|                      |               |               | $ 250,000         | $                 | 250,000    |                            |                            |                            |                            |

The Company measures its derivative instruments at fair value and records them in "Other assets" and ("Other liabilities") on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the

Company has determined that the inputs utilized to determine the fair value of derivative instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

## 10. LIMITED PARTNERS' NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE PARENT COMPANY

Noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements relate to redeemable common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership held by parties other than the Parent Company and properties which are consolidated but not wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership.

## Operating Partnership

Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as total revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third-party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI presented by the Company may not be comparable to NOI reported by other companies that define NOI differently. NOI is the primary measure that is used by the Company's management to evaluate the operating performance of the Company's real estate assets by segment. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. The Company believes that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, to consolidated NOI, (in thousands):

## 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters, including disputes with tenants, vendors and disputes arising out of agreements to purchase or sell properties. Given the nature of the Company's business activities, these lawsuits are considered routine to the conduct of its business. The result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted, because of the very nature of litigation, the litigation process and its adversarial nature, and the jury system. The Company will establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and when the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

## Environmental

As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. The Company's compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and the Company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect in the future. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on its current Properties or on properties that the Company may acquire.

## Debt Guarantees and Equity Funding Commitments

As of September 30, 2023, the Company's unconsolidated real estate ventures had aggregate indebtedness of $1,384.0 million. These loans are generally mortgage loans or secured construction loans, most of which are nonrecourse to the Company, except for customary recourse carve-outs. In addition, during construction undertaken by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, including the 3025 JFK Venture, the 3151 Market Street Venture, and the One Uptown Ventures, the Company has provided, and expects to continue to provide, cost overrun and completion guarantees, as well as customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements.

In the agreement with its partner in the 3025 JFK Venture, the Company agreed to provide cost overrun and completion guarantees for the project under development. With respect to the construction loan obtained by 3025 JFK Venture on July 23, 2021, the Company has also provided a carry guarantee and limited payment guarantee up to 25% of the principal balance of the $186.7 million construction loan. The Company expects that it will be required to fund $5.8 million of additional equity through the project completion date.

## Table of Contents

In the agreement with its partner in the 3151 Market Street Venture, the Company agreed to provide cost overrun and completion guaranties for the project under development. As of September 30, 2023, total estimated costs to develop 3151 Market Street are approximately $316.9 million and as of such date, the Company has fully funded its share of equity. The partner is responsible for up to $22.9 million of additional construction costs. Thereafter, if a construction loan has not been obtained, the Company would be responsible to fund the balance of the development costs and would fund such costs through the use of its credit facilities and cash on hand.

With respect to the One Uptown Ventures, the Company has provided completion guarantees and environmental indemnities in favor of its partner. In addition, the Company has provided to completion guarantees, environmental indemnities and guarantees of exceptions to nonrecourse loan provisions in favor of the lenders for the One Uptown Venture. Moreover, the Company has provided, in favor of the lenders, carry guarantees and limited payment guarantees up to 30% and 15% of the principal balance of the $121.7 million (office) and $85.0 million (multifamily) construction loans, respectively. The Company expects that it will be required to fund $4.0 million of additional equity for the office component of the project through the project completion date.

## Impact of Natural Disasters and Casualty

The Company carries liability insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain losses, including those relating to property damage. The Company records the estimated amount of expected insurance proceeds for property damage and other losses incurred as an asset (typically a receivable from the insurer) and income up to the amount of the losses incurred when receipt of insurance proceeds is deemed probable. Any amount of insurance recovery in excess of the amount of the losses is considered a gain contingency and is not recorded until the proceeds are received.

## Other Commitments or Contingencies

In connection with the Schuylkill Yards Project, the Company entered into a neighborhood engagement program and, as of September 30, 2023, had $6.6 million of future fixed contractual obligations. The Company also committed to fund additional contributions under the program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company estimates that these additional contributions, which are not fixed under the terms of agreement, will be $2.2 million.

The Company invests in its properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties. The Company believes that such expenditures enhance its competitiveness. The Company also enters into construction, utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year. These contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties.

## Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "1995 Act") provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other materials filed by us with the SEC (as well as information included in oral or other written statements made by us) contain statements that are forward-looking, including statements relating to business and real estate development activities, acquisitions, dispositions, future capital expenditures, financing sources, governmental regulation (including environmental regulation) and competition. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions of the 1995 Act. The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," "should" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forwardlooking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. As forward-looking statements, these statements involve important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are set forth in the " Risk Factors " section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.

The discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. The ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed, development properties placed in service and dispositions made during those periods.

## OVERVIEW

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we owned and managed properties within four segments: (1) Philadelphia CBD, (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas, and (4) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Other segment includes properties located in the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, Southern Maryland, Camden County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware. In addition to the four segments, our corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development of certain real estate properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions.

We generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our Properties and, to a lesser extent, from the management and development of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the unconsolidated real estate ventures. Factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, tenant creditworthiness, current and expected operating costs, the length of the lease term, vacancy levels and demand for space. We also generate cash through sales of assets, including assets that we do not view as core to our business plan, either because of location or expected growth potential, and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors.

Our financial and operating performance is dependent upon the demand for office, residential, parking, and retail space in our markets, our leasing results, our acquisition, disposition and development activity, our financing activity, our cash requirements and economic and market conditions, including prevailing interest rates.

Overall economic conditions, including but not limited to labor shortages, supply chain constraints, inflation, rising interest rates and deteriorating financial and credit markets, could have a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, including increases in past due accounts, tenant defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. These adverse conditions could impact our net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that the quality of our assets and the strength of our balance sheet will enable us to raise capital, if necessary, in various forms and from different sources, including through secured or unsecured loans from banks, pension funds and life insurance companies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds on terms that are economically attractive or at all.

We continue to seek revenue growth throughout our portfolio by increasing occupancy and rental rates. Occupancy at our Core Properties at September 30, 2023 was 88.3% compared to 90.8% at September 30, 2022.

The table below summarizes selected operating and leasing statistics of our wholly owned properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:

In seeking to increase revenue through our operating, financing and investment activities, we also seek to minimize operating risks, including (i) tenant rollover risk, (ii) tenant credit risk and (iii) development risk.

## Tenant Rollover Risk

We are subject to the risk that tenant leases, upon expiration, will not be renewed, that space may not be relet, or that the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of renovations) may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms. Leases that accounted for approximately 1.2% of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of September 30, 2023 (representing approximately 1.6% of the net rentable square feet of the properties) are scheduled to expire without penalty during the remainder of 2023. We maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals. If we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases, at anticipated rental rates, or if our tenants terminate their leases early, our cash flow would be adversely impacted.

## Tenant Credit Risk

In the event of a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Our management evaluates our accrued rent receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions. Our accrued rent receivable allowance was $3.2 million or 1.7% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of September 30, 2023, compared to $3.9 million or 2.1% of our accrued rent receivable balance as of December 31, 2022.

If economic conditions deteriorate, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, we may experience increases in past due accounts, defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents. These conditions would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

## Development Risk

Development projects are subject to a variety of risks, including construction delays, construction cost overruns, building moratoriums, inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, inability to lease space at projected rates, inability to enter into construction, development and other agreements on favorable terms, and unexpected environmental and other hazards.

As of September 30, 2023, the following active development and redevelopment projects, within our consolidated portfolio, remain under construction in progress (dollars, in thousands):

## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and current economic conditions.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2022.

## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. We believe that presentation of our consolidated financial information, without a breakdown by segment, will effectively present important information useful to our investors.

Net operating income ("NOI") as presented in the comparative analysis below is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and third party management expenses. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities, property-level salaries, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, and management fees. General and administrative expenses that are not reflected in NOI primarily consist of corporate-level salaries, amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use internally to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate assets by segment, as presented in Note 13, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements, and of our business as a whole. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. While NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. NOI does not reflect interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. See Note 13, "Segment Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our consolidated net income as defined by GAAP.

## Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022

The following comparison for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2022, makes reference to the effect of the following:

- (a) "Same Store Property Portfolio," which represents 69 properties containing an aggregate of approximately 12.4 million net rentable square feet, and represents properties that we owned and consolidated for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Same Store Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to July 1, 2022 and owned and consolidated through September 30, 2023, excluding properties classified as held for sale,

- (c) "Recently Completed/Acquired Properties," which represents two properties placed into service or acquired on or subsequent to July 1, 2022,
- (d) "Development/Redevelopment Properties," which represents three properties currently in development/redevelopment. A property is excluded from our Same Store Property Portfolio and moved into Development/Redevelopment in the period that we determine to proceed with development/redevelopment for a future development strategy, and

## Equity in Income of Real Estate Ventures

The increased losses from our joint ventures is primarily due to higher interest rates on the ventures' outstanding indebtedness.

## Total Revenue

Rents from the Total Portfolio increased primarily as a result of the following:

- · $9.7 million increase related to our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties which comprise 405 Colorado, Austin, TX and 250 King of Prussia Road, Radnor, PA;
- · $5.4 million increase related to new lease commencements, net of rollover, from July 2022 to September 2023;
- · $4.4 million decrease due to the sales of T hree Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023 and 200 Barr Harbor Drive in the fourth quarter of 2022; and
- · $2.1 decrease due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment in the third quarter of 2023 and removing one building from service in our Philadelphia CBD segment in the third quarter of 2022.

Other income decreased primarily as a result of the following:

- · A decrease of $1.4 million of excess insurance proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in comparison to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we

- received $1.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of excess insurance proceeds relating to a property in our Austin, Texas segment;
- · $2.2 million of settlement proceeds received from a general contractor for liquidated damages as a result of a construction delay at a property in our Austin, Texas segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2022; and
- · $0.5 million offset related non-rental or fee income activities.

## Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the following:

- · $3.7 million increase due to the placement into service of our Recently Completed/Acquired Properties;
- · $2.9 million increase related to accelerated depreciation on the tenant improvements due to the early termination of a single tenant occupant at a property in our Austin, Texas segment;
- · $2.4 million increase related to tenant improvements placed into service, made up of $1.7 million in the Philadelphia CBD segment and $0.7 million in the Other segment;
- · $0.8 million increase due to the partial placement into service of our redevelopment property; and
- · $1.4 million decrease due to the sales of T hree Barton Skyway, Austin, TX in the third quarter of 2023 and 20 0 Barr Harbor Drive in the fourth quarter of 2022; and
- · $1.3 million decrease due to removing two buildings from service,on e in our Austin, Texas segment in the third quarter of 2023 and on e in our Philadelphia CBD segment in the third quarter of 2022.

## Provision for Impairment

During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a provision for impairment of $11.7 million on an office property located in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment. See Note 3 "Real Estate Investments," for further information.

During the second quarter of 2023, we recognized a provision for impairment of $4.5 million on an office property located in our Austin Texas, segment which met the held for sale criteria as of June 30, 2023 and was sold during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

## Net Gain on Sale of Undepreciated Real Estate

The gain of $0.8 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is related to the contribution of a prepaid leasehold interest to the 3151 Market Street Venture at fair value.

The gain of $8.0 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily related to the sale of a portfolio of eight parcels of land and three operating properties in our Other segment, resulting in $5.4 million gain. An additional $2.6 million is related the formation of the 3151 Market Street Venture, which resulted in deconsolidation of the project and recognition of our investment in the real estate venture at fair value.

## Interest Expense

Interest expense increased primarily due to a full quarter of our interest incurred on our 2028 Bonds (issued in December 2022), which carry an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum compared to the retired 2023 Bonds, which carried an effective interest rate of 3.865% per annum. In addition, we closed on our $245 million secured term loan which paid down our line of credit and obtained another $70 million unsecured term loan in March 2023, resulting in higher leverage at higher interest rates over the prior period.

## Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

The increased losses from our joint ventures is primarily due to higher interest rates on the outstanding indebtedness of the ventures and a $0.9 million decrease associated with our former 1919 Market Venture where the underlying property was sold in the fourth quarter of 2022.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

## General

Our principal liquidity funding needs for the next twelve months are as follows:

- · normal recurring expenses;
- · capital expenditures, including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs;
- · debt service and principal repayment obligations;
- · current development and redevelopment costs;
- · commitments to unconsolidated real estate ventures;
- · distributions to shareholders to maintain our REIT status;
- · possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interest therein; and
- · possible common share repurchases.

We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:

- · cash flows from operations;
- · distributions of cash from our unconsolidated real estate ventures;
- · cash and cash equivalent balances;
- · availability under our Unsecured Credit Facility;
- · secured construction loans and long-term unsecured indebtedness;
- · sales of real estate or contributions of interests in real estate to joint ventures; and
- · issuances of Parent Company equity securities and/or units of the Operating Partnership.

As of September 30, 2023, the Parent Company owned a 99.7% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining interest of approximately 0.3% pertains to common limited partnership interests owned by non-affiliated investors who contributed property to the Operating Partnership in exchange for their interests. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership's day-to-day operations and management. The Parent Company's source of funding for its dividend payments and other obligations is the distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership.

As summarized above, we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through available cash balances and cash flows from operations, financing activities and real estate sales. Rental revenue and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our revenue also includes third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows. With uncertain economic conditions, vacancy rates may increase, effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may decrease and tenant installation costs, including concessions, may increase in most or all of our markets during the remainder of 2023 and possibly beyond. As a result, our revenues and cash flows could be insufficient to cover operating expenses, including increased tenant installation costs, pay debt service or make distributions to shareholders over the short-term. If this situation were to occur, we expect that we would finance cash deficits through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and other sources of debt and equity financings. In addition, a material adverse change in cash provided by operations could adversely affect our compliance with financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility, including unsecured term loans and unsecured notes. As of September 30, 2023 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and requirement obligations.

On January 19, 2023, we closed on a term loan secured by seven operating properties with an aggregate principal amount of $245.0 million (the "Secured Facility"). The Secured Facility matures on February 6, 2028. We used the net proceeds from the Secured Facility for general corporate purposes, including to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company's Unsecured Credit Facility. On January 20, 2023, we completed the redemption of our then remaining $54.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes. See Note 7, "Debt Obligations," for further information.

On March 1, 2023, we closed on an unsecured term loan with a principal amount of $70.0 million (the "Unsecured Term Facility"). The loan has a scheduled maturity date of February 28, 2024 with an option to extend for twelve months and bears interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.75% with a 0.10% SOFR adjustment. See Note 7, "Debt Obligations," for further information. We use multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. When needed, we use borrowings under our Unsecured Credit Facility for general business purposes, including to meet debt maturities and to fund distributions to shareholders as well as for development and acquisition costs and other expenses. In light of the volatility in financial markets and economic uncertainties, it is possible that one or more lenders under our Unsecured Credit Facility could fail to fund a

borrowing request. Such an event could adversely affect our ability to access funds under our Unsecured Credit Facility when needed to fund distributions or pay expenses.

On August 15, 2023, we entered into a construction loan agreement secured by the development project at 155 King of Prussia Road in Radnor, Pennsylvania in the aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the "Construction Loan"). The Construction Loan has a scheduled maturity date of August 16, 2026 with an option to prepay at any time without a fee, premium or penalty. The Construction Loan bears interest at SOFR plus 2.5%.

Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the value of our unencumbered assets, our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our unsecured credit rating, our access to the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loan would increase.

Our $350 million 7.55% Guaranteed Notes due 2028 ("2028 Notes") includes an interest rate adjustment provision whereby the interest rate payable on the notes is subject to an 25 basis point adjustment if either Moody's Investors Services Inc, and its successors, ("Moody's") or S&P Global Ratings, and its successors ("S&P") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the 2028 Notes. During the third quarter of 2023, Moody's downgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. As a result of the downgrade, the interest rate on our 2028 Notes increased 25 basis points in September 2023 due to the coupon adjustment provisions within the note.

As of September 30, 2023, our senior unsecured credit ratings and outlook were as follows:

Table of Contents

|                | Moody's   | S&P      |
|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Long-term debt | Ba1       | BBB-     |
| Outlook        | Negative  | Negative |

If our credit ratings are lowered further, our ability to access the public debt markets, our costs of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit ratings agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same.

The Parent Company unconditionally guarantees the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt obligations, which, as of September 30, 2023, amounted to $1,898.6 million. We have $245.0 million of debt obligations secured by seven of our wholly-owned portfolio as of September 30, 2023.

## Capital Markets

The Parent Company issues equity from time to time, the proceeds of which it contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in the Operating Partnership, and guarantees debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company's ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on, among other things, general market conditions for REITs, market perceptions about the Company as a whole and the current trading price of the Parent Company's shares. The Parent Company maintains a shelf registration statement that covers the offering and sale of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants and unsecured debt securities. Subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws, and if warranted by market conditions, we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement or in transactions exempt from registration.

See Note 11, "Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our share repurchase program. We expect to fund any additional share repurchases with a combination of available cash balances and availability under our unsecured credit facility. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, share prices, capital availability and other factors as determined by our management team. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

## Capital Recycling

The Operating Partnership also considers net sales of selected properties and recapitalization of unconsolidated real estate ventures as additional sources of managing its liquidity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we contributed to the 3151 Market Street Venture 200,000 square feet of FAR, which represents buildable density, at the project site, and, upon contribution at fair market value, recognized a gain, net of transaction costs, of $0.8 million.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Three Barton Skyway, a 173,302 square foot office building located in Austin, TX for $53.3 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

As of September 30, 2023, we had $47.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $557.6 million of available borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, net of $42.4 million in letters of credit outstanding. Based on the foregoing, as well as cash flows from operations net of dividend requirements, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. We expect that our primary uses of capital during the remainder of 2023 will be to fund our current development and redevelopment projects.

## Cash Flows

The following discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows and is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented.

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we maintained cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $58.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows (in thousands):

Our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our Properties. Our Properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with the resources to fund operating expenses, debt service and quarterly dividends.

Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing, and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the change in investing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands):

|                                                                | (Decrease) Increase   |

| Decrease in net cash used in investing activities              | $ 115,949             |

We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, property-level financing, unsecured and secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and construction loans. From time to time, we may issue common or preferred shares of beneficial interest, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the change in financing cash flows was due to the following activities (in thousands):

## Unsecured Debt

The Operating Partnership is the issuer of our unsecured notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. The indenture under which the Operating Partnership issued its unsecured notes contains financial covenants, including: (i) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%; (ii) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40%; (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iv) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2023.

The charter documents of the Parent Company and Operating Partnership do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that the Operating Partnership may incur, and its policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of the Parent Company's Board of Trustees, subject to the financial covenants in the credit agreement for our Unsecured Credit Facility, the indenture for our unsecured notes and in our other credit agreements.

## Investments in Joint Ventures

## Mid-Atlantic Office Venture

The Company holds a 40% interest (25% preferred and 15% common) in the Mid-Atlantic Office Venture. As of September 30, 2023, the Company's aggregate investment in this venture was $28.3 million and is reflected in the line item on the consolidated balance sheets "Investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures."The Company has no obligation to fund additional equity to the Mid-Atlantic Office Venture. The properties held by the Mid-Atlantic Office Venture are encumbered by a $132.8 million secured mortgage loan that is scheduled to mature in January 2024 and is nonrecourse to the Company. The Company and its partner are in active discussions, including with the mortgage lender, as to a potential extension of the loan or other restructuring of the venture. At present, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions.

## Rockpoint Venture

The Company holds a 15% interest in the Rockpoint Venture and, as of September 30, 2023, the Company's investment in this venture, reflected in the line item on the consolidated balance sheets "Investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures," was $14.0 million. The Company has no obligation to fund additional equity to the Rockpoint Venture. The properties held by the Rockpoint Venture are encumbered by a $233.4 million secured mortgage loan that is scheduled to mature in March 2024 and nonrecourse to the Company. The Company and its partner are in active discussions, including with the mortgage lender, as to a potential extension of the loan or other restructuring of the venture. At present, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions.

## Equity

In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Parent Company is required to, among other things, pay dividends to its shareholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. See Note 11, "Beneficiaries' Equity of the Parent Company," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our dividends declared for the third quarter of 2023.

## Inflation

## Table of Contents

Substantially all our leases are structured as base year or triple net leases which provide for reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 96% of our leases (as a percentage of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our wholly-owned portfolio) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% per lease year) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. However, recent inflation and higher interest rates has caused an increase in our borrowing costs, including on our variable rate debt.

## Other Contractual Obligations

We provide customary guarantees for certain development projects of our unconsolidated real estate ventures. See Note 15 "Commitments and Contingencies," to our Consolidated Financial Statement for further details on payment guarantees provided on behalf of our real estate ventures and refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a discussion of our contractual obligations.

## Funds from Operations (FFO)

Pursuant to the revised definition of FFO adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate FFO by adjusting net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated real estate ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated real estate ventures. Our calculation of FFO includes gains from sale of undepreciated real estate and other assets, considered incidental to our main business, to third parties or unconsolidated real estate ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the use of FFO combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REITs' operating results more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding property impairments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.

We consider net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most comparable earnings measure to FFO. While FFO and FFO per unit are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income/(loss) attributable to common unit holders and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common unitholders to FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, our ability to make distributions or payments to our shareholders. While we have not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or continued economic slowdown, defaults could increase and result in losses to us which would adversely affect our operating results and liquidity.

## Interest Rate Risk and Sensitivity Analysis

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Operating Partnership's financial instruments to selected changes in market rates. The range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen.

Our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2023, our consolidated debt consisted of (i) unsecured notes with an outstanding principal balance of $1,500.0 million, all of which are fixed rate borrowings, (ii) variable rate debt consisting of trust preferred securities with an outstanding principal balance of $78.6 million, (iii) a $600.0 million revolving credit facility with no outstanding balance, (iv) a secured fixed rate term loan with an outstanding principal balance of $245.0 million and (v) two unsecured term loans of $250.0 million and $70.0 million. The $250.0 million unsecured term loan has been swapped to a fixed rate. All financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position.

If market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would increase by approximately $8.7 million. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding secured fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately $9.1 million.

## Table of Contents

As of September 30, 2023, based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, the fair value of our unsecured notes was $1,314.2 million. For sensitivity purposes, a 100-basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of our debt of approximately $13.1 million at September 30, 2023.

From time to time or as the need arises, we use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes. The total outstanding principal balance of our variable rate debt was approximately $398.6 million as of September 30, 2023. The total fair value of our variable rate debt was approximately $355.1 million at September 30, 2023. For sensitivity purposes, if market rates of interest increase by 100 basis points the fair value of our variable rate debt would decrease by approximately $12.6 million at September 30, 2023. If market rates of interest decrease by 100 basis points the fair value of our outstanding variable rate debt would increase by approximately $13.4 million at September 30, 2023.

These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.
