SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Report") contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forwardlooking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "potential," "intend," "expect," "seek," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximately," "believe," "could," "project," "predict," "continue," "plan" or other similar words or expressions.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe future plans and strategies, contain financial and operating projections or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include the following:

* ·projections of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or other financial items;
* ·descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services;
* ·forecasts of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets; and
* ·descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing expectations regarding the timing of generating any revenues.

Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future events, actions, plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations. Some of these factors are discussed below.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report and the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 24, 2023.

* Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include, but are not limited to:
* ·changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions;
* ·our ability to comply with various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our business;
* ·changes in our investment objectives or investment or operational strategies, including any new lines of business or new products and services that may subject us to additional risks;
* ·changes in real estate values, housing prices and housing sales;
* ·the degree and nature of our competition;
* ·volatility in our industry, the debt or equity markets, the general economy or the real estate finance and real estate markets specifically, whether the result of market events or otherwise;
* ·events or circumstances which undermine confidence in the financial and housing markets or otherwise have a broad impact on financial and housing markets, such as the sudden instability or collapse of large depository institutions or other significant corporations, terrorist attacks, natural or man-made disasters, or threatened or actual armed conflicts;
* ·changes in general business, economic, market, employment and domestic and international political conditions, or in consumer confidence and spending habits from those expected;
* ·the availability of, and level of competition for, attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities in loans and mortgage-related assets that satisfy our investment objectives;
* ·the inherent difficulty in winning bids to acquire loans, and our success in doing so;
* ·the concentration of credit risks to which we are exposed;
* ·our dependence on our Manager and servicer, potential conflicts of interest with such entities and their affiliates, and the performance of such entities;
* ·changes in personnel and lack of availability of qualified personnel at our Manager, servicer or their affiliates;
* ·the availability, terms and deployment of short-term and long-term capital;
* ·the adequacy of our cash reserves and working capital;

·our substantial amount of debt;

·our ability to maintain the desired relationship between our financing and the interest rates and maturities of our assets;

·the timing and amount of cash flows, if any, from our investments;

·our exposure to risks of loss and disruptions in operations resulting from adverse weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, climate change and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic;

* ·unanticipated increases or volatility in financing and other costs, including a rise in interest rates;

·the performance, financial condition and liquidity of borrowers;

·the ability of our servicer, which also provides us with fulfillment services, to approve and monitor correspondent sellers and underwrite loans to investor standards;

·incomplete or inaccurate information or documentation provided by customers or counterparties, or adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers and counterparties;

·our indemnification and repurchase obligations in connection with loans we purchase and later sell or securitize;

·the quality and enforceability of the collateral documentation evidencing our ownership and rights in the assets in which we invest;

* ·increased rates of delinquency, default and/or decreased recovery rates on our investments;
* ·the performance of loans underlying mortgage-backed securities in which we retain credit risk;

·our ability to foreclose on our investments in a timely manner or at all;

·the degree to which our hedging strategies may or may not protect us from interest rate volatility;

·the effect of the accuracy of or changes in the estimates we make about uncertainties, contingencies and asset and liability valuations when measuring and reporting upon our financial condition and results of operations;

·our ability to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;

·technology failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and our ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions;

·our ability to obtain and/or maintain licenses and other approvals in those jurisdictions where required to conduct our business;

·our ability to detect misconduct and fraud;

* ·changes in our CRT arrangements and agreements;
* ·developments in the secondary markets for our loan products;
* ·legislative and regulatory changes that impact the loan industry or housing market;

·changes in regulations that impact the business, operations or governance of mortgage lenders and/or publicly-traded companies or such changes that increase the cost of doing business with such entities;

·the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its issued and future rules and the enforcement thereof;

·changes in government support of homeownership;

* ·our ability to effectively identify, manage and hedge our credit, interest rate, prepayment, liquidity and climate risks;
* ·changes in government or government-sponsored home affordability programs;
* ·limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes and qualify for an exclusion from the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to qualify as REITs or as taxable REIT subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules;

·changes in governmental regulations, accounting treatment, tax rates and similar matters (including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs, or the exclusions from registration as an investment company);

* ·our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in the future;
* ·our failure to deal appropriately with issues that may give rise to reputational risk; and
* ·our organizational structure and certain requirements in our charter documents.

Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in this Report or any other document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
------------------------------------------------------

Note 1-Organization
-------------------

PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust ("PMT" or the "Company") is a specialty finance company, which, through its subsidiaries (all of which are whollyowned), invests in residential mortgage-related assets. The Company operates in four segments: credit sensitive strategies, interest rate sensitive strategies, correspondent production, and corporate:

* ·The credit sensitive strategies segment represents the Company's investments in credit risk transfer ("CRT") arrangements referencing loans from its own correspondent production, including CRT agreements ("CRT Agreements") and other CRT securities (together, "CRT arrangements") and subordinate mortgagebacked securities ("MBS").
* ·The interest rate sensitive strategies segment represents the Company's investments in mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), Agency and senior non-Agency MBS and the related interest rate hedging activities.
* ·The correspondent production segment represents the Company's operations aimed at serving as an intermediary between lenders and the capital markets by purchasing, pooling and reselling newly originated prime credit quality loans either directly or in the form of MBS, using the services of PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ("PCM") and PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ("PLS"), both indirect controlled subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ("PFSI"), a publicly-traded mortgage banking and investment management company separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
* The Company primarily sells the loans it acquires through its correspondent production activities to government-sponsored entities ("GSEs") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or to PLS for sale into securitizations guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") or the GSEs. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are each referred to as an "Agency" and, collectively, as the "Agencies."
* ·The corporate segment includes management fees, corporate expense amounts and certain interest income and expense.

The Company conducts substantially all of its operations and makes substantially all of its investments through its subsidiary, PennyMac Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the sole general partner, and the Company is the sole limited partner, of the Operating Partnership.

The Company believes that it qualifies, and has elected to be taxed, as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain its tax status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income in the form of qualifying distributions to shareholders.

Note 2-Basis of Presentation
----------------------------

The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification for interim financial information and with the Securities and Exchange Commission's instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements and notes do not include all of the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. This interim consolidated information should be read together with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be anticipated for the full year. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results will likely differ from those estimates.

The Company held no restricted cash during the periods presented. Therefore, the consolidated statements of cash flows do not include references to restricted cash.

Note 3-Concentration of Risks
-----------------------------

As discussed in Note 1 Organization above, PMT's operations and investing activities are centered in residential mortgage-related assets, including CRT arrangements, subordinate MBS, Agency and senior Non-Agency MBS and MSRs. CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS are more sensitive to borrower credit performance than other mortgage-related investments such as traditional

loans and Agency MBS. Fixed-rate Agency and senior non-Agency MBS are sensitive to changes in market interest rates. MSRs are sensitive to changes in prepayment rate activity and expectations.

Credit Risk
-----------

Note 6 -Variable Interest Entities details the Company's investments in CRT arrangements whereby the Company sold pools of loans into Fannie Mae guaranteed loan securitizations which became reference pools underlying the CRT arrangements. Fannie Mae transferred interest-only ("IO") ownership interests and recourse obligations based upon securitized reference pools of loans subject to the CRT arrangements into trust entities, and the Company acquired the IO ownership interest and assumed the recourse obligations in the CRT arrangements.

The Company also invests in subordinate MBS, which are among the first beneficial interests in the issuing trusts to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans.

The Company's retention of credit risk through its investment in CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS subjects it to risks associated with delinquency and foreclosure similar to the risks of loss associated with owning the underlying loans, which is greater than the risk of loss associated with selling such loans to the Agencies without the retention of such credit risk in the case of CRT arrangements and investing in senior mortgage pass through securities in the case of subordinate MBS.

CRT Agreements are structured such that loans that reach a specific number of days delinquent trigger losses chargeable to the CRT Agreements based on the size of the loan and a contractual schedule of loss severity. Therefore, the risks associated with delinquency and foreclosure may in some instances, be greater than the risks associated with owning the related loans because the structure of the CRT Agreements provides that the Company may be required to absorb losses in the event of delinquency or foreclosure even when there is ultimately no loss realized with respect to such loans (e.g., as a result of a borrower's re-performance). In contrast, the structure of the Company's investment in CRT strips requires PMT to absorb losses only when the reference loans realize losses.

Fair Value Risk
---------------

The Company is exposed to fair value risk in addition to the risks specific to credit and, as a result of prevailing market conditions, may be required to recognize losses associated with adverse changes to the fair value of its investments in MSRs, CRT arrangements, and MBS:

* ·The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in prepayment speeds, estimates of cost to service the underlying loans or the returns demanded by market participants;
* ·The fair values of CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS are sensitive to market perceptions of future credit performance of the underlying loans as well as the actual credit performance of such loans and to the returns required by market participants to hold such investments; and
* ·The fair values of fixed-rate Agency and senior non-Agency pass through MBS are sensitive to changes in market interest rates.

Note 4-Transactions with Related Parties
----------------------------------------

The Company enters into transactions with subsidiaries of PFSI in support of its operating, investing and financing activities as summarized below.

Operating Activities
--------------------

Loan Servicing
--------------

The Company has a loan servicing agreement with PLS (the "Servicing Agreement") pursuant to which PLS provides subservicing for the Company's portfolio of MSRs, loans held for sale, loans held in VIEs (prime servicing) and its portfolio of residential loans purchased with credit deterioration (special servicing). The Servicing Agreement provides for servicing fees earned by PLS that are established at a per loan monthly amount based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure status of the serviced loan or real estate acquired in settlement of loans ("REO"). The Servicing Agreement expires on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms.

Prime Servicing
---------------

The base servicing fees for prime loans subserviced by PLS on the Company's behalf are $7.50 per month for fixed-rate loans and $8.50 per month for adjustable-rate loans.

To the extent that these prime loans become delinquent, PLS is entitled to an additional servicing fee per loan ranging from $10 to $55 per month and based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and foreclosure status of the loan or $75 per month if the underlying mortgaged property becomes REO.

PLS is also entitled to customary ancillary income and certain market-based fees and charges, including boarding and deboarding fees, liquidation and disposition fees, assumption, modification and origination fees and certain fees for pandemic-related forbearance and modification activities.

Special Servicing
-----------------

The base servicing fee rates for loans purchased with credit deterioration (distressed loans) range from $30 per month for current loans up to $95 per month for loans in foreclosure proceedings. The base servicing fee rate for REO is $75 per month. PLS also receives a supplemental servicing fee of $25 per month for each distressed loan.

PLS receives activity-based fees for modifications, foreclosures and liquidations that it facilitates with respect to distressed loans, as well as other market-based refinancing and loan disposition fees.

MSR Recapture Agreement
-----------------------

The Company has an MSR recapture agreement with PFSI. Pursuant to the terms of the MSR recapture agreement, if PFSI refinances (recaptures) mortgage loans for which the Company previously held the MSRs, PFSI is generally required to transfer and convey to the Company cash in an amount equal to:

* ·40% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the first 15% of the "recapture rate";
* ·35% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the "recapture rate" in excess of 15% and up to 30%; and
* ·30% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the "recapture rate" in excess of 30%.

The "recapture rate" means, during each month, the ratio of (i) the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all recaptured loans, to (ii) the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all mortgage loans for which the Company held the MSRs and that were refinanced or otherwise paid off in such month. PFSI has further agreed to allocate sufficient resources to target a recapture rate of at least 15%.

The MSR recapture agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18month periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms.

Following is a summary of loan servicing fees earned by PLS:

Correspondent Production Activities
-----------------------------------

The Company is provided fulfillment and other services by PLS under an amended and restated mortgage banking services agreement. The Company does not hold the Ginnie Mae approval required to issue securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae MBS and act as a servicer. Accordingly, under the agreement, PLS currently purchases loans saleable in accordance with the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide "as is" and without recourse of any kind from the Company at cost less any administrative fees paid by the correspondent to the

Company plus accrued interest and a sourcing fee. The Company may also sell conventional loans to PLS under the same arrangement subject to mutual agreement between the parties.

Fulfillment and sourcing fees are summarized below:

* ·Fulfillment fees shall not exceed the following:
* (i)the number of loan commitments issued by the Company multiplied by a pull-through factor of either .99 or .80 depending on whether the loan commitments are subject to a "mandatory trade confirmation" or a "best efforts lock confirmation", respectively, and then multiplied by $585 for each pullthrough adjusted loan commitment up to and including 16,500 per quarter and $355 for each pull-through adjusted loan commitment in excess of 16,500 per quarter, plus
* (ii)$315 multiplied by the number of purchased loans up to and including 16,500 per quarter and $195 multiplied by the number of purchased loans in excess of 16,500 per quarter, plus
* (iii)$750 multiplied by the number of all purchased loans that are sold or securitized to parties other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; provided however, that no fulfillment fee shall be due or payable to PLS with respect to any Ginnie Mae loans or, as of October 1, 2022, designated Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans acquired by PLS.

·Sourcing fees range from one to two basis points of the loans' unpaid principal balance ("UPB"), generally based on the average number of calendar days the loans are held by PMT before purchase by PLS.

The mortgage banking services agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms.

The Company may purchase newly originated conforming balance non-government insured or guaranteed loans from PLS under a mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement.

Management Fees
---------------

The Company has a management agreement with PCM pursuant to which PMT pays PCM management fees as follows:

The performance incentive fee is equal to the sum of: (a) 10% of the amount by which "net income" for the quarter exceeds (i) an 8% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark", up to (ii) a 12% return on "equity"; plus (b) 15% of the amount by which "net

income" for the quarter exceeds (i) a 12% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark", up to (ii) a 16% return on "equity"; plus (c) 20% of the amount by which "net income" for the quarter exceeds a 16% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark."

For the purpose of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee:

"Net income" is defined as net income or loss attributable to the Company's common shares of beneficial interest ("Common Shares") calculated in accordance with GAAP, and adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussion between PCM and the Company's independent trustees and after approval by a majority of the Company's independent trustees.

"Equity" is the weighted average of the issue price per Common Share of all of the Company's public offerings, multiplied by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding (including restricted share units) in the rolling four-quarter period.

"High watermark" is the quarterly adjustment that reflects the amount by which the "net income" (stated as a percentage of return on "equity") in that quarter exceeds or falls short of the lesser of 8% and the average Fannie Mae 30-year MBS yield (the "Target Yield") for the four quarters then ended. The "high watermark" starts at zero and is adjusted quarterly. If the "net income" is lower than the Target Yield, the "high watermark" is increased by the difference. If the "net income" is higher than the Target Yield, the "high watermark" is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the "high watermark" returns to zero. As a result, the threshold amounts required for PCM to earn a performance incentive fee are adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT's "net income" over (or under) the Target Yield, until the "net income" in excess of the Target Yield exceeds the then-current cumulative "high watermark" amount.

The base management fee and the performance incentive fee are both payable quarterly in arrears. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or a combination of cash and the Company's Common Shares (subject to a limit of no more than 50% paid in Common Shares), at the Company's option.

In the event of termination of the management agreement between the Company and PCM, PCM may be entitled to a termination fee in certain circumstances. The termination fee is equal to three times the sum of (a) the average annual base management fee, and (b) the average annual performance incentive fee earned by PCM, in each case during the 24-month period before termination of the management agreement.

Expense Reimbursement
---------------------

Under the management agreement, PCM is entitled to reimbursement of its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on the Company's behalf, it being understood that PCM and its affiliates shall allocate a portion of their personnel's time to provide certain legal, tax and investor relations services for the direct benefit of the Company. PCM is reimbursed $165,000 per fiscal quarter, such amount to be reviewed annually and to not preclude reimbursement for any other services performed by PCM or its affiliates.

The Company is required to pay PCM and its affiliates a portion of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of PCM and its affiliates required for the Company's and its subsidiaries' operations. These expenses are allocated based on the ratio of the Company's and its subsidiaries' proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed or owned by PCM and/or its affiliates as calculated at each fiscal quarter end.

Note 6-Variable Interest Entities
---------------------------------

The Company is a variable interest holder in various VIEs that relate to its investing and financing activities.

Credit Risk Transfer Arrangements
---------------------------------

The Company has previously entered into certain loan sales arrangements pursuant to which it accepted credit risk relating to the loans sold in exchange for a portion of the interest earned on such loans. These arrangements absorb scheduled or realized credit losses on such loans and include CRT Agreements and other CRT securities.

The Company, through its subsidiary, PennyMac Corp. ("PMC"), entered into CRT arrangements with Fannie Mae, pursuant to which the Company sold pools of loans into Fannie Mae-guaranteed securitizations while retaining recourse obligations as part of the retention of IO ownership interests in such loans and include:

·CRT Agreements, which are structured such that loans that reach a specific number of days delinquent (including loans in forbearance) trigger losses chargeable to the CRT Agreements based on the size of the loan and a contractual schedule of loss severity; and

* ·Other CRT securities, which require the Company to absorb losses only when the reference loans realize credit losses.

The Company placed Deposits securing CRT arrangements into the subsidiary trust entities to secure its recourse obligations. The Deposits securing CRT arrangements represent the Company's maximum contractual exposure to claims under its recourse obligations and are the sole source of settlement of losses under the CRT arrangements.

The Company's exposure to losses under its recourse obligations was initially established at rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.0% of the UPB of the loans sold under the CRT arrangements. As the UPB of the underlying loans subject to each CRT arrangement is reduced through repayments, the percentage exposure of each CRT arrangement will increase to maximums ranging from 4.5% to 5.0% of outstanding UPB, although the total dollar amount of exposure to losses does not increase.

The Company has concluded that the subsidiary trust entities holding its CRT arrangements are VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it is the holder of the primary beneficial interests, which absorb the variability of the trusts' results of operations. For CRT Agreements, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as CRT Derivatives in Derivative assets and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. For other CRT securities, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations as CRT strips which are also included on the consolidated balance sheet in Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. Gains and losses on the derivatives and strips (including the IO ownership interest sold to nonaffiliates) included in the CRT arrangements are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of operations.

Following is a summary of the CRT arrangements:

Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities
--------------------------------------

The Company retains or purchases subordinate MBS in transactions sponsored by PMC or a nonaffiliate. Cash inflows from the loans underlying these securities are distributed to investors and service providers in accordance with the respective securities' contractual priority of payments and, as such, most of these inflows must be directed first to service and repay the senior securities.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

The rights of holders of subordinate securities to receive distributions of principal and/or interest, as applicable, are subordinate to the rights of holders of senior securities. After senior securities are repaid, substantially all cash inflows will be directed to subordinate securities, including those held by the Company, until they are fully repaid.

The Company's retention or purchase of subordinate MBS exposes PMT to the credit risk in the underlying loans because the Company's investments are among the first beneficial interests to absorb credit losses on those assets. The Company's exposure to losses from its investments in subordinate MBS is limited to its recorded investment in such securities.

Whether the Company concludes that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs issuing the subordinate MBS and therefore consolidates these entities is based on its exposure to losses that could be significant to the VIEs and its power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance:

* ·Certain of the Company's investments in subordinate MBS either do not expose the Company to losses or residual returns that could be significant to the issuing VIE or the Company has concluded that it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. These investments are classified as subordinate credit-linked securities in its investment in MBS as shown in Note 8 Mortgage-Backed Securities .
* ·For other investments in subordinate MBS, comprised of transactions backed by loans purchased by the Company that were subsequently included in securitizations sponsored by the Company or a nonaffiliate and serviced by PLS, the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it has the power, through PLS, in its role as the servicer or sub-servicer of the majority of the loans, to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and, as a holder of subordinate securities, is exposed to losses or residual returns that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Therefore, PMT consolidates the VIEs that issue those subordinate MBS.

The Company recognizes the interest income earned on the loans owned by the VIEs and the interest expense attributable to the asset-backed securities issued to nonaffiliates by its consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of operations.

Following is a summary of the Company's investment in subordinate mortgage-backed securities held in consolidated VIEs:

Note 7- Fair Value
------------------

The Company's consolidated financial statements include assets and liabilities that are measured at or based on their fair values. Measurement at or based on fair value may be on a recurring or nonrecurring basis depending on the accounting principles applicable to the specific asset or liability and whether the Company has elected to carry the item at its fair value as discussed in the following paragraphs.

The Company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are:

* ·Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
* ·Level 2-Prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.

·Level 3-Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where significant observable inputs are unavailable, unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, and are based on the best information available in the circumstances.

As a result of the difficulty in observing certain significant valuation inputs affecting "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, the Company is required to make judgments regarding these items' fair values. Different persons in possession of the same facts may reasonably arrive at different conclusions as to the inputs to be applied in valuing these assets and liabilities and their fair values. Such differences may result in significantly different fair value measurements. Likewise, due to the general illiquidity of some of these assets and liabilities, subsequent transactions may be at values significantly different from those reported.

The Company reclassifies its assets and liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy when the inputs required to establish fair value at a level of the fair value hierarchy are no longer readily available, requiring the use of lower-level inputs, or when the inputs required to establish fair value at a higher level of the hierarchy become available.

Fair Value Accounting Elections
-------------------------------

The Company identified all of PMT's non-cash financial assets and MSRs to be accounted for at fair value. The Company has elected to account for these assets at fair value so such changes in fair value will be reflected in income as they occur and more timely reflect the results of the Company's performance.

The Company identified PMT's asset-backed financings of VIEs and interest only security payable to be accounted for at fair value to reflect the generally offsetting changes in fair value of these borrowings to changes in fair value of the assets at fair value collateralizing these financings. For other borrowings, the Company has determined that historical cost accounting is more appropriate because under this method debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the debt facilities, thereby matching the debt issuance cost to the periods benefiting from the availability of these facilities.

Following is a summary of the carrying value of assets that were remeasured during the period based on fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

| Real estate acquired in settlement of loans | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |

| December 31, 2022 | $ - | $ - | $ 1,292 | $ 1,292 |

The following table summarizes the fair value changes recognized during the periods on assets held at period end that were remeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Real estate asset acquired in settlement of loans | $ | (119 | (288 ) | (199 ) |

The Company remeasures its REO based on fair value when it evaluates the REO for impairment. The Company evaluates its REO for impairment with reference to the respective properties' fair values less costs to sell. REO may be revalued after acquisition due to the Company receiving greater access to the property, the property being held for an extended period or receiving indications that the property's fair value may not be supported by developing market conditions. Any subsequent change in fair value to a level that is less than or equal to the property's cost is recognized in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Amortized Cost
-------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the Company's borrowings are carried at amortized cost. The Company's Assets sold under agreements to repurchase , Mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements, Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and the Exchangeable Notes defined in Note 15 are classified as "Level 3" fair value liabilities due to the Company's reliance on unobservable inputs to estimate these instruments' fair values. The Company classifies the 2023 Senior Notes, defined in Note 15, as "Level 2" fair value liabilities.

The Company has concluded that the fair values of these borrowings other than term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and Unsecured senior notes approximate the agreements' carrying values due to the borrowing agreements' variable interest rates and short maturities.

The Company estimates the fair value of the term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets indications of fair value provided by nonaffiliate brokers for the term notes and pricing services for Unsecured senior notes and internal estimates of fair value for the term loans. The fair value and carrying value of these liabilities are summarized below:

| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instrument | Carrying value | Fair value | Carrying value | Fair value |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets | $ 2,825,591 | $ 2,804,737 | $ 2,804,028 | $ 2,721,391 |
| Unsecured senior notes | $ 599,754 | $ 567,189 | $ 546,254 | $ 471,781 |

Most of the Company's assets, its Asset-backed financings at fair value, Interest-only security payable at fair value and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities at fair value are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period results of operations. A substantial portion of these items are "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities which require the use of unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability and are based on the best information available under the circumstances.

Due to the difficulty in estimating the fair values of "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, the Company has assigned responsibility for estimating the fair value of these assets and liabilities to specialized staff within its capital markets group and subjects the valuation process to significant senior management oversight.

With respect to "Level 3" valuations other than IRLCs, the capital markets valuation staff reports to PFSI's senior management valuation committee, which oversees the valuations. The capital markets valuation staff monitors the models used for valuation of the Company's "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities other than IRLCs, including the models' performance versus actual results, and

reports those results to PFSI's senior management valuation committee. PFSI's senior management valuation committee includes the Company's chief financial, risk, credit, and capital markets officers as well as other senior members of the Company's finance, capital markets and risk management staffs.

The capital markets valuation staff is responsible for reporting to PFSI's senior management valuation committee on the changes in the valuation of the nonIRLC "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, including major factors affecting the valuation and any changes in model methods and inputs. To assess the reasonableness of its valuations, the capital markets valuation staff presents an analysis of the effect on the valuation of changes to the significant inputs to the models and, for MSRs, comparisons of its estimates of fair value and key inputs to those procured from nonaffiliate brokers and published surveys.

The fair value of the Company's IRLCs is developed by its capital markets risk management staff and is reviewed by capital markets operations staff.

Valuation Techniques and Inputs
-------------------------------

The following is a description of the techniques and inputs used in estimating the fair values of "Level 2" and "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities:

Mortgage-Backed Securities
--------------------------

* The Company's categorization of its current holdings of MBS is based on whether the respective security is a pass-through security or an IO security:
* ·The Company categorizes the majority of its current holdings of MBS as "Level 2" fair value assets. Fair value of these securities is established based on quoted market prices for the Company's MBS holdings or similar securities.
* ·The Company categorizes its current holdings of interest-only stripped ("IO") securities as "Level 3" fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of its IO securities.

The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of IO securities include discount rate (pricing spread) and prepayment rate (prepayment speed). Significant changes to those inputs in isolation may result in a significant change in the IO securities fair value measurement. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related.

Following are the key inputs used in determining the fair value of IO securities:

| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fair value (in thousands) | $ | 103,533 |
| UPB of securities (in thousands) | $ | 425,682 |
| Weighted average interest rate | 4.9% | |
| Key inputs (1) | | |
| Pricing spread (2) | | |
| Range | 5.6% - 5.6% | |
| Weighted average | 5.6% | |
| Annual total prepayment speed (3) | | |
| Range | 8.1% - 8.2% | |
| Weighted average | 8.1% | |
| Equivalent life (in years) | | |
| Range | 5.4 - 8.8 | |
| Weighted average | 8.7 | |

Changes in the fair value of MBS are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of operations.

Loans
-----

Fair value of loans is estimated based on whether the loans are saleable into active markets:

·Loans that are saleable into active markets, comprised of most of the Company's loans acquired for sale at fair value and all of the loans at fair value held in VIEs, are categorized as "Level 2" fair value assets:

* ·For loans acquired for sale, the fair values are established using the loans' contracted selling price or quoted market price or market price equivalent.
* ·For the loans at fair value held in VIEs, the quoted indications of fair value of all of the individual securities issued by the securitization trusts are used to derive fair values for the loans. The Company obtains indications of fair value from nonaffiliate brokers based on comparable securities and validates the brokers' indications of fair value using pricing models and inputs the Company believes are similar to the pricing models and inputs used by other market participants. The Company adjusts the fair values received from brokers to include the fair value of MSRs attributable to the loans included in the VIEs.
* ·Loans that are not saleable into active markets, comprised of previously sold loans that the Company repurchased pursuant to the representation and warranties it provided to the purchaser and distressed loans, are categorized as "Level 3" fair value assets:
* ·Fair value for loans acquired for sale categorized as "Level 3" assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach or their contracted selling price when applicable. Inputs to the discounted cash flow model include current interest rates, payment status, property types, discount rates and forecasts of future interest rates, home prices, prepayment speeds, default speeds and loss severities.
* ·Distressed loans' fair values are estimated based on the expected resolution from the individual asset's disposition strategy. When a cash flow projection is used to estimate the fair value, those cash flows are discounted at annual rates up to 20%.

Derivative and Credit Risk Transfer Strip Assets and Liabilities
----------------------------------------------------------------

CRT Derivatives
---------------

The Company categorizes CRT derivatives as "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities. The fair value of CRT derivatives is based on indications of fair value provided to the Company by nonaffiliate brokers for the certificates representing the beneficial interests in the trusts holding the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors , the recourse obligations and the IO ownership interests. Together, the recourse obligation and the IO ownership interest comprise the CRT derivative. Fair value of the CRT derivatives is derived by deducting the balance of the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors from the fair value of the certificates.

The Company assesses the fair values it receives from nonaffiliate brokers using the discounted cash flow approach. The significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in its review and approval of the valuation of CRT derivatives are the discount rates, voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds and the remaining loss expectations of the reference loans. Changes in fair value of CRT derivatives are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of operations.

Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the Company's review and approval of broker-provided fair values for CRT derivatives:

| | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) |
| Fair value | | |
| CRT derivatives | | |
| Assets | $ 7,010 | $ 1,262 |
| Liabilities | $ 2,268 | $ 23,360 |
| UPB of loans in reference pools | $ 5,556,206 | $ 5,972,060 |
| Key inputs (1) | | |
| Discount rate | | |
| Range | 10.1% - 11.4% | 8.7% - 11.1% |
| Weighted average | 11.0% | 10.8% |
| Voluntary prepayment speed (2) | | |
| Range | 6.7% - 7.4% | 7.5% - 8.3% |
| Weighted average | 7.3% | 7.6% |
| Involuntary prepayment speed (3) | | |
| Range | 0.2% - 0.8% | 0.5% - 1.3% |
| Weighted average | 0.4% | 0.6% |
| Remaining loss expectation | | |
| Range | 0.3% - 0.4% | 0.4% - 0.7% |
| Weighted average | 0.3% | 0.6% |

Interest Rate Lock Commitments
------------------------------

The Company categorizes IRLCs as "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities. The Company estimates the fair value of IRLCs based on quoted Agency MBS prices, the probability that the loans will be purchased under the commitments (the "pull-through rate") and the Company's estimate of the fair value of the MSRs it expects to receive upon sale of the loans.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's IRLCs are the pull-through rates and the estimated MSRs attributed to the mortgage loans subject to the commitments. Significant changes in the pull-through rate or the MSR component of the IRLCs, in isolation, may result in a significant change in the IRLCs' fair value. The financial effects of changes in these inputs are generally inversely correlated as increasing interest rates have a positive effect on the fair value of the MSR component of an IRLC's fair value, but also increase the pull-through rate for the loan principal and interest payment cash flow component that has decreased in fair value. Changes in fair value of IRLCs are included in Net gains on loans acquired for sale in the consolidated statements of operations.

Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of IRLCs:

| | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fair value (in thousands) (1) | $ (3,348 | $ (478 |
| Committed amount (in thousands) | $ 1,459,919 | $ 1,484,384 |
| Key inputs (2) | | |
| Pull-through rate | | |
| Range | 62.6% - 100% | 54.8% - 100% |
| Weighted average | 85.4% | 92.1% |
| MSR fair value expressed as | | |
| Servicing fee multiple | | |
| Range | 3.6 - 7.0 | 1.9 - 7.1 |
| Weighted average | 5.3 | 4.7 |
| Percentage of UPB | | |
| Range | 0.9% - 2.8% | 0.7% - 3.1% |
| Weighted average | 1.9% | 1.9% |

Hedging Derivatives
-------------------

Fair value of derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges are categorized by the Company as "Level 1" fair value assets and liabilities. Fair values of derivative financial instruments based on observable interest rates, volatilities and prices in the MBS or other markets are categorized by the Company as "Level 2" fair value assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of hedging derivatives are included in Net loan servicing fees - from nonaffiliates - Mortgage servicing rights hedging results, Net gains on loans acquired for sale or Net (losses) gains on investments and financings, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations.

Credit Risk Transfer Strips
---------------------------

The Company categorizes CRT strips as "Level 3" fair value assets or liabilities. The fair value of CRT strips is based on indications of fair value provided to the Company by nonaffiliate brokers for the securities representing the beneficial interests in the trusts holding the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors, the IO ownership interest and recourse obligation. Together, the IO ownership interest and the recourse obligation comprise the CRT strip.

Fair value of the CRT strips is derived by deducting the balance of the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors from the fair value of the securities derived from indications provided by the nonaffiliate brokers. Through December 31, 2021, the Company applied adjustments to the fair value derived from these indications to account for contractual restrictions limiting PMT's ability to sell certain of the certificates. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the contractual restrictions on the Company's ability to sell the certificates were removed. The Company recognized the effect of the removal of this restriction in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings during the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

The Company assesses the indications of fair value it receives from nonaffiliate brokers using the discounted cash flow approach. The significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in its review and approval of the valuation of the CRT strips are the discount rate, voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds and the remaining loss expectations of the reference loans. Changes in fair value of CRT strips are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of operations .

Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the Company's review and approval of the broker-provided fair values used to derive the fair value of the CRT strip liabilities:

| | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) |
| Fair value | 68,592 | 137,193 |
| UPB of loans in the reference pools | 18,057,469 | 19,343,464 |
| Key inputs (1) | | |
| Discount rate | | |
| Range | 8.7% - 11.0% | 4.3% - 11.3% |
| Weighted average | 10.7% | 10.5% |
| Voluntary prepayment speed (2) | | |
| Range | 6.5% - 7.8% | 7.7% - 7.9% |
| Weighted average | 6.7% | 7.7% |
| Involuntary prepayment speed (3) | | |
| Range | 0.2% - 0.4% | 0.6% - 2.0% |
| Weighted average | 0.2% | 0.8% |
| Remaining loss expectation | | |
| Range | 0.5% - 1.7% | 0.7% - 2.0% |
| Weighted average | 0.7% | 0.9% |

Mortgage Servicing Rights
-------------------------

The Company categorizes MSRs as "Level 3" fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs. The fair value of MSRs is derived from the net positive cash flows associated with the servicing agreements. The Company receives a servicing fee based on the remaining UPB of the loans subject to the servicing agreements and generally has the right to receive other remuneration including various mortgagor-contracted fees such as late charges and collateral reconveyance charges, and is generally entitled to retain any placement fees earned on certain custodial funds held pending remittance of mortgagor principal, interest, tax and insurance payments.

The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include the applicable pricing spreads, the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, and the annual per-loan cost to service the loans, all of which are unobservable. Significant changes to any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the MSR fair value measurement. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are included in Net loan servicing fees - From nonaffiliates - Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights in the consolidated statements of operations.

MSRs are generally subject to loss in fair value when mortgage interest rates decrease, when returns required by market participants (pricing spreads) increase, or when annual per-loan cost of servicing increases. Reductions in the fair value of MSRs affect income primarily through recognition of the change in fair value.

Following are the key inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs at the time of initial recognition:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Real Estate Acquired in Settlement of Loans
-------------------------------------------

REO is measured based on its fair value on a nonrecurring basis and is categorized as a "Level 3" fair value asset. Fair value of REO is established by using a current estimate of fair value from either a broker's price opinion, a full appraisal, or the price given in a pending contract of sale.

REO fair values are reviewed by PLS staff appraisers when the Company obtains multiple indications of fair value and there is a significant difference between the indications of fair value. PLS staff appraisers will attempt to resolve the difference between the indications of fair value. In circumstances where the staff appraisers are not able to generate adequate data to support a fair value conclusion, the staff appraisers obtain an additional appraisal to determine fair value. Recognized changes in the fair value of REO are included in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the consolidated statements of operations.

* ·IRLCs that are created when the Company commits to purchase loans acquired for sale; and
* ·CRT Agreements whereby the Company retained a recourse obligation relating to certain loans it sold into Fannie Mae guaranteed securitizations as part of the retention of IO ownership interests in such loans.

The Company engages in interest rate risk management activities in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities. The Company bears price risk related to its mortgage production, servicing assets and MBS financing activities due to changes in market interest rates as discussed below:

* ·The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates increase, because market interest rate increases generally cause the fair value of MBS, IRLCs and loans acquired for sale to decrease.
* ·The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates decrease, because market interest rate decreases generally cause the fair value of MSRs to decrease.

To manage the price risk resulting from these interest rate risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments with the intention of moderating the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the fair value of the Company's MBS, inventory of loans acquired for sale, IRLCs and MSRs. The Company does not designate and qualify any of its derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting.

Cash flows from derivative financial instruments relating to hedging of IRLCs and loans acquired for sale are included in Cash flows from operating activities in Sale to nonaffiliates and repayment of loans acquired for sale at fair value. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments relating to hedging of MSRs are included in Cash flows from investing activities .

Mortgage Loan Participation Purchase and Sale Agreement
-------------------------------------------------------

One of the borrowing facilities secured by loans acquired for sale is in the form of a mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreement. Participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a pool of loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, are sold to the lender pending the securitization of such loans and the sale of the resulting security. The commitment between the Company and a nonaffiliate to sell such security is also assigned to the lender at the time a participation certificate is sold.

The purchase price paid by the lender for each participation certificate is based on the trade price of the security, plus an amount of interest expected to accrue on the security to its anticipated delivery date, minus a present value adjustment, any related hedging costs and a holdback amount. The holdback amount is based on a percentage of the purchase price and is not required to be paid to the Company until the settlement of the security and its delivery to the lender.

The mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreement is summarized below:

Fannie Mae MSR Financing
------------------------

The Company, through a subsidiary, PMT ISSUER TRUST-FMSR, finances MSRs and ESS pledged or sold by PMC through a combination of repurchase agreements and term financing.

The repurchase agreement financing for Fannie Mae MSRs is effected through the issuance of a Series 2017-VF1 Note dated December 20, 2017 (the "FMSR VFN") by PMT ISSUER TRUST-FMSR to PMC which is then sold to qualified institutional buyers under an agreement to repurchase. The amount outstanding under the FMSR VFN is included in Assets sold under agreements to repurchase in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The FMSR VFN has a committed borrowing capacity of $1 billion and matures on June 27, 2025.

The Company's term financing for Fannie Mae MSRs through PMT ISSUER TRUST - FMSR is effected through the issuance of term notes (the "FT-1 Term Notes") to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and a series of syndicated term loans with various lenders (the "FT-1 Term Loans").

On May 25, 2023, the Company, through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, PMT ISSUER TRUST - FMSR and PMC, entered into a syndicated series of term notes for $155 million (the "Series 2023-FTL1 Loan"), as part of the structured finance transaction that PMC uses to finance Fannie Mae MSRs and related excess servicing spread. On August 16, 2023, two additional lenders were added to the Series 2023-FTL1 Loan and the overall note balance increased by $215 million to $370 million. The initial

five-year term of the Series 2023-FTL1 Loan is set to expire on May 25, 2028, unless the Company exercises a one-year optional extension. The Series 2023-FTL1 Loan ranks pari passu with the Series 2021-FT1 and Series 2022-FT1 term notes, and the Amended and Restated Series 2017-VF1 Master Repurchase Agreement dated June 29, 2018.

--------------------------------

In March 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30, 2023, the USD LIBOR for a three-month tenor would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR, in March 2022, the U.S. Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, and, in December 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a final rule thereunder (the "LIBOR Rule"). The LIBOR Rule provides that, with respect to any reference in the terms of a security requiring a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR ("Polling Provisions") contained in so called "fallback provisions" applicable in the event USD LIBOR is not published, such Polling Provisions shall be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect.

In accordance with the Articles Supplementary for each of the Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series A Preferred Shares") and the Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), and disregarding the Polling Provisions contained therein, the applicable dividend rate for dividend periods from and after March 15, 2024, in the case of the Series A

Preferred Shares, or June 15, 2024, in the case of the Series B Preferred Shares, will be calculated at the dividend rate in effect for the immediately preceding dividend period. As a result, the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares will continue to accumulate dividends from and after March 15, 2024, in the case of the Series A Preferred Shares, or June 15, 2024, in the case of the Series B Preferred Shares, at their annual fixed rate and will not transition to floating reference rates.

The Series A Preferred Shares, the Series B Preferred Shares and Series C Preferred Shares will not be redeemable before March 15, 2024, June 15, 2024 and August 24, 2026, respectively, except in connection with the Company's qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or upon the occurrence of a change of control. On or after the date the Preferred Shares become redeemable, or 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurs, the Company may, at its option, redeem any or all of the Preferred Shares at $25.00 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date.

The Preferred Shares have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted into Common Shares in connection with a change of control by the holders of the Preferred Shares.

Common Shares of Beneficial Interest

Note 22-Share-Based Compensation
--------------------------------

The Company has adopted an equity incentive plan ("2019 Plan") which provides for the issuance of equity based awards based on PMT's Common Shares that may be made by the Company to its officers and trustees, and the members, officers, trustees, directors and employees of PCM, PFSI, or their affiliates and to PCM, PFSI and other entities that provide services to PMT and the employees of such other entities.

The 2019 Plan is administered by the Company's compensation committee, pursuant to authority delegated by PMT's board of trustees, which has the authority to make awards to the eligible participants referenced above, and to determine what form the awards will take, and the terms and conditions of the awards.

The 2019 Plan allows for the grant of restricted and performance-based share and unit awards.

The shares underlying award grants will again be available for award under the 2019 Plan if:

* ·any shares subject to an award granted under the equity incentive plan are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or surrendered;
* ·an award terminates or expires without a distribution of shares to the participant; or
* ·shares are surrendered or withheld by PMT as payment of either the exercise price of an award and/or withholding taxes for an award.

Restricted share units have been awarded to trustees and officers of the Company and to other employees of PFSI and its subsidiaries at no cost to the grantees. Such awards generally vest over a one- to three-year period.

The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation activity:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |

(1)The actual number of performance-based restricted share units ("RSUs") that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 48,372 Common Shares, which is approximately 39% of the originally granted performance-based RSUs.

| Grant date average fair value per unit | 14.29 | 14.07 |

Note 23-Income Taxes
--------------------

The Company's effective tax rate was 48.1% and 28.1% with consolidated pretax income of $118.4 million and $204.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") recognized a tax expense of $57.1 million on pretax income of $234.0 million and a tax expense of $56.5 million on pretax income of $221.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the same periods in 2022, the TRS recognized a tax expense of $80.8 million on pretax income of $344.8 million and a tax expense of $151.3 million on pretax income of $765.2 million, respectively. The Company's reported consolidated pretax income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $90.4 million and $68.6 million, respectively. The primary difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction.

The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2023, the valuation allowance remains zero. The conclusion was primarily based on the fact that the TRS has reported cumulative GAAP income over the last three-year period ending September 30, 2023. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income.

In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a 20% deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.

Note 24-Earnings Per Common Share
---------------------------------

The Company grants restricted share units that entitle the recipients to receive dividend equivalents during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Shares. Unvested share-based compensation awards containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, "dividends") are classified as "participating securities" and are included in the basic earnings per share calculation using the two-class method.

Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to Common Shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders (net income reduced by preferred dividends and income attributable to the participating securities) by the weighted average Common Shares outstanding during the period.

The following table summarizes the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Net income (loss) | 61,422 $ | 11,913 $ | 146,743 | $ (77,950 ) |
| Dividends on preferred shares | (10,455 ) | (10,455 ) | (31,364 ) | (31,364 ) |
| Effect of participating securities-share-based compensation awards | (147 ) | (111 ) | (332 ) | (318 ) |
| Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders | 50,820 | 1,347 | 115,047 | (109,632 ) |
| Interest on Exchangeable Notes, net of income taxes | 6,359 | - | 18,773 | - |
| Loss attributable to participating securities | (4 ) | - | (35 ) | - |
| Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders | 57,175 | 1,347 | 133,785 | (109,632 ) |
| Weighted average basic shares outstanding | 86,760 | 90,594 | 87,613 | 92,221 |
| Dilutive securities-Shares issuable pursuant to exchange of the Exchangeable Notes | 24,328 | - | 24,328 | - |
| Diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 111,088 | 90,594 | 111,941 | 92,221 |
| Basic earnings (loss) per share | 0.59 | $ 0.01 | $ 1.31 | $ (1.19 ) |
| Diluted earnings (loss) per share | 0.51 $ | 0.01 | $ 1.20 | $ (1.19 ) |

Calculation of diluted earnings per share requires certain potentially dilutive shares to be excluded when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potentially dilutive shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as inclusion of such shares would have been antidilutive:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Note 26-Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------

The Company, through PMC, is subject to financial eligibility requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for sellers/servicers eligible to sell or service mortgage loans with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The Agencies' capital and liquidity amounts and requirements are summarized below:

| | | | Tangible net worth / total assets ratio (1) | Tangible net worth / total assets ratio (1) | Liquidity (1) | Liquidity (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac | Actual | Required | Actual | Required | Actual | Required |
| | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands) |
| September 30, 2023 (2) | $ 872,644 | $ 588,227 | 13 % | 6 % | $ 432,844 | $ 205,181 |
| December 31, 2022 | $ 1,138,331 | $ 586,436 | 16 % | 6 % | $ 343,286 | $ 79,372 |

(2)The Agencies adopted revised capital and liquidity requirements, most of which became effective on September 30, 2023. The amounts shown for September 30, 2023 are in compliance with those requirements. The Agencies have pending origination liquidity requirements that will be effective on December 31, 2023. The Company believes it is in compliance with the Agencies' pending liquidity requirements as of September 30, 2023.

Noncompliance with the Agencies' capital and liquidity requirements can result in the Agencies taking various remedial actions up to and including removing the Company's ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the Agencies.

Our Company
-----------

We are a specialty finance company that invests in mortgage-related assets. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. A significant portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage-related assets that we have created through our correspondent production activities, including mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), subordinate mortgage-backed securities ("MBS"), and credit risk transfer ("CRT") arrangements, which include CRT Agreements ("CRT Agreements") and CRT strips that absorb credit losses on certain of the loans we sold. We also invest in Agency and senior non-Agency MBS, subordinate credit-linked MBS and interest-only ("IO") stripped MBS. We have also historically invested in distressed mortgage assets (distressed loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans ("REO")), which we have substantially liquidated.

We are externally managed by PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ("PCM"), an investment adviser that specializes in and focuses on U.S. mortgage assets. Our loans and MSRs are serviced by PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ("PLS"). PCM and PLS are both indirect controlled subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ("PFSI"), a publicly-traded mortgage banking and investment management company separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

We operate our business in four segments: Credit sensitive strategies, Interest rate sensitive strategies, Correspondent production and our Corporate operations as described below:

* ·The credit sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in CRT arrangements referencing loans from our own correspondent production, including CRT agreements and other CRT securities (together, "CRT arrangements") and subordinate MBS.
* ·The interest rate sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in MSRs, Agency, senior non-Agency and IO stripped MBS and the related interest rate hedging activities.
* ·The correspondent production segment represents our operations aimed at serving as an intermediary between lenders and the capital markets by purchasing, pooling and reselling newly originated prime credit quality loans either directly or in the form of MBS, using the services of PCM and PLS.
* We primarily sell the loans we acquire through our correspondent production activities to government-sponsored entities ("GSEs") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or to PLS for sale into securitizations guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") or the GSEs. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are each referred to as an "Agency" and, collectively, as the "Agencies."

·The corporate segment includes management fees, corporate expense amounts and certain interest income and expense.

Our Investment Activities
-------------------------

Credit Sensitive Investments
----------------------------

CRT Arrangements
----------------

We held net CRT-related investments (comprised of deposits securing CRT arrangements, CRT derivatives, CRT strips and an interest-only security payable) totaling approximately $1.1 billion at September 30, 2023.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Subordinate Credit-Linked Mortgage-Backed Securities
----------------------------------------------------

Subordinate credit-linked MBS provide us with a higher yield than senior securities. However, we retain credit risk in the subordinate credit-linked MBS since they are the first securities to absorb credit losses relating to the underlying loans. We purchased approximately $70.6 million of subordinate credit-linked MBS during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We held subordinate credit-linked MBS with fair values totaling approximately $277.1 million at September 30, 2023.

As the result of the Company's consolidation of the variable interest entities that issued certain subordinate MBS as described in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities -Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report, we include the loans underlying these transactions with unpaid principal balances ("UPB") totaling approximately $1.8 billion on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.

Interest Rate Sensitive Investments
-----------------------------------

Our interest rate sensitive investments include:
------------------------------------------------

* ·Mortgage servicing rights. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received approximately $58.6 million and $249.9 million, respectively, of MSRs as proceeds from sales of loans acquired for sale. We held approximately $4.1 billion of MSRs at fair value at September 30, 2023.
* ·REIT-eligible Agency, senior non-Agency and IO MBS, or mortgage-related securities. We purchased approximately $408.5 million Agency fixed-rate passthrough securities and senior non-Agency MBS, net of sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We held Agency fixed-rate pass-through, senior non-Agency and IO MBS with fair values totaling approximately $4.4 billion at September 30, 2023.

Correspondent Production
------------------------

Our correspondent production activities involve the acquisition and sale of newly originated prime credit quality residential loans. Correspondent production has served as the source of our investments in MSRs, private label non-Agency securitizations and CRT arrangements. Our correspondent production and resulting investment activity are summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Sales of loans acquired for sale: | | | | |
| To nonaffiliates | $ 3,107,613 | $ 9,709,969 | $ 13,576,673 | $ 31,922,573 |
| To PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. | 18,725,228 | 12,561,276 | 50,812,386 | 36,544,166 |
| | $ 21,832,841 | $ 22,271,245 | $ 64,389,059 | $ 68,466,739 |
| Net gains on loans acquired for sale | $ 13,558 | $ 4,313 | $ 24,477 | $ 15,937 |
| Investment activities resulting from correspondent production: | | | | |
| Receipt of MSRs as proceeds from sales of loans | $ 58,560 | $ 178,001 | $ 249,925 | $ 543,255 |
| Retention of interests in securitizations of loans secured by investment properties, net of associated asset-backed financings | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ 23,485 |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased newly originated prime credit quality residential loans with fair values totaling $63.7 billion as compared to $67.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, in our correspondent production business. To the extent that we purchase loans that are insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through the Federal Housing Administration, or insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or U.S. Department of Agriculture, we and PLS have agreed that PLS will fulfill and purchase such loans, as PLS is a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and we are not. This arrangement has enabled us to compete with other correspondent aggregators that purchase both government and conventional loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also sold $21.0 billion, in UPB of conventional loans to PLS in order to optimize our use and allocation of capital.

Our purchase volume included $50.8 billion and $36.5 billion of loans we sold to PLS during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We receive a sourcing fee from PLS based on the UPB of each loan that we sell to PLS under such arrangement, and earn interest income on the loan for the period we hold it before the sale to PLS. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received sourcing fees totaling $5.0 million, relating to $50.1 billion, in UPB of loans that we sold to PLS.

Taxation
--------

We believe that we qualify to be taxed as a REIT and as such will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our income that is distributed to shareholders as long as we meet applicable REIT asset, income and share ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our profits will be subject to income taxes and we may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the four tax years following the year we lose our REIT qualification.

A portion of our activities, including our correspondent production business, is conducted in our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, we make a provision for income taxes with respect to the operations of our TRS. We expect that the effective rate for the provision for income taxes may be volatile in future periods. Our goal is to manage the business to take full advantage of the tax benefits afforded to us as a REIT.

We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, taxable loss carryback availability, expectations of sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of taxable income in recent years, the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if required. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related deferred tax assets become deductible.

Non-Cash Investment Income
--------------------------

A substantial portion of our net investment income is comprised of non-cash items, including fair value adjustments and recognition of the fair value of assets created and liabilities incurred in loan sale transactions. Because we have elected, or are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), to record certain of our financial assets (comprised of MBS, loans acquired for sale at fair value, and loans at fair value), our derivatives and CRT strips, our MSRs, and our asset-backed financings and interest-only security payable at fair value, a substantial portion of the income or loss we record with respect to such assets and liabilities results from non-cash changes in fair value.

The amounts of net non-cash investment (loss) income items included in net investment income are as follows:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |

| Non-cash items as a percentage of net investment income | 92 % | (11 % ) | 76 % | 44 % |

(1)Amount represents MSRs received, liability for representations and warranties incurred in loan sales transactions and changes in fair value of loans, IRLCs and hedging derivatives held at period end.

(2)Includes fair value changes related to MSR derivative hedging instruments.

We receive or pay cash relating to:
-----------------------------------

·Our investment in mortgage-backed securities through monthly principal and interest payments from the issuer of such securities or from the sale of the investment;

* ·Loan investments when the investments are paid down, paid off or sold, when payments of principal and interest occur on such loans or when the properties acquired in settlement of loans are sold;

·CRT arrangements through a portion of the interest payments collected on loans in the CRT arrangements' reference pools, interest payments from the investment of the deposits securing the arrangement in short-term investments and the release to us of the deposits securing the arrangements as principal on such loans is repaid;

·Hedging instruments when we receive or make margin deposits as the fair value of respective instruments change, when the instruments mature or when we effectively cancel the transactions through offsetting trades;

·Our liability for representations and warranties when we repurchase loans or settle loss claims from investors; and

·MSRs in the form of loan servicing fees and placement fees on the deposits we manage on behalf of the borrowers and investors in the loans we service.

Results of Operations
---------------------

Business Trends
---------------

Due to ongoing inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve continued to raise the federal funds rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and continues to reduce the federal government's overall holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Higher interest rates and a slowing economy and housing market are expected to continue to reduce the size of the mortgage origination market from an estimated $2.3 trillion in 2022 to a projected range of $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion for 2023 according to mortgage lending industry economists.

Higher interest rates have caused a decrease in mortgage production activities and increased competition in the mortgage production business, while also leading to a reduction in prepayment speeds in our mortgage servicing portfolio from the same time in the prior year. Higher interest rates have increased the costs of floating rate borrowings and have generated more interest income from our custodial placement fees on deposits and loans held for sale. We have also increased our sales of conventional loans to PLS during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and we intend to continue to sell a portion of our conventional loans to PLS in the fourth quarter of 2023 to optimize our use and allocation of capital.

Increasing interest rates may also lead to a reduction in economic activity and slowing home price growth or depreciation, which could lead to increasing mortgage delinquencies or defaults and increased losses. If these effects are realized, they could negatively affect the performance of our credit-sensitive assets such as CRT or subordinate credit-linked notes. However, many of the loans underlying our assets have favorable credit characteristics including low loan-to-value ratios, which are likely to help offset the negative effects of credit performance in an economic downturn.

The competitive landscape for our correspondent business has also been affected by the exit of several large entities, which may present an opportunity for growth of our share in that business.

The following is a summary of our key performance measures:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |

Our results of operations increased by $49.5 million and $224.7 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting the effect of decreased losses on MBS, increased valuation of CRT-related investments and a reduced provision for income taxes, offset by the fair value performance of our MSR investments.

The increase in the quarterly pretax results is summarized below:

* ·Our credit sensitive strategies segment recognized a $25.8 million increase in net gains on our CRT arrangements as credit spreads tightened due to supply and demand dynamics and an improving macroeconomic outlook compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2022, in which the macroeconomic outlook was worsening.
* ·Our interest rate sensitive strategies segment benefited less due to reduced interest rate sensitivity of our assets during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2022, resulting in a $107.4 million decrease in valuation losses on MBS, offset by a $108.8 million decrease in net servicing fees caused by lower valuation gains net of hedge impact in MSRs.

·Our correspondent production segment recognized a $9.2 million increase in gains on sales of loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reflecting improved gain on sale margins and a reduction of our liability for representations and warranties partially offset by reduced volume of sales to nonaffiliates.

The increase in the nine months pretax results is summarized below:

·Our credit sensitive strategies segment recognized a $210.5 million increase in net gains on our CRT arrangements as credit spreads tightened due to supply and demand dynamics and an improving macroeconomic outlook compared to the effect of credit spread widening on CRT fair values during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

* ·Our interest rate sensitive strategies segment benefited less from the slower rise in interest rates and reduced interest rate sensitivity of our assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the significantly increasing interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, resulting in a $493.1 million decrease in losses on MBS, offset by a $545.2 million decrease in net servicing fees caused by reduced valuation gains net of hedges in our investment in MSRs.

·Our correspondent production segment recognized an $8.5 million increase in gains on sales of loans held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting improved gain on sale margins and a reduction in our liability for representations and warranties partially offset by reduced volume of sale to nonaffiliates.

Net Investment Income

Our net investment income is summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |

| | $ 163,429 | $ 151,065 | $ 344,247 | $ 254,404 |

Net Loan Servicing Fees
-----------------------

Our net loan servicing fees have two primary components: fees earned for servicing loans and the effects of MSR valuation changes, net of hedging results, as summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Loan servicing fees | $ 170,561 | $ 167,233 | $ 511,043 | $ 481,560 |
| Effect of MSRs and hedging results | 110,737 | 222,891 | (144,605 ) | 430,055 |
| Net loan servicing fees | $ 281,298 | $ 390,124 | $ 366,438 | $ 911,615 |

Following is a summary of our loan servicing fees:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Contractually-specified servicing fees | $ 166,809 | $ 162,987 | $ 496,522 | $ 461,021 |
| Ancillary and other fees: | | | | |
| Late charges | 878 | 662 | 2,442 | 1,883 |
| Other | 2,874 | 3,584 | 12,079 | 18,656 |
| | 3,752 | 4,246 | 14,521 | 20,539 |
| | $ 170,561 | $ 167,233 | $ 511,043 | $ 481,560 |
| Average MSR servicing portfolio | $ 231,333,064 | $ 224,756,659 | $ 231,333,990 | $ 220,988,459 |

Loan servicing fees relate to our MSRs which are primarily related to servicing we provide for loans included in Agency securitizations. These fees are contractually established at an annualized percentage of the UPB of the loans serviced and we collect these fees from borrower payments. Other loan servicing fees are comprised primarily of borrower-contracted fees, such as late charges and reconveyance fees, and fees charged to correspondent lenders for loans repaid by the borrower shortly after purchase.

The change in contractually-specified fees during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022, is due primarily to increased servicing fees resulting from the growth in our loan servicing portfolio.

We have elected to carry our servicing assets at fair value. Changes in fair value have two components: changes due to realization of the contractual servicing fees and changes due to changes in inputs used to estimate the fair value of such items. We endeavor to moderate the effects of changes in fair value primarily by entering into derivatives transactions.

Changes in fair value of MSRs and hedging results are summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Change in fair value of MSRs | | | | |
| Changes in valuation inputs used in valuation model | $ 263,139 | $ 162,730 | $ 232,414 | $ 775,792 |
| Recapture income from PFSI | 500 | 1,648 | 1,494 | 13,232 |
| Hedging results | (50,689 ) | 154,269 | (81,584 ) | (87,651 ) |
| | 212,950 | 318,647 | 152,324 | 701,373 |
| Realization of cash flows | (102,213 ) | (95,756 ) | (296,929 ) | (271,318 ) |
| | 110,737 | 222,891 | (144,605 ) | 430,055 |
| Average balance of mortgage servicing rights | $ 4,054,265 | $ 3,780,826 | $ 4,014,783 | $ 3,499,318 |

Changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs used in our valuation model during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflect the effects of significantly increasing interest rates. The magnitude of the change in fair value of the MSRs compared to the same periods in 2022 is impacted by both the magnitude of the interest rate changes and the interest rate and prepayment sensitivity of the MSR in each period, which changes based on the relationship of the interest rates of the underlying mortgages and the level of market interest rates.

The decrease in loan recapture income from PFSI reflects the decrease in refinancing activity in our MSR portfolio during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. We have an agreement with PFSI that requires that when PFSI refinances a loan for which we held the MSRs, we receive a recapture fee. The MSR recapture agreement is summarized in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties -Operating Activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

Hedging results reflect valuation losses in hedges against interest rates during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, during which interest rates increased, as do the hedging results from the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Hedging results reflect valuation gains in hedges against increasing costs of financing and discount rates during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, during which short term interest rates in particular rose very sharply.

Changes in realization of cash flows are influenced by changes in the level of servicing assets and liabilities and changes in estimates of remaining cash flows to be realized. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, realization of cash flows increased primarily due to growth of our investment in MSRs as compared to the same periods in 2022.

Following is a summary of our loan servicing portfolio:

| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| UPB of loans outstanding | $ | 230,066,301 | $ | 229,858,573 |
| Collection status (UPB) | | | | |
| Delinquency: | | | | |
| 30-89 days delinquent | $ | 2,005,518 | $ | 1,903,007 |
| 90 or more days delinquent: | | | | |
| Not in foreclosure | $ | 944,892 | $ | 880,841 |
| In foreclosure | $ | 69,656 | $ | 70,921 |
| Bankruptcy | $ | 170,596 | $ | 123,239 |
| Custodial funds managed by the Company (1) | $ | 2,760,857 | $ | 1,783,157 |

(1)Custodial funds include borrower and investor custodial cash accounts relating to loans serviced under mortgage servicing agreements and are not included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company earns placement fees on certain of the custodial funds it manages on behalf of the loans' borrowers and investors, which are included in Interest income in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Following is a summary of characteristics of our MSR servicing portfolio as of September 30, 2023:

| | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average | Average |

The changes in Net gains on loans acquired for sale during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022, reflect the effect of increased gain on sale margins for mortgage loans and a reduction in our liability for representations and warranties partially offset by reduced volume of sales to nonaffiliates.

Non-cash elements of gain on sale of loans:
-------------------------------------------

Interest Rate Lock Commitments
------------------------------

Our Net gains on loans acquired for sale includes our estimates of gains or losses we expect to realize upon the sale of mortgage loans we have committed to purchase but have not yet purchased or sold. Therefore, we recognize a substantial portion of our net gains before we purchase the loans. These gains are reflected on our balance sheet as IRLC derivative assets and liabilities. We adjust the fair value of our IRLCs as the loan acquisition process progresses until we complete the acquisition or the commitment is canceled. Such adjustments are included in our Net gains on loans acquired for sale . The fair value of our IRLCs becomes part of the carrying value of our loans when we complete the purchase of the loans. The methods and key inputs we use to measure the fair value of IRLCs are summarized in Note 7 - Fair value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

The MSRs and liability for representations and warranties we recognize represent our estimate of the fair value of future benefits and costs we will realize for years in the future. These estimates change as circumstances change, and changes in these estimates are recognized in our results of operations in subsequent periods. Subsequent changes in the fair value of our MSRs significantly affect our results of operations.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
-------------------------

The methods we use to measure and update the measurements of our MSRs as well as the effect of changes in valuation inputs on MSR fair value are detailed in Note 7 - Fair value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

Liability for Losses Under Representations and Warranties
---------------------------------------------------------

We recognize a liability for losses we expect to incur relating to the representations and warranties we provide to purchasers in our loan sales transactions. The representations and warranties require adherence to purchaser and insurer origination and underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to the validity of the lien securing the loan, property eligibility, borrower credit, income and asset requirements, and compliance with applicable federal, state and local law.

We recorded a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties relating to current loan sales of $448,000 and $2.1 million, respectively, for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The decrease in the provision relating to current loan sales reflects the decrease of our loan sales volume to nonaffiliates and reduced default and loss-given default assumptions.

In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer against credit losses attributable to the loans with indemnified defects. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit loss on the loans. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent sellers that, in turn, had sold such loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. In such event, we have the right to seek a recovery of those repurchase losses from that correspondent seller.

Following is a summary of the indemnification, repurchase and loss activity and loans subject to representations and warranties:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Indemnification activity (UPB): | | | | |
| Loans indemnified at beginning of period | $ 12,148 | $ 4,750 | $ 8,108 | $ 2,782 |
| New indemnifications | 1,734 | 907 | 6,522 | 2,875 |
| Less: Indemnified loans repaid, expired or refinanced | 1,980 | 682 | 2,728 | 682 |
| Loans indemnified at end of period | $ 11,902 | $ 4,975 | $ 11,902 | $ 4,975 |
| Indemnified loans indemnified by correspondent lenders at end of period | | | $ 4,076 | $ 1,312 |
| UPB of loans with deposits received from correspondent sellers collateralizing prospective indemnification losses at end of period | | | $ 4,190 | $ 2,047 |
| Repurchase activity (UPB): | | | | |
| Loans repurchased | $ 13,908 | $ 20,909 | $ 50,849 | $ 72,933 |
| Less: | | | | |
| Loans repurchased by correspondent sellers | 14,383 | 19,076 | 46,063 | 60,448 |
| Loans resold or repaid by borrowers | 1,469 | 10,884 | 11,081 | 25,967 |
| Net loans repurchased (resolved) with losses chargeable to liability to representations and warranties | $ (1,944 ) | $ (9,051 ) | $ (6,295 | $ (13,482 |
| Losses charged to liability for representations and warranties | $ - | $ 122 | $ 525 | $ 681 |
| At end of period: | | | | |
| Loans subject to representations and warranties | | | $ 228,679,429 | $ 225,129,199 |
| Liability for representations and warranties | | | $ 33,152 | $ 39,498 |

The losses on representations and warranties we have recorded to date have been moderated by our ability to recover most of the losses inherent in the repurchased loans from the correspondent sellers. As the outstanding balance of loans, we purchase and sell subject to representations and warranties increases, as the loans sold mature, as our investors' and guarantors' loss mitigation strategies change and as our correspondent sellers' ability and willingness to repurchase loans change, we expect that the level of repurchase activity and associated losses may increase.

The method we use to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of our estimates of future defaults, loan repurchase rates, severity of loss in the event of default and the probability of reimbursement by the correspondent loan seller. We establish a liability at our estimate of its fair value at the time loans are sold and review our liability estimate on a periodic basis.

The amount of the liability for representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable judgment. The level of loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, investor loss mitigation strategies, our ability to recover any losses inherent in the repurchased loan from the correspondent seller and other external conditions that change over the lives of the underlying loans. We may be required to incur losses related to such representations and warranties for several periods after the loans are sold or liquidated.

We record adjustments to our liability for losses on representations and warranties as economic fundamentals change, as investor and Agency evaluations of their loss mitigation strategies (including claims under representations and warranties) change and as economic conditions affect our correspondent sellers' ability or willingness to fulfill their recourse obligations to us. Such adjustments may be material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods.

Adjustments to our liability for representations and warranties are included as a component of our Net gains on loans acquired for sale at fair value . We recorded a $4.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively, reduction in liability for representations and warranties during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an $817,000 and $3.5 million reduction in liability for representations and warranties during the same periods in 2022 due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans.

Loan Origination Fees
---------------------

Loan origination fees represent fees we charge correspondent sellers relating to our purchase of loans from those sellers. The decrease in fees during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022, reflects a decrease in our purchases of loans with delivery fees.

Net (losses) gains on investments and financings
------------------------------------------------

Net (losses) gains on investments and financings are summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| From nonaffiliates: | | | | |
| Mortgage-backed securities | $ (144,031 ) | $ (251,477 ) | $ (127,434 ) | $ (620,500 ) |
| Loans at fair value: | | | | |
| Held in consolidated variable interest entities | (54,082 ) | (99,267 ) | (61,318 ) | (318,300 ) |
| Distressed | (59 ) | 56 | (485 ) | 504 |
| CRT arrangements | 30,154 | 4,359 | 136,890 | (73,619 ) |
| Asset-backed financings at fair value | 58,474 | 92,993 | 66,108 | 298,834 |
| | $ (109,544 ) | $ (253,336 ) | $ 13,761 | $ (713,081 ) |

The increase in net gains on investments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022, was primarily due to improved performance from our investments in MBS and CRT arrangements as interest rates increased at a slower rate during 2023 as compared to 2022, reducing losses on MBS, and credit spreads tightened (a decrease in the interest rate premium demanded by investors for instruments over those that are considered "risk free"), in 2023 as compared to widening in 2022, which benefited the fair value of our investment in CRT arrangements.

Mortgage-Backed Securities
--------------------------

During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net valuation losses of $144.0 million and $127.4 million, respectively, as compared to valuation losses of $251.5 million and $620.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022. The changes recognized reflect a slower rate of increase in interest rates along with credit spread tightening during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the effect of significantly increasing interest rates and credit spread widening on fair value during the same periods in 2022.

Loans at fair value - Held in VIEs and Asset-Backed Financings at Fair Value

Loans at fair value held in VIEs and Asset-backed financings at fair value recorded net valuation gains of $4.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a net loss of $6.3 million and $19.5 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2022. The net gain during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflects the effect of credit spread tightening during the periods compared to the same periods in 2022 when interest rates increased significantly and credit spreads widened.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

(1) Deposits securing credit risk transfer strip liabilities also secure $70.9 million and $160.6 million in CRT strip and CRT derivative liabilities at September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The performance of our investments in CRT arrangements during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects credit spread tightening for CRT securities in the credit markets. This contrasts with CRT investments' fair value losses during the same periods in 2022, when credit spreads widened.

The increase in net interest expense during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022, is due to an increase in interest costs attributable to financing non-interest earning MSR assets along with faster repricing of our debt than our interest earning assets, partially offset by an increase in placement fees relating to custodial funds.

Loan servicing fees payable to PLS are summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |

| Average MSR portfolio UPB | $ 231,333,064 | $ 224,756,659 | $ 231,333,990 | $ 220,988,459 |

Loan servicing fees increased by $10,000 and decreased $647,000 during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022. We incur loan servicing fees primarily in support of our MSR portfolio. The limited growth or decrease in loan servicing fees is due to reductions in COVID-19 pandemic-related forbearance and modification activities, partially offset by growth in our MSR portfolio.

Loan Fulfillment Fees
---------------------

Loan fulfillment fees represent fees we pay to PLS for the services it performs on our behalf in connection with our acquisition, packaging and sale of loans. Fulfillment fees decreased $12.9 million and $32.9 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The decrease was due to a decrease in loan commitment volume. Our loan fulfillment fee structure is described in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report .

Management Fees

Management fees payable to PCM are summarized below:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |

| Average shareholders' equity amounts used to calculate base management fee expense | $ 1,897,964 | $ 2,048,887 | $ 1,917,525 | $ 2,128,916 |

Management fees decreased by $556,000 and $2.2 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022. This decrease reflects the decrease in our average shareholders' equity during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022.

Loan origination
----------------

Loan origination expenses decreased $1.7 million and $4.3 million, or 71% and 53%, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily reflecting a decrease in our loan originations purchased for sale to nonaffiliates.

Income Taxes
------------

We have elected to treat PMC as a TRS. Income from a TRS is only included as a component of REIT taxable income to the extent that the TRS makes dividend distributions of income to us. A TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes for PMC is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The Company's effective tax rate was 48.1% and 28.1% with consolidated pretax income of a $118.4 million and $204.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's TRS recognized a tax expense of $57.1 million on pretax income of $234.0 million and a tax expense of $56.5 million on pretax income of $221.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the same periods in 2022, the TRS recognized tax expense of $80.8 million on pretax income of $344.8 million and tax expense of $151.3 million on pretax income of $765.2 million, respectively. The Company's reported consolidated pretax income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $90.4 million and $68.6 million, respectively. The primary difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction. The higher effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 is the result of realizing pretax GAAP income at the TRS, where the tax provision is recorded, while realizing a loss in the quarter for the rest of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, excluding the TRS and its subsidiaries.

The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2023, the valuation allowance remains zero as a result of cumulative GAAP income at the TRS for the three-year period ended September 30, 2023. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income.

In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. For tax years

beginning after December 31, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a 20% deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.

Our acquisitions during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were financed through the use of a combination of proceeds from borrowings and liquidations of existing investments. We continue to identify additional means of increasing our investment portfolio through cash flow from our business activities, existing investments, borrowings, and transactions that minimize current cash outlays. However, we expect that, over time, our ability to continue our investment portfolio growth will depend on our ability to raise additional equity capital.

Cash Flows
----------

Our cash flows for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below:

| | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Operating activities | $ 807,162 | $ 1,275,504 |
| Investing activities | 60,482 | (1,342,701 ) |
| Financing activities | (743,114 ) | 67,145 |
| Net cash flows | $ 124,530 | $ (52 ) |

Our cash flows resulted in a net increase in cash of $124.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as discussed below.

Operating activities
--------------------

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $807.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to cash provided by our operating activities of $1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Cash flows from operating activities are most influenced by cash flows from loans acquired for sale as shown below:

| | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Operating cash flows from: | | |
| Loans acquired for sale | $ 639,045 | $ 1,011,398 |
| Other | 168,117 | 264,106 |
| | $ 807,162 | $ 1,275,504 |

Cash flows from loans acquired for sale primarily reflect changes in the level of production inventory from the beginning to end of the periods presented. Our inventory of loans held for sale decreased during both of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2023.

Investing activities
--------------------

Net cash provided by our investing activities was $60.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net cash used in our investing activities of $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the increase of our sales and repayments of MBS in excess of purchases of our investments in such assets as well as a decrease in short-term investments and margin deposits.

Financing activities
--------------------

Net cash used in our financing activities was $743.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by our financing activities of $67.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This change primarily reflects decreased financing requirements relating to loans acquired for sale.

As discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources , our Manager continually evaluates and pursues additional sources of financing to provide us with future investing capacity. We do not raise equity or enter into borrowings for the purpose of financing the payment of dividends. We believe that our cash earnings, are adequate to fund our operating expenses and dividend payment requirements. However, we manage our liquidity in the aggregate and are reinvesting our cash flows in new investments as well as using such cash to fund our dividend requirements.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including the purchase of loans from correspondent sellers, our operating expenses and, when applicable, retirement of, and margin calls relating to, our debt and derivatives positions), make investments as our Manager identifies them, pursue our share repurchase program and make distributions to our shareholders. We generally need to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our shareholders to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital to support our activities.

We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flows from our investment portfolio, including cash earnings on our investments, cash flows from business activities, liquidation of existing investments and proceeds from borrowings and/or additional equity offerings. When we finance a particular asset, the amount borrowed is less than the asset's fair value and we must provide the cash in the amount of such difference. Our ability to continue making investments is dependent on our ability to invest the cash representing such difference.

Debt Financing
--------------

Our current debt financing strategy is to finance our assets where we believe such borrowing is prudent, appropriate and available. We make collateralized borrowings in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase, loan participation purchase and sale agreements and notes payable, including secured term financing for our MSRs and our CRT arrangements that has allowed us to more closely match the term of our borrowings to the expected lives of the assets securing those borrowings. We have also borrowed money by issuing unsecured senior notes.

Our debt financing is summarized below:

| | Assets financed | Assets financed | Assets financed | Assets financed | Assets financed | Assets financed | Assets financed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Financing | MBS | Loans acquired for sale | Loans at fair value | CRT assets (in thousands) | Servicing assets (1) | REO | Total |

| Excluding non-recourse debt | | | | | | | 4.9:1 |

Sales of Assets Under Agreements to Repurchase
----------------------------------------------

Our repurchase agreements represent the sales of assets together with agreements for us to buy back the assets at a later date. Following is a summary of the activities in our repurchase agreements financing:

| | Quarter ended September 30, | Quarter ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assets sold under agreements to repurchase | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Average balance outstanding | $ 5,714,082 | $ 5,789,433 | $ 6,451,377 | $ 5,363,690 |
| Maximum daily balance outstanding | $ 6,318,746 | $ 6,649,005 | $ 9,412,768 | $ 8,395,930 |
| Ending balance | | | $ 6,020,716 | $ 6,409,796 |

The difference between the maximum and average daily amounts outstanding is primarily due to timing of loan purchases and sales in our correspondent production business. The total facility size of our assets sold under agreements to repurchase was approximately $11.5 billion at September 30, 2023.

Because a significant portion of our current debt facilities consists of short-term borrowings, we expect to either renew these facilities in advance of maturity in order to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital or otherwise allow ourselves sufficient time to replace any necessary financing.

As discussed above, all of our repurchase agreements, and mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements have short-term maturities:

* ·The transactions relating to loans and REO under agreements to repurchase generally provide for terms of approximately one to two years;
* ·The transactions relating to loans under mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements provide for terms of approximately one year; and
* ·The transactions relating to assets under notes payable provide for terms ranging from two to five years.

The amount at risk (the fair value of the assets pledged plus the related margin deposit, less the amount advanced by the counterparty and accrued interest) relating to our assets sold under agreements to repurchase is summarized by counterparty below as of September 30, 2023:

| Counterparty | Amount at risk (in thousands) |
| --- | --- |
| Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC | 61,461 |
| Barclays Capital Inc. | 54,893 |
| Atlas Securitized Products, L.P. | 53,974 |

| | 377,645 |

·All repurchase agreements arrangements that matured between September 30, 2023 and the date of this Report have been renewed, extended or replaced. Unsecured Senior Notes

We issued $53.5 million principal amount of our unsecured 8.50% senior notes due September 30, 2028 (the "2023 Senior Notes") during September 2023. The 2023 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.50% per year, payable quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30 of each year, beginning on December 30, 2023.

On or after September 30, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2023 Senior Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No "sinking fund" will be provided for the 2023 Senior Notes.

The 2023 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PennyMac Corp ("PMC"), including the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Unsecured Senior Notes, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise ("PMC Guarantee"). PMC's operations and investing activities are centered in residential mortgage-related assets, including the creation of and investment in MSRs and CRT Agreements.

Under the terms of the PMC Guarantee, holders of the 2023 Senior Notes will not be required to exercise their remedies against us before they proceed directly against PMC. PMC's obligations under the guarantee are limited to the maximum amount that will not, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of PMC, result in the guarantee constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. The PMC Guarantee will:

·rank equal in right of payment to any of PMC's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and guarantees of PMC;

* ·be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of PMC's existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or guarantees; and
* ·be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) and (to the extent not held by PMC) preferred stock, if any, of PMC's subsidiaries and of any entity PMC accounts for using the equity method of accounting.

Debt Covenants
--------------

Our debt financing agreements require us and certain of our subsidiaries to comply with various financial covenants. As of the filing of this Report, these financial covenants include the following:

·a minimum of $75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among the Company and/or our subsidiaries; a minimum of $75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among our Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries; a minimum of $25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents between PMC and PennyMac Holdings, LLC ("PMH"); a minimum of $25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMC; and a minimum of $10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMH;

* ·a minimum tangible net worth for the Company of $1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for our Operating Partnership of $1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for PMH of $250 million; and a minimum tangible net worth for PMC of $300 million;
* ·a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of less than 10:1 for PMC and PMH and 8.5:1 for the Company and our Operating Partnership; and
* ·at least two warehouse or repurchase facilities that finance amounts and assets similar to those being financed under our existing debt financing agreements.

Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur and impact our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose.

PLS is also subject to various financial covenants, both as a borrower under its own financing arrangements and as our servicer under certain of our debt financing agreements. The most significant of these financial covenants currently include the following:

* ·a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $100 million;
* ·a minimum tangible net worth of $1.25 billion;
* ·a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of 10:1; and
* ·at least one other warehouse or repurchase facility that finances amounts and assets that are similar to those being financed under certain of our existing secured financing agreements.

Many of our debt financing agreements contain a condition precedent to obtaining additional funding that requires us to maintain positive net income for at least one (1) of the previous two consecutive quarters, or other similar measures. For the most recent fiscal quarter, the Company is compliant with all such conditions. However, we may be required to obtain waivers from certain lenders in the future if this condition precedent is not met.

Our debt financing agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement, although in some instances we may agree with the lender upon certain thresholds (in dollar amounts or percentages based on the market value of the assets) that must be exceeded before a margin deficit will arise. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice.

Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements
---------------------------------------------

In addition to the financial covenants imposed upon us and PLS as our servicer under our debt financing agreements, we, through PMC and/or PLS, as applicable, are also subject to liquidity and net worth requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") for Agency sellers/servicers and Ginnie Mae for single-family issuers. FHFA and Ginnie Mae have established minimum liquidity and net worth requirements for approved non-depository single-family sellers/servicers in the case of FHFA, and for approved single-family issuers in the case of Ginnie Mae.

In August 2022, the Agencies issued revised capital and liquidity requirements. Most of the requirements became effective on September 30, 2023 for issuers of securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and seller/servicers of mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We believe that we and PLS are in compliance with Agencies' revised requirements. The origination liquidity requirements issued by the Agencies will be effective on December 31, 2023 and risk-based capital requirements issued by Ginnie Mae will be effective on December 31, 2024. We believe that we and PLS are in compliance with the pending applicable requirements as of September 30, 2023.

Our Manager continues to explore a variety of additional means of financing our business, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, repurchase agreements, term financing, securitization transactions and unsecured debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful.

Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain of these estimates significantly influence the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies primarily relate to our fair value estimates.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which utilize relevant critical accounting estimates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
------------------------------------------------------------------

Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market-based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, inflation risk and market value risk.

Our primary trading asset is our inventory of loans acquired for sale. We believe that such assets' fair values respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable recently-originated loans. Our other market-risk assets are a substantial portion of our investments and are primarily comprised of MSRs, CRT arrangements and MBS. We believe that the fair values of MSRs and MBS also respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable loans or yields on MBS. Changes in interest rates are reflected in the prepayment speeds underlying these investments and in the pricing spread (an element of the discount rate) used in their valuation. We believe that the primary market risks to the fair values of our investment in CRT arrangements are changes in market credit spreads and the fair value of the real estate securing the loans underlying such arrangements.

The following sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated variables; do not incorporate changes to other variables; are subject to the accuracy of various models and assumptions used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect our overall financial performance in such scenarios, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the following estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
----------------------------------

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. However, no matter how well a control system is designed and operated, it can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports.

Our management has conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
