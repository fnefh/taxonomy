<h2>SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Report") contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Forwardlooking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "potential," "intend," "expect," "seek," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximately," "believe," "could," "project," "predict," "continue," "plan" or other similar words or expressions.</p>
<p>Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, future plans and strategies, contain financial and operating projections or state other forward-looking information. Examples of forward-looking statements include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>·projections of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or other financial items;</li>
<li>·descriptions of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services;</li>
<li>·forecasts of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets; and</li>
<li>·descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing expectations regarding the timing of generating any revenues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future events, actions, plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations. Some of these factors are discussed below.</p>
<p>You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Report and the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 22, 2024.</p>
<p>Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>·changes in general business, economic, market, employment and domestic and international political conditions, or in consumer confidence and spending habits from those expected;</p>
<p>·the availability of, and level of competition for, attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities in loans and mortgage-related assets that satisfy our investment objectives;</p>
<p>·the inherent difficulty in winning bids to acquire loans, and our success in doing so;</p>
<p>·the concentration of credit risks to which we are exposed;</p>
<p>·our dependence on PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., PNMAC Capital Management, LLC and PennyMac Loan Services, LLC, potential conflicts of interest with such entities and their affiliates, and the performance of such entities;</p>
<p>·changes in personnel and lack of availability of qualified personnel at PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., PNMAC Capital Management, LLC and PennyMac Loan Services, LLC, and their affiliates;</p>

<p>·the adequacy of our cash reserves and working capital;</p>

<li>·the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its issued and future rules and the enforcement thereof;</li>
<li>·changes in government support of homeownership;</li>
<li>·our ability to effectively identify, manage and hedge our credit, interest rate, prepayment, liquidity and climate risks;</li>
<li>·changes in government or government-sponsored home affordability programs;</li>
</ul>
<p>·limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes and qualify for an exclusion from the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to qualify as REITs or as taxable REIT subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules;</p>
<p>·changes in governmental regulations, accounting treatment, tax rates and similar matters (including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs, or the exclusions from registration as an investment company);</p>
<p>·our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in the future;</p>
<p>·our failure to deal appropriately with issues that may give rise to reputational risk; and</p>
<p>·our organizational structure and certain requirements in our charter documents.</p>
<p>Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in this Report or any other document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, income and/or financial condition.</p>
<p>Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.</p>

<li>·The correspondent production segment represents the Company's operations aimed at serving as an intermediary between lenders and the capital markets by purchasing, pooling and reselling newly originated prime credit quality loans either directly or in the form of MBS, using the services of PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ("PCM") and PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ("PLS"), both wholly-owned subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ("PFSI"), a publicly-traded mortgage banking and investment management company separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</li>
<li>The Company primarily sells the loans it acquires through its correspondent production activities to government-sponsored entities ("GSEs") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or to PLS for sale into securitizations guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), or the GSEs. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are each referred to as an "Agency" and, collectively, as the "Agencies."</li>
<li>·The corporate segment includes management fees, corporate expense amounts and certain interest income and expense.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company conducts substantially all of its operations and makes substantially all of its investments through its subsidiary, PennyMac Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the sole general partner, and the Company is the sole limited partner, of the Operating Partnership.</p>
<p>The Company believes that it qualifies, and has elected to be taxed, as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain its tax status as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income in the form of qualifying distributions to shareholders.</p>
<h2>Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification for interim financial information and with the Securities and Exchange Commission's instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements and notes do not include all of the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. This interim consolidated information should be read together with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>These unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, income, and cash flows for the interim periods presented, but are not necessarily indicative of the income that may be anticipated for the full year. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results will likely differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>The Company held no restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents during the periods presented. Therefore, the consolidated statements of cash flows do not include references to restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.</p>
<h2>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>During 2023, the FASB issued two Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") aimed at increasing the amount of detail provided to financial statement users in certain existing disclosures. Neither ASU requires changes to the Company's accounting. The ASUs are discussed below:</p>
<h2>Segment Disclosures</h2>
<p>The FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), that is intended to improve disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses.</p>
<p>The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments will require that the Company supplement its existing disclosures to include disclosure of:</p>
<ul>
<li>·significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; and</li>
</ul>
<p>·an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.</p>
<p>The Company will be required to apply ASU 2023-07 in annual periods beginning with its fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 and for quarterly periods ended thereafter with early adoption permitted.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Disclosures</h2>
<p>The FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), that is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires disclosures of:</p>
<p>·Reconciliation of the expected income tax at the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to the reported income tax in a tabular format, using both percentages and amounts, broken out into specific categories with certain reconciling items of five percent or greater of the expected tax further broken out by nature and/or jurisdiction; and</p>
<ul>
<li>·Income taxes paid, net of refunds received, broken out between federal and state and local income taxes. Payments to individual jurisdictions representing five percent or more of the total income tax payments must also be separately disclosed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The disclosures required by ASU 2023-09 are required in the Company's annual financial statements beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted.</p>
<h2>Note 3-Concentration of Risks</h2>
<p>As discussed in Note 1 Organization above, PMT's operations and investing activities are centered in residential mortgage-related assets, including CRT arrangements, subordinate MBS, Agency and senior Non-Agency MBS and MSRs. CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS are more sensitive to borrower credit performance than other mortgage-related investments such as traditional loans. Agency MBS, Interest-only ("IO") stripped MBS, principal-only stripped MBS and senior non-Agency MBS are sensitive to changes in market interest rates. MSRs are sensitive to changes in market interest rates, prepayment rate activity and expectations.</p>
<h2>Credit Risk</h2>
<p>Note 6 -Variable Interest Entities details the Company's investments in CRT arrangements whereby the Company sold pools of loans into Fannie Mae guaranteed loan securitizations which became reference pools underlying the CRT arrangements. Fannie Mae transferred IO ownership interests and recourse obligations based upon securitized reference pools of loans subject to the CRT arrangements into trust entities, and the Company acquired the IO ownership interest and assumed the recourse obligations in the CRT arrangements through the acquisition of beneficial interests in the trust entities.</p>
<p>The Company also invests in subordinate MBS, which are among the first beneficial interests in the issuing trusts to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans.</p>
<p>The Company's retention of credit risk through its investment in CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS subjects it to risks associated with delinquency and foreclosure similar to the risks of loss associated with owning the underlying loans, which is greater than the risk of loss associated with selling such loans to the Agencies without the retention of such credit risk in the case of CRT arrangements and investing in senior mortgage-backed securities in the case of subordinate MBS.</p>
<p>Certain of the Company's investments in CRT arrangements are structured such that loans that reach a specific number of days delinquent trigger losses chargeable to the CRT arrangements based on the sizes of the delinquent loans and a contractual schedule of loss severity. Therefore, the risks associated with delinquency and foreclosure may in some instances be greater than the risks associated with owning the related loans because the structure of those CRT arrangements provides that the Company may be required to absorb losses in the event of delinquency or foreclosure even when there is ultimately no loss realized with respect to such loans (e.g., as a result of a borrower's re-performance). In contrast, the structure of the Company's other investments in CRT arrangements requires PMT to absorb losses only when the reference loans realize losses.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Risk</h2>
<p>The Company is exposed to fair value risk in addition to the risks specific to credit and, as a result of prevailing market conditions, may be required to recognize losses associated with adverse changes to the fair value of its investments in MSRs, CRT arrangements, and MBS:</p>
<ul>
<li>·The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in prepayment speeds, estimates of cost to service the underlying loans and to the returns demanded by market participants;</li>
<li>·The fair values of CRT arrangements and subordinate MBS are sensitive to market perceptions of future credit performance of the underlying loans as well as the actual credit performance of such loans and to the returns required by market participants to hold such investments; and</li>
<li>·The fair values of Agency and senior non-Agency MBS are sensitive to changes in market interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note 4-Transactions with Related Parties</h2>
<p>The Company enters into transactions with subsidiaries of PFSI in support of its operating, investing and financing activities as summarized below.</p>
<h2>Operating Activities</h2>
<h2>Loan Servicing</h2>
<p>The Company has a loan servicing agreement with PLS (the "Servicing Agreement") pursuant to which PLS provides subservicing for the Company's portfolio of MSRs, loans held for sale and loans held in VIEs (prime servicing), and its portfolio of residential loans purchased with credit deterioration (special servicing). The Servicing Agreement provides for servicing fees earned by PLS that are established at a per loan monthly amount based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure status of the serviced loan or real estate acquired in settlement of loans ("REO").</p>
<h2>Prime Servicing</h2>
<p>The per-loan base servicing fees for prime loans subserviced by PLS on the Company's behalf are $7.50 per month for fixed-rate loans and $8.50 per month for adjustable-rate loans.</p>
<p>To the extent that these prime loans become delinquent, PLS is entitled to an additional servicing fee per loan ranging from $10 to $55 per month based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and foreclosure status of the loan or $75 per month if the underlying mortgaged property becomes REO.</p>
<p>PLS is also entitled to customary ancillary income and certain market-based fees and charges, including boarding and deboarding fees, liquidation and disposition fees, assumption, modification and origination fees and certain fees for pandemic-related forbearance and modification activities.</p>
<h2>Special Servicing</h2>
<p>The per-loan base servicing fee rates for loans purchased with credit deterioration (distressed loans) range from $30 per month for current loans up to $95 per month for loans in foreclosure proceedings. The base servicing fee rate for REO is $75 per month. PLS also receives a supplemental servicing fee of $25 per month for each special servicing loan.</p>
<p>PLS receives activity-based fees for modifications, foreclosures and liquidations that it facilitates with respect to special servicing, as well as other market-based refinancing and loan disposition fees.</p>
<p>The Servicing Agreement expires on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms.</p>
<h2>MSR Recapture Agreement</h2>
<p>The Company has an MSR recapture agreement with PLS. Pursuant to the terms of the MSR recapture agreement, if PLS refinances (recaptures) mortgage loans for which the Company previously held the MSRs, PLS is generally required to transfer and convey to the Company cash in an amount equal to:</p>
<ul>
<li>·40% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the first 15% of the "recapture rate";</li>
<li>·35% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the "recapture rate" in excess of 15% and up to 30%; and</li>
<li>·30% of the fair market value of the MSRs relating to the recaptured loans subject to the "recapture rate" in excess of 30%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "recapture rate" means, during each month, the ratio of (i) the aggregate unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of all recaptured loans, to (ii) the aggregate UPB of all mortgage loans for which the Company held the MSRs and that were refinanced or otherwise paid off in such month. PFSI has further agreed to allocate sufficient resources to target a recapture rate of at least 15%.</p>
<p>The MSR recapture agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18month periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of loan servicing fees and recapture earned by PLS:</p>

<h2>Correspondent Production Activities</h2>
<p>The Company is provided fulfillment and other services for the operation of its correspondent business under an amended and restated mortgage banking services agreement with PLS. These services include: provision of models and technology for the pricing of loans and MSRs; reviews of loan data; documentation and appraisals to assess loan quality and risk; hedging the Company's mortgage pipeline to protect it from fluctuations in value due to movements in interest rates; correspondent seller performance and credit monitoring procedures; and the subsequent sale and securitization of loans through secondary mortgage markets on behalf of the Company.</p>
<p>Fulfillment and sourcing fees are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Fulfillment fees shall not exceed the following:</li>
<li>(i)the number of loan commitments issued by the Company multiplied by a pull-through factor of either .99 or .80 depending on whether the loan commitments are subject to a "mandatory trade confirmation" or a "best efforts lock confirmation", respectively, and then multiplied by $585 for each pullthrough adjusted loan commitment up to and including 16,500 per quarter and $355 for each pull-through adjusted loan commitment in excess of 16,500 per quarter, plus</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii)$315 multiplied by the number of purchased loans up to and including 16,500 per quarter and $195 multiplied by the number of purchased loans in excess of 16,500 per quarter, plus</p>
<p>(iii)$750 multiplied by the number of all purchased loans that are sold or securitized to parties other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; provided however, that no fulfillment fee shall be due or payable to PLS with respect to any Ginnie Mae loans and, as of October 1, 2022, designated Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans acquired by PLS.</p>
<p>The Company does not hold the Ginnie Mae approval required to issue securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae for a pool of securitized loans or to act as a servicer for such pool of loans. Accordingly, under the agreement, PLS currently purchases loans saleable in accordance with the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide "as is" and without recourse of any kind from the Company at cost less any administrative fees paid by the correspondent to the Company plus accrued interest and a sourcing fee. The Company may also sell conventional loans to PLS under the same arrangement subject to mutual agreement between the parties. Sourcing fees range from one to two basis points of the loans' UPB, generally based on the average number of calendar days the loans are held by PMT before purchase by PLS.</p>
<p>The mortgage banking services agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p>The Company may purchase newly originated conforming balance non-government insured or guaranteed loans from PLS under a mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement.</p>

<h2>Management Fees</h2>
<p>The Company has a management agreement with PCM pursuant to which PMT pays PCM management fees as follows:</p>
<p>The performance incentive fee is equal to the sum of:</p>
<ul>
<li>·10% of the amount by which "net income" for the quarter exceeds (i) an 8% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark", up to (ii) a 12% return on "equity"; plus</li>
<li>·15% of the amount by which "net income" for the quarter exceeds (i) a 12% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark", up to (ii) a 16% return on "equity"; plus</li>
<li>·20% of the amount by which "net income" for the quarter exceeds a 16% return on "equity" plus the "high watermark."</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee:</p>
<p>"Net income" is defined as net income or loss attributable to the Company's common shares of beneficial interest ("Common Shares") calculated in accordance with GAAP, and adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussion between PCM and the Company's independent trustees and after approval by a majority of the Company's independent trustees.</p>
<p>"Equity" is the weighted average of the issue price per Common Share of all of the Company's public offerings, multiplied by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding (including restricted share units) in the rolling four-quarter period.</p>
<p>"High watermark" is the quarterly adjustment that reflects the amount by which the "net income" (stated as a percentage of return on "equity") in that quarter exceeds or falls short of the lesser of 8% and the average Fannie Mae 30-year MBS yield (the "Target Yield") for the four quarters then ended. The "high watermark" starts at zero and is adjusted quarterly. If the "net income" is lower than the Target Yield, the "high watermark" is increased by the difference. If the "net income" is higher than the Target Yield, the "high watermark" is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the "high watermark" returns to zero. As a result, the threshold amounts required for PCM to earn a performance incentive fee are adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT's "net income" over (or under) the Target Yield, until the "net income" in excess of the Target Yield exceeds the then-current cumulative "high watermark" amount.</p>
<p>The base management fee and the performance incentive fee are both payable quarterly in arrears. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or a combination of cash and the Company's Common Shares (subject to a limit of no more than 50% paid in Common Shares), at the Company's option.</p>
<p>In the event of termination of the management agreement between the Company and PCM, PCM may be entitled to a termination fee in certain circumstances. The termination fee is equal to three times the sum of (a) the average annual base management fee, and (b) the average annual performance incentive fee earned by PCM, in each case during the 24-month period before termination of the management agreement.</p>

<h2>Expense Reimbursement</h2>
<p>Under the management agreement, PCM is entitled to reimbursement of its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on the Company's behalf, it being understood that PCM and its affiliates shall allocate a portion of their personnel's time to provide certain legal, tax and investor relations services for the direct benefit of the Company. PCM is reimbursed $165,000 per fiscal quarter for these services, such amount to be reviewed annually and to not preclude reimbursement for any other services performed by PCM or its affiliates.</p>
<p>The Company is required to pay PCM and its affiliates a portion of the rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of PCM and its affiliates required for the Company's and its subsidiaries' operations. These expenses are allocated based on the ratio of the Company's and its subsidiaries' proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed or owned by PCM and/or its affiliates as calculated at each fiscal quarter end.</p>

<h2>Note 6-Variable Interest Entities</h2>
<p>The Company is a variable interest holder in various VIEs that relate to its investing and financing activities as discussed below.</p>
<h2>Credit Risk Transfer Arrangements</h2>
<p>The Company has previously entered into certain loan sales arrangements pursuant to which it accepted credit risk relating to the loans sold in exchange for a portion of the interest earned on such loans. These arrangements absorb scheduled or realized credit losses on those loans and comprise the Company's investments in CRT arrangements.</p>
<p>The Company, through its subsidiary, PennyMac Corp. ("PMC"), entered into CRT arrangements with Fannie Mae, pursuant to which the Company sold pools of loans into Fannie Mae-guaranteed securitizations while retaining recourse obligations as part of the retention of IO ownership interests in such loans and include securities which are structured such that loans that reach a specific number of days delinquent (including loans in forbearance) trigger losses chargeable to the CRT arrangement based on the sizes of the delinquent loans and a contractual schedule of loss severity; and securities which require the Company to absorb losses only when the reference loans realize credit losses.</p>
<p>The Company placed Deposits securing CRT arrangements into subsidiary trust entities to secure its recourse obligations. The Deposits securing CRT arrangements represent the Company's maximum contractual exposure to claims under its recourse obligations and are the sole source of settlement of losses under the CRT arrangements.</p>
<p>The Company's exposure to losses under its recourse obligations was initially established at rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.0% of the UPB of the loans sold under the CRT arrangements. As the UPB of the underlying loans subject to each CRT arrangement decreased through repayments, the percentage exposure of each CRT arrangement increased to maximums ranging from 4.5% to 5.0% of outstanding UPB, although the total dollar amount of exposure to losses did not increase.</p>
<p>The Company has concluded that the subsidiary trust entities holding its CRT arrangements are VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs as it is the holder of the primary beneficial interests which absorb the variability of the trusts' income. For CRT arrangements where losses are triggered based on the loans' delinquency status, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as CRT Derivatives in Derivative assets and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. For CRT securities where losses are absorbed when the reference loans realize credit losses, the Company recognizes its IO ownership interests and recourse obligations as CRT strips which are also included on the consolidated balance sheet in Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities. Gains and losses on the derivatives and strips (including the IO ownership interest sold to nonaffiliates) included in the CRT arrangements are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income.</p>

<h2>Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2>
<p>The Company retains or purchases subordinate MBS in transactions sponsored by PMC or a nonaffiliate. Cash inflows from the loans underlying these securities are distributed to investors and service providers in accordance with the respective securities' contractual priority of payments and, as such, most of these inflows must be directed first to service and repay the senior securities.</p>
<p>The rights of holders of subordinate securities to receive distributions of principal and/or interest, as applicable, are subordinate to the rights of holders of senior securities. After the senior securities are repaid, substantially all cash inflows will be directed to the subordinate securities, including those held by the Company, until they are fully repaid.</p>
<p>The Company's retention or purchase of subordinate MBS exposes PMT to the credit risk in the underlying loans because the Company's investments are among the first beneficial interests to absorb credit losses on those assets. The Company's exposure to losses from its investments in subordinate MBS is limited to its recorded investment in such securities.</p>
<p>The Company has concluded that the trusts holding the assets underlying these transactions are VIEs. The Company also has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of certain of the VIEs as it has the power, through PLS, in its role as the servicer or sub-servicer of the underlying loans, to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the trusts' economic performance and, as a holder of subordinate securities, that PMT is exposed to losses that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Therefore, PMT consolidates those VIEs.</p>
<p>The Company recognizes the interest income earned on the loans owned by the VIEs and the interest expense attributable to the asset-backed securities issued to nonaffiliates by its consolidated VIEs on its consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of the Company's investment in subordinate MBS backed by assets held in consolidated VIEs:</p>

<h2>Financing of Mortgage Servicing Assets</h2>
<p>The Company entered into a securitization transaction in which VIEs issued variable funding notes, term notes and term loans backed by beneficial interests in Fannie Mae MSRs. The Company acts as guarantor of the variable funding notes, term notes and term loans. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because, as the holder of the variable funding notes and issuer of performance guarantees, it holds the variable interests in the VIEs. Therefore, the Company consolidates the VIEs.</p>
<p>For financial reporting purposes, the MSRs financed by the consolidated VIEs are included in Mortgage servicing rights at fair value, the variable funding notes sold under agreements to repurchase are included in Assets sold under agreements to repurchase and the term notes and term loans are included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The financing is described in Note 15 Long Term Debt .</p>
<h2>Note 7- Fair Value</h2>
<p>The Company's consolidated financial statements include assets and liabilities that are measured at or based on their fair values. Measurement at or based on fair value may be on a recurring or nonrecurring basis depending on the accounting principles applicable to the specific asset or liability and whether the Company has elected to carry the item at its fair value as discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>The Company groups its assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>·Level 2-Prices determined or determinable using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>·Level 3-Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where significant observable inputs are unavailable, unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, and are based on the best information available in the circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result of the difficulty in observing certain significant valuation inputs affecting "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, the Company is required to make judgments regarding these items' fair values. Different persons in possession of the same facts may reasonably arrive at different conclusions as to the inputs to be applied in valuing these assets and liabilities and their fair values. Such differences may result in significantly different fair value measurements. Likewise, due to the general illiquidity of some of these assets and liabilities, subsequent transactions may be at values significantly different from those reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company reclassifies its assets and liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy when the inputs required to establish fair value at a level of the fair value hierarchy are no longer readily available, requiring the use of lower-level inputs, or when the inputs required to establish fair value at a higher level of the hierarchy become available.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Accounting Elections</h2>
<p>The Company identified all of PMT's non-cash financial assets and MSRs to be accounted for at fair value. The Company has elected to account for these assets at fair value so such changes in fair value will be reflected in income as they occur and more timely reflect the results of the Company's performance.</p>
<p>The Company has also identified its Asset-backed financings at fair value and Interest-only security payable at fair value to be accounted for at fair value to reflect the generally offsetting changes in fair value of these borrowings to changes in fair value of the assets at fair value collateralizing these financings. For other borrowings, the Company has determined that historical cost accounting is more appropriate because under historical cost accounting debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the debt facility, thereby matching the debt issuance costs to the periods benefiting from the availability of the debt.</p>

<p>The Company remeasures its REO based on fair value when it evaluates the REO properties for impairment. The Company evaluates its REO for impairment with reference to the respective properties' fair values less costs to sell. REO may be revalued after acquisition due to the Company receiving greater access to the property, the property being held for an extended period or receiving indications that the property's fair value may not be supported by developing market conditions. Any subsequent change in fair value to a level that is less than or equal to the property's cost is recognized in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the Company's consolidated statements of income.</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Amortized Cost</h2>
<p>Most of the Company's borrowings are carried at amortized cost. The Company's Assets sold under agreements to repurchase , Mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements, Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and the Exchangeable Notes, defined in Note 15 - LongTerm Debt , are classified as "Level 3" fair value liabilities due to the Company's reliance on unobservable inputs to estimate these instruments' fair values. The Company classifies the 2028 Senior Notes, defined in Note 15 - Long-Term Debt , as "Level 2" fair value liabilities.</p>
<p>The Company has concluded that the fair values of these borrowings other than term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets and the Unsecured senior notes approximate the agreements' carrying values due to the borrowing agreements' variable interest rates and short maturities.</p>
<p>The Company estimates the fair values of the term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by credit risk transfer and mortgage servicing assets using indications of fair value provided by nonaffiliate brokers for the term notes and internal estimates of fair value for the term loans, and uses pricing services for estimates of fair value of its Unsecured senior notes. The fair values and carrying values of these liabilities are summarized below:</p>

<h2>Valuation Governance</h2>
<p>Most of the Company's assets, its Asset-backed financings at fair value, Interest-only security payable at fair value and Derivative and credit risk transfer strip liabilities at fair value are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. A substantial portion of these items are "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities which require the use of unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability and are based on the best information available under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty in estimating the fair values of "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, the Company has assigned responsibility for estimating the fair values of these assets and liabilities to specialized staff within PFSI's capital markets group and subjects the valuation process to significant senior management oversight.</p>
<p>With respect to "Level 3" valuations other than IRLCs, the capital markets valuation staff reports to PFSI's senior management valuation committee, which oversees the valuations. The capital markets valuation staff monitors the models used for valuation of the Company's "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities other than IRLCs, including the models' performance versus actual results, and</p>
<p>reports those results to PFSI's senior management valuation committee. PFSI's senior management valuation committee includes the Company's chief financial and investment officers as well as other senior members of PFSI's finance, risk management and capital markets staffs.</p>
<p>The capital markets valuation staff is responsible for reporting to PFSI's senior management valuation committee on the changes in the valuation of the nonIRLC "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities, including major factors affecting the valuation and any changes in model methods and inputs. To assess the reasonableness of its valuations, the capital markets valuation staff presents an analysis of the effect on the valuation of changes to the significant inputs to the models and, for MSRs, comparisons of its estimates of fair value and key inputs to those procured from nonaffiliate brokers and published surveys.</p>
<p>The fair values of the Company's IRLCs are developed by PFSI's capital markets risk management staff and are reviewed by its capital markets operations staff.</p>
<h2>Valuation Techniques and Inputs</h2>
<p>The following is a description of the techniques and inputs used in estimating the fair values of "Level 2" and "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities:</p>
<h2>Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2>
<p>The Company's categorization of its current holdings of MBS is based on whether the respective security is an IO security:</p>
<p>·The Company categorizes the majority of its current holdings of MBS as "Level 2" fair value assets. Fair value of these securities is established based on quoted market prices for the Company's MBS holdings or similar securities.</p>
<p>·The Company categorizes its current holdings of IO securities as "Level 3" fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair values of its IO securities.</p>
<p>The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of IO securities include discount rate (pricing spread) and prepayment speed. Significant changes to those inputs in isolation may result in significant changes in the IO securities' fair value measurements. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related.</p>
<p>Following are the key inputs used in determining the fair value of IO securities:</p>

<p>Changes in the fair value of MBS are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income.</p>
<h2>Loans</h2>
<p>Fair value of loans is estimated based on whether the loans are saleable into active markets:</p>
<p>·Loans that are saleable into active markets, comprised of most of the Company's loans acquired for sale at fair value and all of the loans at fair value held in VIEs, are categorized as "Level 2" fair value assets:</p>
<p>·For loans acquired for sale, the fair values are established using the loans' contracted selling prices, quoted market prices or market price equivalents.</p>
<ul>
<li>·For the loans at fair value held in VIEs, the quoted indications of fair value of all of the individual securities issued by the securitization trusts are used to derive fair values for the loans. The Company obtains indications of fair value from nonaffiliate brokers based on comparable securities and validates the brokers' indications of fair value using pricing models and inputs the Company believes are similar to the pricing models and inputs used by other market participants. The Company adjusts the fair values received from brokers to include the fair value of MSRs attributable to the loans included in the VIEs.</li>
<li>·Loans that are not saleable into active markets, comprised of previously sold loans that the Company repurchased pursuant to the representation and warranties it provided to the purchaser and distressed loans, are categorized as "Level 3" fair value assets:</li>
<li>·Fair values for loans acquired for sale categorized as "Level 3" assets are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach or the loans' contracted selling prices when applicable. Inputs to the discounted cash flow model include current interest rates, payment statuses, property types, discount rates and forecasts of future interest rates, home prices, prepayment speeds, default speeds and loss severities.</li>
<li>·Distressed loans' fair values are estimated based on the expected resolution from the individual asset's disposition strategy. When a cash flow projection is used to estimate fair values, those cash flows are discounted at annual rates up to 20%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Derivative and Credit Risk Transfer Strip Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<h2>CRT Derivatives</h2>
<p>The Company categorizes CRT derivatives as "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities. The fair values of CRT derivatives are based on indications of fair value provided to the Company by nonaffiliate brokers for the certificates representing the beneficial interests in the trusts holding the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors , the recourse obligations and the IO ownership interests. Together, the recourse obligation and the IO ownership interest comprise the CRT derivative. Fair values of the CRT derivatives are derived by deducting the balance of the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors from the fair values of the certificates.</p>
<p>The Company assesses the fair values it receives from nonaffiliate brokers using the discounted cash flow approach. The significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in its review and approval of the valuation of CRT derivatives are the discount rates, voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds and the remaining loss expectations of the reference loans. Changes in fair value of CRT derivatives are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the Company's review and approval of broker-provided fair values for CRT derivatives:</p>

<h2>Interest Rate Lock Commitments</h2>
<p>The Company categorizes IRLCs as "Level 3" fair value assets and liabilities. The Company estimates the fair values of IRLCs based on quoted Agency MBS prices, the probability that the loans will be purchased under the commitments (the "pull-through rate") and the Company's estimate of the fair values of the MSRs it expects to receive upon sale of the loans.</p>
<p>The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's IRLCs are the pull-through rates and the estimated MSRs attributed to the mortgage loans subject to the commitments. Significant changes in the pull-through rates or the MSR components of the IRLCs, in isolation, may result in a significant change in the IRLCs' fair values. The financial effects of changes in these inputs are generally inversely correlated as increasing interest rates have a positive effect on the fair value of the MSR component of an IRLC's fair value, but also increase the pull-through rate for the loan principal and interest payment cash flow component that has decreased in fair value. Changes in fair value of IRLCs are included in Net gains on loans acquired for sale in the consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of IRLCs:</p>

<h2>Hedging Derivatives</h2>
<p>Fair values of derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges are categorized by the Company as "Level 1" fair value assets and liabilities. Fair values of derivative financial instruments based on observable interest rates, volatilities and prices in the MBS or other markets are categorized by the Company as "Level 2" fair value assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair values of hedging derivatives are included in Net loan servicing fees - from nonaffiliates - Mortgage servicing rights hedging results, Net gains on loans acquired for sale , or Net (losses) gains on investments and financings, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of income.</p>
<h2>Credit Risk Transfer Strips</h2>
<p>The Company categorizes CRT strips as "Level 3" fair value liabilities. The fair values of CRT strips are based on indications of fair value provided to the Company by nonaffiliate brokers for the securities representing the beneficial interests in the trusts holding the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors, the IO ownership interests and the recourse obligations. Together, the IO ownership interest and the recourse obligation comprise the CRT strip.</p>
<p>Fair values of the CRT strips are derived by deducting the balance of the Deposits securing credit risk transfer arrangements pledged to creditors from the indications of fair value of the securities provided by the nonaffiliate brokers.</p>
<p>The Company assesses the indications of fair value it receives from nonaffiliate brokers using the discounted cash flow approach. The significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in its review and approval of the valuation of the CRT strips are the discount rates, voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds and the remaining loss expectations of the reference loans. Changes in fair value of CRT strips are included in Net (losses) gains on investments and financings in the consolidated statements of income .</p>
<p>Following is a quantitative summary of key unobservable inputs used in the Company's review and approval of the broker-provided fair values of the CRT strip liabilities:</p>

<h2>Mortgage Servicing Rights</h2>
<p>The Company categorizes MSRs as "Level 3" fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair values of MSRs. The fair values of MSRs are derived from the net positive cash flows associated with the servicing agreements. The Company receives a servicing fee based on the remaining UPB of the loans subject to the servicing agreements and generally has the right to receive other remuneration including various mortgagor-contracted fees such as late charges and collateral reconveyance charges, and is generally entitled to retain any placement fees earned on certain custodial funds held pending remittance of mortgagor principal, interest, tax and insurance payments.</p>
<p>The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include the applicable pricing spreads, the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, and the annual per-loan costs to service the loans, all of which are unobservable. Significant changes to any of those inputs in isolation could result in significant changes in the MSR fair value measurements. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are included in Net loan servicing fees - From nonaffiliates - Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights in the consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>MSRs are generally subject to loss in fair value when prepayment speed expectations and experience increase, when returns required by market participants (pricing spreads) increase, or when annual per-loan costs of servicing increase. Reductions in the fair value of MSRs affect income primarily through recognition of the change in fair value.</p>
<p>Following are the key inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs at the time of initial recognition:</p>

<p>(2)The Company uses a pricing spread over a derived Treasury yield curve for the purpose of discounting cash flows relating to MSRs.</p>
<p>(3)These sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed as of a particular date; only account for the estimated effect of the movements in the indicated inputs; do not incorporate changes in those inputs in relation to other inputs; are subject to the accuracy of the models and inputs used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect the Company's overall financial performance in such events, including operational adjustments to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, these analyses should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.</p>
<p>(4)Prepayment speed is measured using life total CPR, which includes both voluntary and involuntary prepayments. Equivalent average life is provided as supplementary information.</p>
<h2>Real Estate Acquired in Settlement of Loans</h2>
<p>REO is measured based on its fair value on a nonrecurring basis and is categorized as a "Level 3" fair value asset. Fair value of REO is established by using a current estimate of fair value from either a broker's price opinion, a full appraisal, or the price given in a pending contract of sale.</p>
<p>REO fair values are reviewed by PLS staff appraisers when the Company obtains multiple indications of fair value and there is a significant difference between the indications of fair value. PLS staff appraisers will attempt to resolve the difference between the indications of fair value. In circumstances where the staff appraisers are not able to generate adequate data to support a fair value conclusion, the staff appraisers obtain an additional appraisal to determine fair value. Recognized changes in the fair value of REO are included in Results of real estate acquired in settlement of loans in the consolidated statements of income.</p>

<h2>Derivative Activities</h2>
<p>The Company holds and issues derivative financial instruments in connection with its operating, investing and financing activities. Derivative financial instruments are created as a result of certain of the Company's operations and the Company also enters into derivative transactions as part of its interest rate risk management activities.</p>
<p>Derivative financial instruments created as a result of the Company's operations include:</p>
<p>·IRLCs that are created when the Company commits to purchase loans acquired for sale; and</p>
<ul>
<li>·CRT Agreements whereby the Company retained recourse obligations relating to certain loans it sold into Fannie Mae guaranteed securitizations as part of the retention of IO ownership interests in such loans.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company engages in interest rate risk management activities in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair values of certain of its assets and liabilities. The Company bears price risk related to its mortgage production, servicing assets and MBS financing activities due to changes in market interest rates as discussed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>·The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates increase, because market interest rate increases generally cause the fair values of MBS, IRLCs and loans acquired for sale to decrease.</li>
<li>·The Company is exposed to losses if market mortgage interest rates decrease, because market interest rate decreases generally encourage increased mortgage refinancing activities, which causes the fair values of MSRs to decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>To manage the price risk resulting from these interest rate risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments with the intention of moderating the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the fair values of the Company's MBS, inventory of loans acquired for sale, IRLCs and MSRs. The Company does not designate and qualify any of its derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting.</p>
<p>Cash flows from derivative financial instruments relating to hedging of IRLCs and loans acquired for sale are included in Cash flows from operating activities in Sale to nonaffiliates and repayment of loans acquired for sale at fair value. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments relating to hedging of MSRs are included in Cash flows from investing activities .</p>

<h2>Mortgage Loan Participation Purchase and Sale Agreement</h2>
<p>One of the borrowing facilities secured by loans acquired for sale is in the form of a mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreement. Participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a pool of loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, are sold to the lender pending the securitization of such loans and the sale of the resulting security. The commitment between the Company and a nonaffiliate to sell such security is also assigned to the lender at the time a participation certificate is sold.</p>
<p>The purchase price paid by the lender for each participation certificate is based on the trade price of the security, plus an amount of interest expected to accrue on the security to its anticipated delivery date, minus a present value adjustment, any related hedging costs and a holdback amount. The holdback amount is based on a percentage of the purchase price and is not required to be paid to the Company until the settlement of the security and its delivery to the lender.</p>
<p>The mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreement is summarized below:</p>

<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, income, or cash flows of the Company.</p>
<h2>Litigation</h2>
<p>On June 14, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company's Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares (each, as defined hereafter) filed a complaint in a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Roberto Verthelyi v. PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust and PNMAC Capital Management, LLC, Case No. 2:24-cv-05028 (the "Verthelyi Action"). The Verthelyi Action alleges, among other things, that the Company (and its external investment advisor, PCM), committed unlawful and unfair acts in violation of California's Unfair Competition Law by replacing its floating three-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") dividend rate for the Series A and Series B Preferred Shares with a fixed rate, in violation of the LIBOR Act, 12 U.S.C. § 5801 et seq., and the LIBOR Rule, 12 C.F.R. § 253 et seq.</p>
<p>The Verthelyi Action seeks injunctive relief requiring the Company to implement SOFR as a replacement to the three-month LIBOR rate and damages for the putative class in the form of restitution, interest, disgorgement and other relief. The Company believes it has interpreted the Articles Supplementary to its Series A and Series B Preferred Shares consistent with their terms and, more specifically, the interest rate fallback provisions contained therein, as applied under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR rules, and that the Verthelyi Action is without merit. Accordingly, while no assurance can be provided as to the ultimate outcome of this claim, the Company and PCM plan to vigorously defend the matter. Pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2020, by and between the Company and PCM, the Company has assumed the defense of PCM in the Verthelyi Action.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Articles Supplementary for each of the Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series A Preferred Shares") and the Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), and disregarding the polling provisions contained in the Articles Supplementary for the Series A Preferred Shares and the Series B Preferred Shares that are deemed null and void in accordance with Federal Reserve rules, the applicable dividend rate for dividend periods from and after March 15, 2024, in the case of the Series A Preferred Shares, or June 15, 2024, in the case of the Series B Preferred Shares, are being calculated at the dividend rate in effect for the immediately preceding dividend period. As a result, the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares will continue to accumulate dividends from and after March 15, 2024, in the case of the Series A Preferred Shares, or June 15, 2024, in the case of the Series B Preferred Shares, at their fixed rate then in effect and will not transition to floating reference rates.</p>
<p>The Series A Preferred Shares became redeemable on March 15, 2024 and the Series B Preferred Shares become redeemable on June 15, 2024. The Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares will not be redeemable before August 24, 2026, except in connection with the Company's qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or upon the occurrence of a change of control. On or after the date the preferred shares become redeemable, or 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurs, the Company may, at its option, redeem any or all of the preferred shares at $25.00 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date. No preferred shares were redeemed during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The preferred shares have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted into Common Shares in connection with a change of control by the holders of the Preferred Shares.</p>

<h2>Note 22-Share-Based Compensation</h2>
<p>The Company has an equity incentive plan, adopted in 2019, that provides for the issuance of equity based awards based on PMT's Common Shares that may be made by the Company to its officers and trustees, and the members, officers, trustees, directors and employees of PCM, PFSI, or their affiliates and to PCM, PFSI and other entities that provide services to PMT and the employees of such other entities.</p>
<p>The equity incentive plan is administered by the Company's compensation committee, pursuant to authority delegated by PMT's board of trustees, which has the authority to make awards to the eligible participants referenced above, and to determine what form the awards will take, and the terms and conditions of the awards.</p>
<p>The equity incentive plan allows for the grant of restricted and performance-based share and unit awards.</p>
<p>The shares underlying award grants will again be available for award under the equity incentive plan if:</p>
<ul>
<li>·any shares subject to an award granted under the equity incentive plan are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or surrendered;</li>
<li>·an award terminates or expires without a distribution of shares to the participant; or</li>
<li>·shares are surrendered or withheld by PMT as payment of either the exercise price of an award and/or withholding taxes for an award.</li>
</ul>
<p>Restricted share units have been awarded to trustees and officers of the Company and to other employees of PFSI and its subsidiaries at no cost to the grantees. Such awards generally vest over a one- to three-year period.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation activity:</p>

<h2>Note 23-Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company's effective tax rate was 11.1% and (19.8)% with consolidated pretax income of $28.6 million and $61.0 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") recognized a tax expense of</p>
<p>$3.0 million on pretax income of $9.9 million and a tax benefit of $12.0 million on a pretax loss of $51.0 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024. For the same periods in 2023, the TRS recognized a tax expense of $21.2 million on pretax income of $77.9 million and a tax benefit of $0.6 million on a pretax loss of $12.2 million. The Company's reported consolidated pretax income was $46.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The primary difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction.</p>
<p>The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of June 30, 2024, the valuation allowance remains zero. The conclusion was primarily based on the fact that the TRS has reported cumulative GAAP income over the last three-year period ending June 30, 2024. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income.</p>
<p>In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a 20% deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.</p>
<h2>Note 24-Earnings Per Common Share</h2>
<p>The Company determines earnings per share using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to Common Shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The Company's participating securities are grants of restricted share units that entitle the recipients to receive dividend equivalents during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Shares.</p>
<p>Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders (net income reduced by preferred dividends and income attributable to the participating securities) by the weighted average Common Shares outstanding during the quarter.</p>
<p>Diluted earnings per share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of Common Shares and dilutive securities. The Company's potentially dilutive securities are share-based compensation awards and the Exchangeable Notes. The number of dilutive securities included in diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for share-based compensation awards and the if-converted method for the Exchangeable Notes.</p>
<p>As discussed in Note 15- Long-Term Debt, effective June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a supplemental indenture affecting the terms of conversion of the 2024 Exchangeable Notes and the 2026 Exchangeable Notes. As a result of entering into the supplemental indenture, beginning with the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2024, the number of shares included in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding will represent the number of shares required to settle the obligation in excess of the unpaid balance of the notes being exchanged.</p>

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Report to the words "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to PMT and its consolidated subsidiaries.</p>
<h2>Our Company</h2>
<p>We are a specialty finance company that invests in mortgage-related assets. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. A significant portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage-related assets that we have created through our correspondent production activities, including mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), subordinate mortgage-backed securities ("MBS"), and credit risk transfer ("CRT") arrangements, which absorb credit losses on certain of the loans we have sold. We also invest in Agency and senior nonAgency MBS, subordinate credit-linked MBS and interest-only ("IO") and principal-only ("PO") stripped MBS. We have also historically invested in distressed mortgage assets (distressed loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans ("REO")), which we have substantially liquidated.</p>
<p>We are externally managed by PNMAC Capital Management, LLC ("PCM"), an investment adviser that specializes in and focuses on U.S. mortgage assets. Our loans and MSRs are serviced by PennyMac Loan Services, LLC ("PLS"). PCM and PLS are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ("PFSI"), a publicly-traded mortgage banking and investment management company separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>We operate our business in four segments: Credit sensitive strategies, Interest rate sensitive strategies, Correspondent production and our Corporate operations, as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>·The credit sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in CRT arrangements referencing loans from our own correspondent production and subordinate MBS.</li>
<li>·The interest rate sensitive strategies segment represents our investments in MSRs, Agency and senior non-Agency MBS and the related interest rate hedging activities.</li>
<li>·The correspondent production segment represents our operations aimed at serving as an intermediary between lenders and the capital markets by purchasing, pooling and reselling newly originated prime credit quality loans either directly or in the form of MBS, using the services of PCM and PLS.</li>
<li>We primarily sell the loans we acquire through our correspondent production activities to government-sponsored entities ("GSEs") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or to PLS for sale into securitizations guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), or the GSEs. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are each referred to as an "Agency" and, collectively, as the "Agencies."</li>
</ul>
<p>·The corporate segment includes management fees, corporate expense amounts and certain interest income and expense.</p>
<h2>Our Investment Activities</h2>
<h2>Credit Sensitive Investments</h2>
<h2>CRT Arrangements</h2>
<p>We held net CRT-related investments (comprised of deposits securing CRT arrangements, CRT derivatives, CRT strips and an interest-only security payable) totaling approximately $1.1 billion at June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Subordinate Credit-Linked Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2>
<p>Subordinate credit-linked MBS provide us with a higher yield than senior securities. However, we retain credit risk in the subordinate credit-linked MBS since they are the first securities to absorb credit losses relating to the underlying loans. We sold approximately $111.0 million of our holdings of subordinate credit-linked MBS during the six months ended June 30, 2024. We held subordinate credit-linked MBS with fair values totaling approximately $196.8 million at June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>As the result of the Company's consolidation of the variable interest entities that issued the subordinate MBS as described in Note 6 Variable Interest Entities -Subordinate Mortgage-Backed Securities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report, we include loans underlying these and similar transactions with unpaid principal balances ("UPBs") totaling approximately $1.7 billion on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Sensitive Investments</h2>
<p>Our interest rate sensitive investments include:</p>
<p>·Mortgage servicing rights. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we received approximately $71.9 million of MSRs as proceeds from sales of loans acquired for sale. We held approximately $3.9 billion of MSRs at fair value at June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>·REIT-eligible Agency, senior non-Agency, IO and PO stripped MBS. We purchased approximately $399.5 million of Agency PO stripped MBS and sold $833.4 million of fixed-rate pass-through securities during the six months ended June 30, 2024. We held Agency fixed-rate pass-through, senior non-Agency, IO stripped and PO stripped MBS with fair values totaling approximately $3.9 billion at June 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Correspondent Production</h2>
<p>Our correspondent production activities involve the acquisition and sale of newly originated prime credit quality residential loans. Correspondent production has served as the source of our investments in MSRs, private label non-Agency securitizations and CRT arrangements. Our correspondent production and resulting investment activity are summarized below:</p>

<p>During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we purchased newly originated prime credit quality residential loans with fair values totaling $41.3 billion as compared to $41.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, in our correspondent production business. To the extent that we purchase loans that are insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or U.S. Department of Agriculture, we and PLS have agreed that PLS will fulfill and purchase such loans, as PLS is a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and we are not. This arrangement has enabled us to compete with other correspondent aggregators that purchase both government and conventional loans. We may also sell conventional loans that we purchase to PLS subject to our and PLS's mutual agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we sold $18.4 billion and $18.2 billion UPB of government guaranteed or insured loans and conventional loans, respectively, to PLS in order to optimize our use and allocation of capital.</p>
<p>Our purchase volume included $37.2 billion and $32.1 billion of loans we sold to PLS during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We receive a sourcing fee from PLS based on the UPB of each loan that we sell to PLS under such arrangement, and earn interest income on the loan for the period we hold it before the sale to PLS. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we received sourcing fees totaling $3.7 million, relating to $36.6 billion, in UPB of loans that we sold to PLS.</p>
<h2>Taxation</h2>
<p>We believe that we qualify to be taxed as a REIT and as such will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our income that is distributed to shareholders as long as we meet applicable REIT asset, income and share ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our profits will be subject to income taxes and we may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the four tax years following the year we lose our REIT qualification.</p>
<p>A portion of our activities, including our correspondent production business, is conducted in our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, we make a provision for income taxes with respect to the operations of our TRS. We expect that the effective rate for the provision for income taxes may be volatile in future periods. Our goal is to manage the business to take full advantage of the tax benefits afforded to us as a REIT.</p>
<p>We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, taxable loss carryback availability, expectations of sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of taxable income in recent years, the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if required. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related deferred tax assets become deductible.</p>
<h2>Non-Cash Investment Income</h2>
<p>A substantial portion of our net investment income is comprised of non-cash items, including fair value adjustments and recognition of the fair value of assets created and liabilities incurred in loan sales transactions. Because we have elected, or are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), to record certain of our financial assets (comprised of MBS, loans acquired for sale at fair value, loans at fair value and CRT strips), our derivatives, our MSRs, and our asset-backed financings and interest-only security payable at fair value, a substantial portion of the income or loss we record with respect to such assets and liabilities results from non-cash changes in fair value.</p>
<p>The amounts of net non-cash investment income items included in net investment income are as follows:</p>

<h2>Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>Business Trends</h2>
<p>Due to ongoing inflationary pressures, over the last several quarters, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the federal funds rate at its highest level since 2007 and has continued to reduce the federal government's overall holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Elevated interest rates are expected to constrain growth in the size of the mortgage origination market from $1.5 trillion in 2023 to an estimated $1.7 trillion in 2024 according to mortgage lending industry economists.</p>
<p>The limited size of the mortgage origination market and sustained interest rates at higher levels continue to impact our mortgage production activities. Higher interest rates have also increased the costs of floating rate borrowings, increased interest income from placement fees we receive relating to custodial funds that we manage on deposits and loans held for sale and reduced prepayment speeds in our mortgage servicing portfolio as compared to the same time period in the prior year. We have also continued our sales of conventional loans to PLS during the six months ended June 30, 2024, and we intend to continue to sell a portion of our conventional loans to PLS throughout the remainder of 2024 at a reduce rate to optimize our use and allocation of capital.</p>
<p>Elevated interest rates may also lead to a reduction in economic activity and slowing home price growth or depreciation, which could lead to increasing mortgage delinquencies or defaults and increased losses. If these effects are realized, they could negatively affect the performance of our credit-sensitive assets such as our CRT arrangements or subordinate credit-linked notes and increase losses from our representations and warranties. However, many of the loans underlying our assets have favorable credit characteristics including low loan-to-value ratios, which are likely to help moderate the negative effects of credit performance in an economic downturn.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of our key performance measures:</p>

<p>(1)Includes net gains on sales of loans and loan origination fees.</p>
<p>Our consolidated net income increased by $810,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023 reflecting decreased losses on MBS and a reduced provision for income taxes offset by reduced CRT-related investment gains:</p>
<p>The decrease in the quarterly pretax results is summarized below:</p>

<p>·Our interest rate sensitive strategies segment recognized a $35.2 million decrease in valuation losses on MBS and hedging derivatives caused by a smaller increase in interest rates over the quarter and a $9.1 million decrease in net interest expense in our interest rate sensitive strategies segment, offset by a $12.3 million decrease in net servicing fees resulting from increased net MSR valuation losses compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>·Our correspondent production segment recognized a $7.7 million increase in our gains on sale of loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, reflecting a reduction of our liability for representations and warranties due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans, and improved gain on sale margins and increased gain on sale margins for mortgage loans partially offset by reduced volume of sales to nonaffiliates.</p>
<p>Our consolidated net income decreased $12.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 reflecting losses on MBS and reduced CRT-related investment gains, partially offset by increased net servicing fees, net gains on sales of loans and benefit from income taxes:</p>

<p>Loan servicing fees relate to our MSRs which are primarily related to servicing we provide for loans included in Agency securitizations. These fees are contractually established at an annualized percentage of the UPB of the loans serviced and we collect these fees from borrower payments. Other loan servicing fees are comprised primarily of borrower-contracted fees, such as late charges</p>
<p>and reconveyance fees, and incentive fees received form the Agencies for loss mitigation activities as well as fees charged to correspondent lenders for loans repaid by the borrower shortly after purchase.</p>
<p>The change in contractually-specified fees during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is due primarily to a slight reduction in our MSR servicing portfolio, reflecting the shift of a portion of our loan sales from third party sales with servicing rights retained to sales to PLS which include the transfer of servicing rights to PLS.</p>
<p>We have elected to carry our servicing assets at fair value. Changes in fair value have two components: changes due to realization of the contractual servicing fees and changes due to changes in inputs used to estimate fair value. We endeavor to moderate the effects of changes in fair value attributable to changes in fair value inputs (market conditions) primarily by entering into derivatives transactions.</p>
<p>Changes in fair value of MSRs and hedging results are summarized below:</p>

<p>Changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs used in our valuation model during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, reflect the effects of expectations for slower future prepayments of the underlying loans and higher earnings on custodial balances as a result of interest rates increasing.</p>
<p>The decrease in loan recapture income from PFSI reflects the decrease in refinancing activity in our MSR portfolio during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. We have an agreement with PFSI that requires that when PFSI refinances a loan for which we held the MSRs, we receive a recapture fee. The MSR recapture agreement is summarized in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties - Operating Activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.</p>
<p>Hedging results reflect valuation losses in hedges against interest rates during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, which is attributable to interest rates increasing as well as the effects of interest rate volatility and elevated hedge costs on the fair value of the hedging instruments.</p>
<p>Changes in realization of cash flows are influenced by changes in the level of servicing assets and liabilities and changes in estimates of remaining cash flows to be realized.</p>

<p>The changes in gain on loans acquired for sale during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, reflect the effect of a reduction in our liability for representations and warranties and increased gain on sale margins for mortgage loans partially offset by reduced volume of sales to nonaffiliates.</p>
<h2>Non-cash elements of gain on sale of loans:</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Lock Commitments</h2>
<p>Our Net gains on loans acquired for sale include our estimates of gains or losses we expect to realize upon the sale of mortgage loans we have committed to purchase but have not yet purchased or sold. Therefore, we recognize a substantial portion of our net gains before we purchase the loans. These gains are reflected on our balance sheet as IRLC derivative assets and liabilities. We adjust the fair value of our IRLCs as the loan acquisition process progresses until we complete the acquisition or the commitment is canceled. Such adjustments are included in our Net gains on loans acquired for sale . The fair values of our IRLCs becomes part of the carrying value of our loans when we complete the purchase of the loans. The methods and key inputs we use to measure the fair value of IRLCs are summarized in Note 7 - Fair value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.</p>
<p>The MSRs and liability for representations and warranties we recognize represent our estimate of the fair value of future benefits and costs we will realize for years in the future. These estimates change as circumstances change, and changes in these estimates are recognized in our results of operations in subsequent periods. Subsequent changes in the fair value of our MSRs significantly affect our income.</p>
<h2>Mortgage Servicing Rights</h2>
<p>The methods we use to measure and update the measurements of our MSRs as well as the effect of changes in valuation inputs on MSR fair value are detailed in Note 7 - Fair value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.</p>
<h2>Liability for Losses Under Representations and Warranties</h2>
<p>We recognize a liability for losses we expect to incur relating to the representations and warranties we provide to purchasers in our loan sales transactions. The representations and warranties require adherence to purchaser and insurer origination and underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to the validity of the lien securing the loan, property eligibility, borrower credit, income and asset requirements, and compliance with applicable federal, state and local law.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer against credit losses attributable to the loans with indemnified defects. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit loss on the loans. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent sellers that, in turn, had sold such loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. In such event, we have the right to seek a recovery of those repurchase losses from that correspondent seller.</p>
<p>We recorded a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties relating to current loan sales of $204,000 and $458,000, respectively, for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024 and $738,000 and $1.7 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the provision relating to current loan sales reflects the decrease of our loan sales volume to nonaffiliates and reduced default and loss-given default assumptions.</p>

</table>
<p>The losses on representations and warranties we have recorded to date have been moderated by our ability to recover most of the losses inherent in the repurchased loans from the correspondent sellers. As the outstanding balance of loans we purchase and sell subject to representations and warranties increases, as the loans outstanding season, as our investors' and guarantors' loss mitigation strategies change and as our correspondent sellers' ability and willingness to repurchase loans change, we expect that the level of repurchase activity and associated losses may increase.</p>
<p>The method we use to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of our estimates of future defaults, loan repurchase rates, severity of loss in the event of default and the probability of reimbursement by the correspondent loan sellers. We establish a liability at our estimate of its fair value at the time loans are sold and review our liability estimate on a periodic basis and adjust the liability for estimated losses in excess of the recorded liability.</p>
<p>The amount of the liability for representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable judgment. The level of loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, investor loss mitigation strategies, our ability to recover any losses inherent in the repurchased loan from the correspondent seller and other external conditions that change over the lives of the underlying loans. We may be required to incur losses related to such representations and warranties for several periods after the loans are sold or liquidated.</p>
<p>We record adjustments to our liability for losses on representations and warranties as economic fundamentals change, as investor and Agency evaluations of their loss mitigation strategies (including claims under representations and warranties) change and as economic conditions affect our correspondent sellers' ability or willingness to fulfill their recourse obligations to us. Such adjustments may be material to our financial position and income in future periods.</p>
<p>Adjustments to our liability for representations and warranties are included as a component of our Net gains on loans acquired for sale at fair value . We recorded $6.5 million and $13.4 million reduction in liability for representations and warranties during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans. We recorded $2.9 million and $3.6 million reductions in the liability for representations and warranties during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, due to the effects of certain loans reaching specified performance histories identified by the Agencies as sufficient to limit repurchase claims relating to such loans.</p>

<p>The decrease in net gains on investments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to losses from our investments in MBS as interest rates increased and reduced gains in our CRT arrangements as spreads did not tighten to the same degree.</p>
<h2>Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2>
<p>During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized net valuation losses of $34.9 million and $73.1 million, respectively, as compared to net valuation losses of $61.6 million and net valuation gains of $16.6 million for the same periods in 2023.</p>
<p>The reduced losses recognized during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 reflect mixed interest rate performance at the end of the quarter as compared to an increase in interest rates during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The losses recognized during the six month ended June 30, 2024, reflect more significant increases in interest rates and mortgage and credit spreads during the period as compared to the same period in 2023.</p>
<h2>Loans at Fair Value - Held in VIEs and Asset-backed Financings at Fair Value</h2>
<p>Loans at fair value held in VIEs and Asset-backed financings at fair value recorded combined net valuation loss of $1.4 million and valuation gain of $4.8 million during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a net valuation loss of $459,000 and valuation gain of $398,000 during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023. The net loss during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, reflect the effect of interest rate performance during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The net gain during the six months ended June 30, 2024 reflect the gains on the asset-backed financing exceeding the losses on the underlying assets as the result of credit spreads tightening (a decrease in the interest rate premium demanded by investors for instruments over those that are considered "risk free"), on our net investments secured by jumbo loans and investment properties.</p>

<p>Management fees increased by $55,000 and decreased by $14,000 during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Management fees increased due to higher average shareholders' equity during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease reflects lower average shareholders' equity during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.</p>
<h2>Loan Fulfillment Fees</h2>
<p>Loan fulfillment fees represent fees we pay to PLS for the services it performs on our behalf in connection with our acquisition, packaging and sale of loans. Fulfillment fees decreased $1.0 million and $8.9 million during the quarter and six months ended</p>
<p>June 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in the volume of loans purchased for sale to nonaffiliates . Our loan fulfillment fee structure is described in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report .</p>
<h2>Loan Origination</h2>
<p>Loan origination expenses decreased $364,000 and $2.1 million, or 41% and 67%, during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily reflecting a decrease in the volume of our loans purchased for sale to nonaffiliates.</p>

<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>We have elected to treat PennyMac Corp. ("PMC"), as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). Income from a TRS is only included as a component of REIT taxable income to the extent that the TRS makes dividend distributions of income to us. A TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax. Accordingly, a provision for income taxes for PMC is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.</p>
<p>The Company's effective tax rate was 11.1% and (19.8)% with consolidated pretax income of $28.6 million and $61.0 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company's TRS recognized a tax expense of $3.0 million on pretax income of $9.9 million and tax benefit of $12.0 million on a pretax loss of $51.0 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024. For the same periods in 2023, the TRS recognized a tax expense of $21.2 million on pretax income of $77.9 million and a tax benefit of $0.6 million on a pretax loss of $12.2 million. The Company's reported consolidated pretax income was $46.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The primary difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is generally attributable to nontaxable REIT income resulting from the dividends paid deduction.</p>
<p>The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, as of June 30, 2024, the valuation allowance remains zero as a result of cumulative GAAP income at the TRS for the three-year period ended June 30, 2024. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods based on future income.</p>
<p>In general, cash dividends declared by the Company will be considered ordinary income to the shareholders for income tax purposes. Some portion of the dividends may be characterized as capital gain distributions or a return of capital. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (subject to certain limitations) provides a 20% deduction from taxable income for ordinary REIT dividends.</p>

<p>Our acquisitions during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were financed through the use of a combination of proceeds from borrowings and liquidations of existing investments. We continue to identify additional means of increasing our investment portfolio through cash flow from our business activities, existing investments, borrowings, and transactions that minimize current cash outlays. However, we expect that, over time, our ability to continue our investment portfolio growth will depend on our ability to raise additional equity capital.</p>

<p>Cash flows from loans acquired for sale primarily reflect changes in the level of inventory from the beginning to end of the periods presented. Our inventory of loans held for sale increased during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a decrease during the same period in 2023.</p>
<h2>Investing activities</h2>
<p>Net cash provided by our investing activities was $763.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in our investing activities of $132.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to our net sale of MBS.</p>
<h2>Financing activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in our financing activities was $815.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in our financing activities of $483.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This change primarily reflects the repayment of financing related to our net sale of MBS.</p>
<p>As discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources , our Manager continually evaluates and pursues additional sources of financing to provide us with future investing capacity. We do not raise equity or enter into borrowings for the purpose of financing the payment of dividends. We believe that our cash earnings are adequate to fund our operating expenses and dividend payment requirements. However, we manage our liquidity in the aggregate and are reinvesting our cash flows in new investments as well as using such cash to fund our dividend requirements.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including the purchase of loans from correspondent sellers, our operating expenses and, when applicable, retirement of, and margin calls relating to, our debt and derivatives positions), make investments as our Manager identifies them, pursue our share repurchase program and make distributions to our shareholders. We generally need to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our shareholders to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital to support our activities.</p>
<p>We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flows from our investment portfolio, including cash earnings on our investments, cash flows from business activities, liquidation of existing investments and proceeds from borrowings and/or additional equity offerings. When we finance a particular asset, the amount borrowed is less than the asset's fair value and we must provide the cash in the amount of such difference. Our ability to continue making investments is dependent on our ability to invest the cash representing such difference.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2024, the Company, PMT ISSUER TRUST-FMSR and PMT CO-ISSUER TRUST-FMSR (together, the "Issuer Trusts"), PMT and PennyMac Holdings, LLC ("PMH") entered into a Series 2024-VF1 Note with Goldman Sachs Bank, USA, as part of the structured finance transaction that PMC uses to finance Fannie Mae mortgage servicing rights and related excess servicing spread and servicing advance receivables. The initial two-year term of the Series 2024-VF1 Note is set to expire on March 15, 2026, at which point the Series 2024-VF1 Note amortizes over 12 months prior to termination.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2024, we issued in a private offering $247 million aggregate principal amount of CRT term notes that mature on March 29, 2027 at a rate of 3.35% over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.</p>
<p>On May 24, 2024 and June 4, 2024, PMC issued in a private offering $216.5 million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2029 (the "2029 Exchangeable Notes") that mature on June 1, 2029 at a rate of 8.500% per year. The 2029 Exchangeable Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PMT. Upon exchange, PMC will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, PMT's common shares of beneficial interest ("Common Shares"), or a combination thereof, at PMT's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged. The exchange rate initially equals 63.3332 Common Shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Exchangeable Notes.</p>
<p>On June 27, 2024, the Company, the Issuer Trusts, PMC and PMH issued an aggregate principal amount of $355 million in secured term notes (the "Series 2024FT1 Term Notes") as part of the structured finance transaction that PMC and PMH use to finance Fannie Mae mortgage servicing rights and related excess servicing spread and servicing advance receivables. The initial 3.5 year term of the Series 2024-FT1 Term Notes is set to mature on December 27, 2027, unless the Company exercises a six-month optional extension.</p>
<h2>Debt Financing</h2>
<p>Our current debt financing strategy is to finance our assets where we believe such borrowing is prudent, appropriate and available. We make collateralized borrowings in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase, loan participation purchase and sale agreements and notes payable, including secured term financing for our MSRs and our CRT arrangements that have allowed us to match the term of our borrowings more closely to the expected lives of the assets securing those borrowings. We have also borrowed money by issuing unsecured senior notes.</p>
<p>Our debt financing as of June 30, 2024 is summarized below:</p>

<h2>Sales of Assets Under Agreements to Repurchase</h2>

<p>The difference between the maximum and average daily amounts outstanding is primarily due to timing of loan purchases and sales in our correspondent production business. The total facility size of our Assets sold under agreements to repurchase was approximately $11.2 billion at June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Because a significant portion of our current debt facilities consists of short-term borrowings, we expect to either renew these facilities in advance of maturity in order to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital or otherwise allow ourselves sufficient time to replace any necessary financing.</p>
<p>As discussed above, all of our repurchase agreements, and mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements have short-term maturities:</p>
<ul>
<li>·The transactions relating to loans and REO under agreements to repurchase generally provide for terms of approximately one to two years;</li>
<li>·The transactions relating to loans under mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements provide for terms of approximately one year;</li>
<li>·The transactions relating to assets under notes payable provide for terms ranging from two to five years; and</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount at risk (the fair value of the assets pledged plus the related margin deposit, less the amount advanced by the counterparty and accrued interest) relating to our Assets sold under agreements to repurchase is summarized by counterparty below as of June 30, 2024:</p>

<h2>Unsecured Senior Notes</h2>
<p>In September 2023, we issued $53.5 million principal amount of our unsecured 8.50% senior notes due September 30, 2028 (the "2028 Senior Notes"). The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.50% per year payable quarterly.</p>
<p>On or after September 30, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Senior Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No "sinking fund" will be provided for the 2028 Senior Notes.</p>
<p>The 2028 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PMC, including the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 2028 Senior Notes, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise (the "PMC Guarantee"). PMC's operations and investing activities are centered in residential mortgage-related assets, including the creation of and investment in MSRs.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the PMC Guarantee, holders of the 2028 Senior Notes will not be required to exercise their remedies against us before they proceed directly against PMC. PMC's obligations under the guarantee are limited to the maximum amount that will not, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of PMC, result in the guarantee constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. The PMC Guarantee will:</p>
<p>·rank equal in right of payment to any of PMC's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and guarantees of PMC;</p>
<ul>
<li>·be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of PMC's existing and future secured indebtedness and secured guarantees to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or guarantees; and</li>
<li>·be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) and (to the extent not held by PMC) preferred stock, if any, of PMC's subsidiaries and of any entity PMC accounts for using the equity method of accounting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following summarized financial information for PMT and PMC is presented on a combined basis. Intercompany balances and transactions between PMT and PMC have been eliminated:</p>

<p>(1)Excludes equity in earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries.</p>
<h2>Debt Covenants</h2>
<p>Our debt financing agreements require us and certain of our subsidiaries to comply with various financial covenants. As of the filing of this Report, these financial covenants include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>·a minimum of $75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among the Company and/or our subsidiaries; a minimum of $75 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among our Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries; a minimum of $25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents between PMC and PMH; a minimum of $25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMC; and a minimum of $10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at PMH;</li>
<li>·a minimum tangible net worth for the Company of $1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for our Operating Partnership of $1.25 billion; a minimum tangible net worth for PMH of $250 million; and a minimum tangible net worth for PMC of $300 million;</li>
<li>·a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of less than 10:1 for PMC and PMH and 8.5:1 for the Company and our Operating Partnership; and</li>
<li>·at least two warehouse or repurchase facilities that finance amounts and assets similar to those being financed under our existing debt financing agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur and impact our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose.</p>
<p>PLS is also subject to various financial covenants, both as a borrower under its own financing arrangements and as our servicer under certain of our debt financing agreements. The most significant of these financial covenants currently include the following:</p>
<p>·a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $100 million;</p>
<ul>
<li>·a minimum tangible net worth of $1.25 billion;</li>
<li>·a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of 10:1; and</li>
<li>·at least one other warehouse or repurchase facility that finances amounts and assets that are similar to those being financed under certain of our existing secured financing agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of our debt financing agreements contain a condition precedent to obtaining additional funding that requires us to maintain positive net income for at least one (1) of the previous two consecutive quarters, or other similar measures. For the most recent fiscal quarter, the Company is compliant with all such conditions. However, we may be required to obtain waivers from certain lenders in the future if this condition precedent is not met.</p>
<p>Our debt financing agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement, although in some instances we may agree with the lender upon certain thresholds (in dollar amounts or percentages based on the market value of the assets) that must be exceeded before a margin deficit will arise. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements</h2>
<p>In addition to the financial covenants imposed upon us and PLS as our servicer under our debt financing agreements, we, through PMC and/or PLS, as applicable, are also subject to liquidity and net worth requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") for Agency seller/servicers and Ginnie Mae for single-family issuers. FHFA and Ginnie Mae have established minimum liquidity and net worth requirements for their approved non-depository single-family sellers/servicers in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae for its approved single-family issuers.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae has issued risk-based capital requirements which will be effective December 31, 2024. We believe that PLS is in compliance with the Agency's pending requirements as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Our Manager continues to explore a variety of additional means of financing our business, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, repurchase agreements, term financing, securitization transactions and unsecured debt and equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful.</p>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations</h2>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.</p>
<p>Our management, servicing, and loan fulfillment fee agreements are described in Note 4 Transactions with Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.</p>
<p>All debt financing arrangements that matured between June 30, 2024 and the date of this Report have been renewed, extended or replaced.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>Preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain of these estimates significantly influence the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies primarily relate to our fair value estimates.</p>
<p>Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which utilize relevant critical accounting estimates.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<p>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market-based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, inflation risk and market value risk.</p>
<p>Our primary trading asset is our inventory of loans acquired for sale. We believe that such assets' fair values respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable recently-originated loans. Our other market-risk assets are a substantial portion of our investments and are primarily comprised of MSRs, CRT arrangements and MBS. We believe that the fair values of MSRs and MBS also respond primarily to changes in the market interest rates for comparable loans or yields on MBS. Changes in interest rates are reflected in the prepayment speeds underlying these investments and in the pricing spread (an element of the discount rate) used in their valuation. We believe that the primary market risks to the fair values of our investment in CRT arrangements are changes in market credit spreads and the fair value of the real estate securing the loans underlying such arrangements.</p>
<p>The following sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated variables; do not incorporate changes to other variables; are subject to the accuracy of various models and assumptions used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect our overall financial performance in such scenarios, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the following estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.</p>

<p>(1)On October 24, 2022, the Company's board of trustees approved an increase to the Company's Common Share repurchase authorization from $400 million to $500 million (the "share repurchase program"). The share repurchase program does not require the Company to purchase a specific number of Common Shares, and the timing and amount of any Common Shares repurchased are based on market conditions and other factors, including price, regulatory requirements and capital availability. Common Share repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases, including pursuant to a trading plan implemented pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date but may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.</p>
