## EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023, of Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company") and Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"). Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company's business was conducted through a predecessor entity also known as Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Predecessor"). On December 14, 2022, the Predecessor's Board of Directors approved the entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "UPREIT Merger") with the company formerly known as New KRC Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecessor (the "Parent Company"), and KRC Merger Sub Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company ("Merger Sub"), to effect the reorganization (the "Reorganization") of the Predecessor's business into an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or "UPREIT".

On January 1, 2023, pursuant to the UPREIT Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, and each outstanding share of capital stock of the Predecessor was converted into one equivalent share of capital stock of the Parent Company (each of which has continued to trade under their respective existing ticker symbol with the same rights, powers and limitations that existed immediately prior to the Reorganization).

In connection with the Reorganization, the Parent Company changed its name to Kimco Realty Corporation, and replaced the Predecessor as the New York Stock Exchange-listed public company. Effective as of January 3, 2023, the Predecessor converted into a limited liability company, organized in the State of Delaware, known as Kimco Realty OP, LLC, the entity we refer to herein as "Kimco OP".

Following the Reorganization, substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP (either directly or through its subsidiaries), as the Company's operating company, and the Company is the managing member of Kimco OP. The officers and directors of the Company are the same as the officers and directors of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Reorganization.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the sole member and managing member of Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2023, the Parent Company owned 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

Stockholders' equity and members' capital are the primary areas of difference between the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of Kimco OP. Kimco OP's capital currently includes OP Units owned solely by the Parent, and may in the future include non-controlling OP Units owned by third parties. OP Units owned by third parties, if any, will be accounted for within capital on Kimco OP's financial statements and in non-controlling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.

The Parent Company consolidates Kimco OP for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in Kimco OP. Therefore, while stockholders' equity and members' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and Kimco OP are the same on their respective financial statements.

The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report provides the following benefits:

- ● Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and Kimco OP by enabling investors to view the businesses as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;
- ● Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and Kimco OP; and
- ● Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and Kimco OP, there are sections in this Quarterly Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and Kimco OP, including separate financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and Kimco OP, unless context otherwise requires, this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings of the Parent Company and/or Kimco OP as being the actions or holdings of the Company (either directly or through its subsidiaries, including Kimco OP).

Throughout this Quarterly Report, unless the context requires otherwise:

- ● The "Company," "we," "our" or "us" refer to:
- o for the period prior to January 1, 2023 (the period preceding the UPREIT Merger), the Predecessor and its business and operations conducted through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries;
- o for the period on or after January 1, 2023, (the period from and following the UPREIT Merger), the Parent Company and its business and operations conducted through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kimco OP; and
- o in statements regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), such terms refer solely to the Predecessor or Parent Company, as applicable.
- ● "Kimco OP" refers to Kimco Realty OP, LLC, our operating company following the UPREIT Merger.
- ● References to "shares" and "shareholders" refer to the shares and shareholders of the Predecessor prior to January 1, 2023 and of the Parent Company on or after January 1, 2023, and not the limited liability company interests of Kimco OP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Organization

______________________________________________________________________

Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Parent Company") is a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), of which substantially all of the Parent Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Parent Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"), either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Parent Company's operating company. The Parent Company is the sole managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2023, the Parent Company owned 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP. The term "the Company", means the Parent Company and Kimco OP, collectively.

The Company is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The Company's portfolio is primarily concentrated in the first-ring suburbs of the top major metropolitan markets, including those in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and rapidly expanding Sun Belt cities, with a tenant mix focused on essential, necessity-based goods and services that drive multiple shopping trips per week. The Company, its affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the ownership, management, development and operation of open-air shopping centers, including mixed-use assets which, are anchored primarily by grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants. Additionally, the Company provides complementary services that capitalize on the Company's established retail real estate expertise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders.

The Company elected status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning in its taxable year endedDecember 31, 1992 and operates in a manner that enables the Company to maintain its status as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, and is required to annually distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, including any net capital gains. In January 2023, the Company consummated the Reorganization into an UPREIT structure as described in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company, generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that have made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on its income, and the Company includes, when applicable, a provision for taxes in its condensed consolidated financial statements.

## Pending Merger with RPT Realty

On August 28, 2023, the Company and RPT Realty ("RPT") announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will acquire RPT through a series of mergers (collectively, the "RPT Merger"). This strategic transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Trustees of RPT. The RPT Merger is expected to close in the beginning of 2024, subject to the receipt of RPT shareholder approval and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share (other than certain shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued shares of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT (other than certain shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company having the rights, preferences and privileges substantially as set forth in the Merger Agreement, in each case, without interest, and subject to any withholding required under applicable law, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred expenses of $3.8 million associated with the RPT Merger primarily comprised of legal and professional fees.

## Economic Conditions

The economy continues to face several issues including inflation risk, liquidity constraints, lack of qualified employees, tenant bankruptcies and supply chain issues, which could impact the Company and its tenants. In response to the rising rate of inflation the Federal Reserve has steadily increased interest rates, and may continue to increase interest rates, until the rate of inflation begins to decrease. These increases in interest rates could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company's properties. As a result, the Company could feel pricing pressure on rents that it is able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rents and rent spreads could be negatively impacted. Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.

______________________________________________________________________

## Notes Payable

In February 2023, the Company obtained a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with a group of banks, which replaced the Company's existing $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature inMarch 2024. The Credit Facility is scheduled to expire in March 2027 with two additional six-month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company's discretion, toMarch 2028. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Parent Company. The Credit Facility could be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature. The Credit Facility is a green credit facility tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement. The Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate of Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the terms of the Credit Facility, plus 77.5 basis points and fluctuates in accordance with the Company's credit ratings. The interest rate can be further adjusted upward or downward by a maximum of four basis points (as of September 30, 2023, a two-basis point reduction was achieved) based on the sustainability metric targets, as defined in the agreement (6.17% as of September 30, 2023). Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company continues to be subject to the same covenants under the Company's prior unsecured revolving credit facility. For a full description of the Credit Facility's covenants refer to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2023, filed as Exhibit 10.20 in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Credit Facility had no outstanding balance, no appropriations for letters of credit, and the Company was in compliance with its covenants.

11. Noncontrolling Interests

______________________________________________________________________

Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity that the Company doesnot own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or having determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a VIE in accordance with the provisions of the FASB's Consolidation guidance. The Company accounts and reports for noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Consolidation guidance and the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance issued by the FASB. The Company identifies its noncontrolling interests separately within the equity section on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

12. Variable Interest Entities

______________________________________________________________________

## Consolidated Operating Properties

Included within the Company's operating properties atSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are 31 and 32 consolidated entities, respectively, that are VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. These entities have been established to own and operate real estate property. The Company's involvement with these entities is through its majority ownership and management of the properties. The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. The Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as a result of its controlling financial interest. At September 30, 2023, total assets of these VIEs were $1.8 billion and total liabilities were $188.0 million. At December 31, 2022, total assets of these VIEs were $1.8 billion and total liabilities were $199.1 million.

The majority of the operations of these VIEs are funded with cash flows generated from the properties. The Company hasnot provided financial support to any of these VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide, which consists primarily of funding any capital expenditures, including tenant improvements, which are deemed necessary to continue to operate the entity and any operating cash shortfalls that the entity may experience.

All liabilities of these consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Company ("VIE Liabilities"). The assets of the unencumbered VIEs are not restricted for use to settle only the obligations of these VIEs. The remaining VIE assets are encumbered by third-party non-recourse mortgage debt. The assets associated with these encumbered VIEs ("Restricted Assets") are collateral under the respective mortgages and are therefore restricted and can only be used to settle the corresponding liabilities of the VIE. The table below summarizes the consolidated VIEs and the classification of the Restricted Assets and VIE Liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (dollars in millions):

| | As of September 30, 2023 | As of December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of unencumbered VIEs | 29 | 29 |
| Number of encumbered VIEs | 2 | 3 |

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

## Unconsolidated Redevelopment Investment

Included in the Company's preferred equity investments atSeptember 30, 2023, is an unconsolidated development project which is a VIE for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. This preferred equity investment was primarily established to develop real estate property for long-term investment and was deemed a VIE primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support. The initial equity contributed to this entity was not sufficient to fully finance the real estate construction as development costs are funded by the partners over the construction period. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on the fact that the Company has shared control of this entity along with the entity's partners and therefore does not have a controlling financial interest.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company's investment in this VIE was $30.3 million, which is included in Other investments on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this VIE is estimated to be $34.3 million, which is the capital commitment obligation. The Company has not provided financial support to this VIE that it wasnot previously contractually required to provide. All future costs of development will be funded with capital contributions from the Company and the outside partner in accordance with their respective ownership percentages and construction loan financing.

13. Fair Value Measurements

______________________________________________________________________

All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies, reasonably approximate their fair values, except those listed below, for which fair values are disclosed. The valuation method used to estimate fair value for fixed-rate and variable-rate debt is based on discounted cash flow analyses, with assumptions that include credit spreads, market yield curves, trading activity, loan amounts and debt maturities. The fair values for marketable securities are based on published values, securities dealers' estimated market values or comparable market sales. The fair value for embedded derivative liability is based on using the "withand-without" method. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition.

As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimated fair value differs from the carrying value (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Carrying Value | Fair Value | Carrying Value | Fair Value |
| Notes payable, net (1) | $ 6,772,111 | $ 5,758,369 | $ 6,780,969 | $ 5,837,401 |
| Mortgages payable, net (2) | $ 356,899 | $ 322,664 | $ 376,917 | $ 311,659 |

The Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance, including available for sale securities and embedded derivative liabilities. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from various levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

The Company owns eight shopping center properties located in Long Island, NY, which were acquired during 2022 partially through the issuance of $122.1 million of Preferred Outside Partner Units and $13.6 million of Common Outside Partner Units. The Outside Partner Units related to these acquisitions totaled $135.7 million of units, including noncontrolling interests of $79.7 million and an embedded derivative liability associated with put and call options of these unitholders of $63.0 million as of September 30, 2023. The Outside Partner Units related annual cash distribution rates and related conversion features consisted of the following as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

| Type | Par Value Per | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $14.0 million. The Company's estimated fair values of these assets were primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, which were less than the carrying value of the assets. The Company does not have access to the unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair values of third-party offers. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of these investments was classified within Level3 of the fair value hierarchy.

14. Incentive Plans

______________________________________________________________________

In May 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Equity Participation Plan (the "2020 Plan"), which is a successor to the Restated Kimco Realty Corporation 2010 Equity Participation Plan (together with the2020 Plan, the "Plans") that expired inMarch 2020. The 2020 Plan provides for a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be reserved for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, stock payments and deferred stock awards. At September 30, 2023, the Company had 4.9 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.

The Company accounts for equity awards in accordance with FASB's Compensation - Stock Compensation guidance, which requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance shares, be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the service period based on their fair values. Fair value of performance awards is determined using the Monte Carlo method which is intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Fair value of restricted shares is calculated based on the price on the date of grant.

20. Defined Benefit Plan

______________________________________________________________________

In August 2021, the Company assumed sponsorship of Weingarten Realty Investors' noncontributory qualified cash balance retirement plan (the "Benefit Plan") in connection with the merger with Weingarten Realty Investors ("Weingarten"). The Benefit Plan was frozen as of the date of the merger and subsequently terminated as of December 31, 2021. On March 28, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") issued a favorable determination letter for the termination of the Benefit Plan. As a result, the Company elected to settle the Benefit Plan's obligations through third-party annuity payments, lump sum distributions and direct rollover of funds in an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA Rollovers") based on elections made by the Benefit Plan's participants.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Benefit Plan's obligations of $25.5 million were settled through third-party annuity contracts, lump sum distributions and IRA Rollovers. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Benefit Plan transferred excess assets with a value of $3.9 million to the qualified replacement plan managed by the Company and reverted excess assets with a value of $10.6 million to the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Benefit Plan had excess assets of with a value of $0.5 million remaining. Upon the liquidation of the Benefit Plan, the Company realized $10.8 million of settlement gains during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in Other income, net on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and were previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company incurred excise taxes of $2.2 million resulting from the pension reversion of excess pension plan assets during thethree months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in Other income, net on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

## Table of Contents

## Executive Overview

Kimco Realty Corporation is a REIT, of which substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP, either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Company's operating company. The Company is the sole managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2023, the Parent Company owned 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

The Company, a Maryland corporation, is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The terms "Kimco," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" each refers to Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders.

The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") and has owned and operated open-air shopping centers for over 60 years. The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had interests in 527 U.S. shopping center properties, aggregating 90.4 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), located in 28 states. In addition, the Company had 21 other property interests, primarily through the Company's preferred equity investments and other investments, totaling 5.5 million square feet of GLA. The Company's ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company's investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.

The Company's primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by:

- ● increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;
- ● increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios;
- ● improving debt metrics and upgraded unsecured debt ratings;
- ● continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and
- ● increasing the number of entitlements for residential use.

## Pending Merger with RPT Realty

On August 28, 2023, the Company and RPT announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will acquire RPT through a series of mergers (collectively the "RPT Merger"). This strategic transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Trustees of RPT. The RPT Merger is expected to close in the beginning of 2024, subject to the receipt of required RPT shareholder approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share (other than certain shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued shares of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT (other than certain shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company having the rights, preferences and privileges substantially as set forth in the Merger Agreement, in each case, without interest, and subject to any withholding required under applicable law, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.

The RPT Merger is expected to add 56 open-air shopping centers, including 43 wholly-owned and 13 joint venture assets, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, to the Company's existing portfolio. In addition, pursuant to the RPT Merger, the Company expects to obtain RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture. Beyond strengthening the Company's presence in its key markets, the transaction is expected to provide growth opportunities, including those associated with redevelopment.

The amounts presented herein for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, are solely the Company's stand-alone results of operations and therefore do not include RPT's results of operations for these periods.

## Table of Contents

## Economic Conditions

The economy continues to face several issues including inflation risk, liquidity constraints, the lack of qualified employees, tenant bankruptcies and supply chain issues, which could impact the Company and its tenants. In response to the rising rate of inflation the Federal Reserve has steadily increased interest rates, and may continue to increase interest rates, until the rate of inflation begins to decrease. These increases in interest rates could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company's properties. As a result, the Company could feel pricing pressure on rents that it is able to charge to new or renewing tenants, such that future rents and rent spreads could be negatively impacted.

Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.

## Effects of Inflation

Many of the Company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. To assist in partially mitigating the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation the Company's leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

The Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintain or improve its unsecured debt ratings.

For a full description of the Credit Facility's covenants refer to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2023, filed as Exhibit 10.20 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Credit Facility had no outstanding balance and no appropriations for letters of credit.

Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company, among other things, is subject to maintenance of various covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with these covenants. The financial covenants for the Credit Facility are as follows:

Table of Contents

| Covenant | Must Be | As of September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value ("GAV") | \<60% | 36% |
| Total Priority Indebtedness to GAV | \<35% | 1.4% |
| Unencumbered Asset Net Operating Income to Total Unsecured Interest Expense | >1.75x | 5.5x |
| Fixed Charge Total Adjusted EBITDA to Total Debt Service | >1.50x | 4.7x |

## Mortgages Payable -

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company (i) assumed $37.2 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt through the acquisition of two operating properties, which the Company subsequently repaid in March 2023 and (ii) repaid $12.0 million of mortgage debt that encumbered a consolidated joint venture operating property.

In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties to partially fund the capital needs of its real estate re-development and re-tenanting projects. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had over 480 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.

## Other -

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold 14.1 million shares of ACI held by the Company, generating net proceeds of $282.3 million. For tax purposes, the Company recognized a long-term capital gain of $241.2 million. The Company anticipates retaining the proceeds from this stock sale for general corporate purposes and will pay federal and state taxes of $61.0 million on the taxable gain. As of September 30, 2023, the Company held 14.2 million shares of ACI, which had a value of $323.3 million.

In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received $194.1 million representing its share of an ACI special dividend payment and recognized this as Special dividend income on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result, the Company anticipates it may need to make a special dividend payment to maintain its compliance with REIT distribution requirements. The payment of this special dividend may be in the form of cash, common stock or some combination thereof. The Company's determination regarding any such special dividend and the form thereof will be announced during the year ending December 31, 2023.

The Parent Company guarantees the unsecured debt instruments of Kimco OP. These guarantees by the Parent Company are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of such unsecured debt instruments.

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the Company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. At September 30, 2023, these letters of credit aggregated $39.6 million.

The Company has investments with a funding commitments of $64.7 million, of which $48.4 million has been funded as of September 30, 2023.

In connection with the construction of its development and redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of September 30, 2023, there were $18.4 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.

The Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency issued Series A bonds which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a development project in Sheridan, Colorado. These tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $45.5 million outstanding at September 30, 2023. The bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("PIF") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. The revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and PIF have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. The incremental taxes and PIF are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.

## Dividends -

In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Company's Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as it monitors sources of capital and evaluate the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio that reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid for common and preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $446.6 million and $396.2 million, respectively.

Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments with high credit rated institutions. The Company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the Company's REIT taxable income distribution requirements. On July 24, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the Company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (Classes L and M) which were paid on October 16, 2023 to shareholders of record on October 2, 2023. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, which was paid on September 21, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 7, 2023.

On October 23, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the Company's classes of cumulative redeemable preferred shares (Classes L and M), which are scheduled to be paid on January 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on January 2, 2024. Additionally, on October 23, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share, representing a 4.3% increase from the prior quarterly dividend of $0.23, payable on December 21, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2023.

## Funds From Operations

Funds From Operations ("FFO") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company's common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also made an election, in accordance with the NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper-2018 Restatement, to exclude from its calculation of FFO (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. As such, the Company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables, gains/impairments on other investments or other amounts considered incidental to its main business in NAREIT defined FFO.

The Company presents FFO available to the Company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO available to the Company's common shareholders when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of FFO available to the Company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.

FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

The Company's reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to FFO available to the Company's common shareholders is reflected in the table below (in thousands, except per share data).

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

## Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same property NOI")

Same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.

Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, TIFs and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company's proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company's method of calculating Same property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

The following is a reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to Same property NOI (in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

| Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests | 2,551 | (1,583 ) | 9,208 | (14,152 ) |
| Preferred dividends, net | 6,285 | 6,307 | 18,736 | 18,911 |

| Non-operational expense from joint ventures, net | 23,107 | 14,754 | 61,911 | 31,580 |
| Same property NOI | $ 332,438 | $ 324,105 | $ 980,695 | $ 961,328 |

Same property NOI increased by $8.3 million or 2.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in 2022. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $11.2 million primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity, partially offset by (ii) an increase in credit losses from tenants of $2.9 million.

Same property NOI increased by $19.4 million or 2.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period in 2022. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $35.0 million primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity, partially offset by (ii) an increase in credit losses from tenants of $15.6 million.

## Leasing Activity

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company executed 1,222 leases totaling 8.5 million square feet in the Company's consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 360 new leases and 862 renewals and options. The leasing costs associated with these new leases are estimated to aggregate $78.3 million, or $39.20 per square foot. These costs include $61.2 million of tenant improvements and $17.1 million of external leasing commissions. The average rent per square foot for (i) new leases was $21.40 and (ii) renewals and options was $18.70.

## Tenant Lease Expirations

At September 30, 2023, the Company has a total of 8,353 leases in its consolidated operating portfolio. The following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years, assuming no renewal options are exercised. For purposes of the table, the Total Annual Base Rent Expiring represents annualized rental revenue, excluding the impact of straight-line rent, for each lease that expires during the respective year. Amounts in thousands, except for number of leases data:

| Year Ending December 31, | Number of Leases Expiring | Square Feet Expiring | Total Annual Base Rent Expiring | % of Gross Annual Rent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 2033 | 386 | 2,953 | $ 56,700 | 4.4 % |

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from timeto-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The following table presents the carrying value of the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding, including fair market value adjustments and unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2023, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. In addition, the following table presents the fair value of the Company's debt obligations outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. The table does not include extension options where available (amounts in millions).

| | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | Thereafter | Total | Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Secured Debt | | | | | | | | |
| Fixed Rate | $ - | $ 13.0 | $ 51.6 | $ - | $ 33.9 | $ 240.6 | $ 339.1 | $ 305.2 |
| Average Interest Rate | - | 4.61 % | 3.50 % | - | 4.01 % | 4.22 % | 4.10 % | |
| Variable Rate | $ - | $ - | $ 17.8 | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ 17.8 | $ 17.5 |
| Average Interest Rate | - | - | 6.63 % | - | - | - | 6.63 % | |

| Fixed Rate | $ - | $ 648.7 | $ 749.2 | $ 782.8 | $ 436.3 | $ 4,155.1 | $ 6,772.1 | $ 5,758.4 |
| Average Interest Rate | - | 3.37 % | 3.48 % | 3.06 % | 4.03 % | 3.47 % | 3.45 % | |

Based on the Company's variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 if shortterm interest rates were 1.0% higher.

## Risks Relating to the RPT Merger

## The pending RPT Merger may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all.

We expect that the RPT Merger will be completed in the first quarter of 2024, assuming all the conditions to closing in the RPT Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived. The completion of the RPT Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including, among others, the approval of the RPT Merger by the holders of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of RPT's common shares.

We cannot provide assurance that the conditions to completing the RPT Merger will be satisfied or waived, or that other events (some of which may be beyond our or RPT's control) will not intervene to delay or result in the termination of the proposed RPT Merger, and accordingly, that the RPT Merger will be completed on the terms or timeline that the parties anticipate or at all. If any condition to the RPT Merger is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the RPT Merger from occurring, which could negatively impact the price of our securities and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, either the Company or RPT may terminate the RPT Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among other reasons, (i) if the RPT Merger are not completed on or before May 28, 2024, or if, prior to RPT obtaining approval of its shareholders, and upon payment of the applicable termination fee, RPT decides to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a superior acquisition proposal.

## Table of Contents

## Failure to complete the pending RPT Merger could have an adverse effect on us.

Either we or RPT may terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances. If the RPT Merger is not completed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the RPT Merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

- ● the market price of our securities could decline;
- ● we will have incurred substantial costs relating to the RPT Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and integration costs that have already been incurred or will continue to be incurred until the closing of the Merger, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects;
- ● we could be subject to litigation in connection with the RPT Merger, including related to any failure to complete the RPT Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement;
- ● we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by management to matters relating to the RPT Merger that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and
- ● we may experience reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the RPT Merger or negative reactions from the financial markets or from our tenants, managers, vendors, employees and other commercial relationships.

Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Similarly, delays in the completion of the RPT Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the RPT Merger including the diversion of management's attention, and negative market reaction and impact on the market price of our securities to announcements relating to the RPT Merger, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects after the RPT Merger.

## The Company may incur adverse tax consequences if the Company or RPT has failed or fails to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Each of the Company and RPT has operated in a manner that it believes has allowed it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code and intends to continue to do so through the closing date or through the taxable year ending with the RPT Merger, respectively. Additionally, the Company and RPT intend that the Company will continue to operate in such a manner after the RPT Merger. It is a condition to the obligation of the Company to complete the RPT Merger that (i) the Company receive an opinion from RPT's REIT counsel to the effect that (A) commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015 through its taxable year ending with the RPT Merger, RPT has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and (B) RPT's prior, current and proposed ownership, organization and method of operations as described in a representation letter provided by RPT have allowed and will continue to allow RPT to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015 through its taxable year ending with the RPT Merger and (ii) RPT receive an opinion from the Company's REIT counsel to the effect that (A) commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015 through its taxable year ended December 31, 2022, the Predecessor was organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and (B) commencing with the Company's taxable year ending December 31, 2023, the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and the Company's proposed method of operation will enable the Company to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. The opinions will be subject to customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and will be based on customary representations made by RPT and the Company. If any such representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete, such opinions may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. In addition, the opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position or that such position would not be sustained. Moreover, neither the Company nor RPT has requested or plans to request a ruling from the IRS that it qualifies as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations is greater in the case of a REIT that holds assets through a partnership, like RPT does and the Company will following the RPT Merger. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the Company's and RPT's control may affect their ability to qualify as REITs.

If the Company has failed or fails to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce its cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to its stockholders, because:

- ● it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net income at regular corporate rates for the years it did not qualify for taxation as a REIT (and, for such years, would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income);
- ● it could be subject to any applicable corporate alternative minimum tax, stock buyback excise tax, and possibly increased state and local taxes for such periods;
- ● unless it is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, neither it nor any "successor" company could elect to be taxed as a REIT until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified;
- ● if it were to re-elect REIT status, it would have to distribute all earning and profits from non-REIT years before the end of the first new REIT taxable year; and
- ● for the five-year period following re-election of REIT status, upon a taxable disposition of any of asset owned as of such re-election, it could be subject to corporate-level tax with respect to all or a portion of the gain so recognized.

## Table of Contents

Even if the Company retains its REIT status, if RPT loses its REIT status for a taxable year ending on or before the RPT Merger, the Company could be subject to adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce its cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to stockholders, because:

- ● The Company, as the successor by merger to RPT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, would be subject to any corporate income tax liabilities of RPT, including penalties and interest;
- ● The Company would be subject to corporate level tax on the built-in gain on each asset of RPT existing at the time of the RPT Merger if the Company were to dispose of the RPT asset during the five-year period following the RPT Merger; and
- ● The Company would succeed to any earnings and profits accumulated by RPT for taxable periods that it did not qualify as a REIT, and the Company would have to pay a special dividend and/or employ applicable deficiency dividend procedures (including interest payments to the IRS) to eliminate such earnings and profits (if the Company does not timely distribute those earnings and profits, it could fail to qualify as a REIT).

In addition, if there is an adjustment to RPT's taxable income or dividends paid deductions, the Company could elect to use the deficiency dividend procedure in order to maintain RPT's REIT status. That deficiency dividend procedure could require the Company to make significant distributions to its stockholders and to pay significant interest to the IRS.

As a result of all these factors, the failure of any of the Company (before or after the RPT Merger) or RPT (before the RPT Merger) to qualify as a REIT could impair the Company's ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of its securities.

## Risks Relating to the Company after Completion of the RPT Merger

## We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the RPT Merger.

We expect to incur substantial expenses in completing the RPT Merger and integrating the business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the Company and RPT. There are a large number of processes that must be integrated in the RPT Merger, including leasing, billing, management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll and benefits, fixed asset, lease administration and regulatory compliance. While we and RPT have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of such integration expenses.

## Our stockholders may be diluted by the RPT Merger and the trading price of shares of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of shares of our common stock before the RPT Merger.

The RPT Merger may dilute the ownership position of our stockholders. Upon completion of the RPT Merger, our legacy stockholders will own approximately 92% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, and legacy RPT stockholders will own approximately 8% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Consequently, our stockholders may have less influence over our management and policies after the effective time of the RPT Merger than they currently exercise over our management and policies. The results of our operations and the trading price of our common stock after the RPT Merger may also be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our results of operations and the trading prices of our common stock. For example, some of our and RPT's existing institutional investors may elect to decrease their ownership in the combined company. Accordingly, the historical trading prices and financial results of the Company and RPT may not be indicative of these matters for the combined company after the RPT Merger.

## Following the RPT Merger, we may be unable to integrate the business of RPT successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the RPT Merger or do so within the anticipated time frame.

The RPT Merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of RPT. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:

- ● the inability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and RPT in a manner that permits the Company to achieve the anticipated cost savings from the RPT Merger, which would result in some anticipated benefits of the RPT Merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated, or at all;
- ● the failure to integrate operations and internal systems, programs and controls within the expected time frame or at all;
- ● the inability to successfully realize the anticipated value from some of RPT's assets;
- ● lost sales and tenants as a result of certain tenants of either of the Company or RPT deciding not to continue to do business with the combined company;
- ● the complexities associated with managing the combined Company;

## Table of Contents

- ● the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, markets, strategies and customer bases;
- ● any failure of the combined company to retain key employees of either of the two companies;
- ● potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the RPT Merger; and
- ● performance shortfalls at either or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the RPT Merger and integrating the companies' operations.

For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Company to maintain relationships with tenants, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated future opportunities, plans and benefits of the RPT Merger, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.

## Following the RPT Merger, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future.

We have substantial indebtedness and, in connection with the RPT Merger, will incur additional indebtedness. The incurrence of new indebtedness could have adverse consequences on our business following the RPT Merger, such as:

- ● requiring the Company to use a substantial portion of our cash flow provided by operating activities to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the available cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, and other general corporate purposes and reduce cash for distributions;
- ● limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;
- ● increasing our costs of incurring additional debt;
- ● increasing our exposure to floating interest rates;
- ● limiting our ability to compete with other companies that are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions;
- ● restricting the Company from making strategic acquisitions, developing properties, or exploiting business opportunities;
- ● restricting the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness;
- ● exposing the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under covenants contained in our debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations;
- ● increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions; and
- ● limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in its industry.

The impact of any of these potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

## Counterparties to certain agreements with RPT may exercise their contractual rights under such agreements in connection with the RPT Merger.

RPT is party to certain agreements that give the counterparty certain rights following a "change in control," including in some cases the right to terminate such agreements. Under some such agreements, for example certain debt obligations, the RPT Merger may constitute a change in control and therefore the counterparty may exercise certain rights under the agreement upon the closing of the RPT Merger. Any such counterparty may request modifications of its respective agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under its agreement. There is no assurance that such counterparties will not exercise their rights under such agreements, including termination rights where available, that the exercise of any such rights will not result in a material adverse effect or that any modifications of such agreements will not result in a material adverse effect to the combined company or its securities subsequent to the RPT Merger.
