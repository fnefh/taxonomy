## EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, of Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company") and Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"). Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company's business was conducted through a predecessor entity also known as Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Predecessor"). On December 14, 2022, the Predecessor's Board of Directors approved the entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "UPREIT Merger") with the company formerly known as New KRC Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecessor (the "Parent Company"), and KRC Merger Sub Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company ("Merger Sub"), to effect the reorganization (the "Reorganization") of the Predecessor's business into an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or "UPREIT".

On January 1, 2023, pursuant to the UPREIT Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, and each outstanding share of capital stock of the Predecessor was converted into one equivalent share of capital stock of the Parent Company (each share of which has continued to trade under their respective existing ticker symbol with the same rights, powers and limitations that existed immediately prior to the Reorganization).

In connection with the Reorganization, the Parent Company changed its name to Kimco Realty Corporation, and replaced the Predecessor as the New York Stock Exchange-listed public company. Effective as of January 3, 2023, the Predecessor converted into a limited liability company, organized in the State of Delaware, known as Kimco Realty OP, LLC, the entity we refer to herein as "Kimco OP".

Following the Reorganization, substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP (either directly or through its subsidiaries), as the Company's operating company, and the Company is the managing member of Kimco OP. The officers and directors of the Company are the same as the officers and directors of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Reorganization.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the managing member of Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

Stockholders' equity and members' capital are the primary areas of difference between the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of Kimco OP. Kimco OP's capital currently includes OP Units owned by the Parent and non-controlling OP Units owned by third parties. OP Units owned by third parties are accounted for within capital on Kimco OP's financial statements and in non-controlling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.

The Parent Company consolidates Kimco OP for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in Kimco OP. Therefore, while stockholders' equity, members' capital and noncontrolling interests differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and Kimco OP are the same on their respective financial statements.

- The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report provides the following benefits: ·Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and Kimco OP by enabling investors to view the businesses as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;
- ·Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.
- ·Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation, because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and Kimco OP; and

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and Kimco OP, there are sections in this Quarterly Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and Kimco OP, including separate financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and Kimco OP, unless context otherwise requires, this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings of the Parent Company and/or Kimco OP as being the actions or holdings of the Company (either directly or through its subsidiaries, including Kimco OP).

Throughout this Quarterly Report, unless the context requires otherwise:

- ·The "Company," "we," "our" or "us" refer to:

othe Parent Company and its business and operations conducted through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kimco OP; and oin statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to the Predecessor or Parent Company, as applicable.

- ·"Kimco OP" refers to Kimco Realty OP, LLC, our operating company following the UPREIT Merger.
- ·References to "shares" and "shareholders" refer to the shares and shareholders of the Parent Company and not the limited liability company interests of Kimco OP.

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Organization

______________________________________________________________________

Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Parent Company") operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), of which substantially all of the Parent Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Parent Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"), either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Parent Company's operating company. The Parent Company is the managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP. The terms "Kimco", "the Company" and "our" each refer to the Parent Company and Kimco OP, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation.

The Company is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The Company's portfolio is primarily concentrated in the first-ring suburbs of the top major metropolitan markets, including those in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and rapidly expanding Sun Belt cities, with a tenant mix focused on essential, necessity-based goods and services that drive multiple shopping trips per week. The Company, its affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the ownership, management, development and operation of open-air shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, which are anchored primarily by grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants. Additionally, the Company provides complementary services that capitalize on the Company's established retail real estate expertise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. The Company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

The Company elected status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992 and operates in a manner that enables the Company to maintain its status as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, and is required to annually distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, including any net capital gains. In January 2023, the Company consummated the Reorganization into an UPREIT structure as described in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company, generally, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that have made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on its income, and the Company includes, when applicable, a provision for taxes in its condensed consolidated financial statements.

## RPT Merger

On August 28, 2023, the Company and RPT Realty ("RPT") announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company would acquire RPT through a series of mergers (collectively, the "RPT Merger"). On January 2, 2024, RPT merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company. The RPT Merger added 56 open-air shopping centers, 43 of which were wholly owned and 13 of which are owned through a joint venture, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). In addition, as a result of the RPT Merger, the Company obtained RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued share of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of the Company's newly issued 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Class N Preferred Stock").

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred expenses of $25.2 million associated with the RPT Merger, primarily comprised of severance, legal and professional fees. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

______________________________________________________________________

## Basis of Presentation

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and Kimco OP and their consolidated subsidiaries. The Reorganization resulted in a merger of entities under common control in accordance with GAAP. The Company's subsidiaries include subsidiaries which are wholly owned or which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE") in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The Parent Company serves as the general member of Kimco OP. The limited members of Kimco OP have limited rights over Kimco OP and do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Kimco OP's economic performance. As such, Kimco OP is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The information presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is unaudited and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented, and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Amounts as of December 31, 2023 included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of that date, but does not include all annual disclosures required by GAAP. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as certain disclosures in this Quarterly Report that would duplicate those included in such Annual Report on Form 10-K are not included in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 2, 2024, the Parent Company, as managing member of Kimco OP, entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Kimco OP (the "Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement"), providing for, among other things, the creation of Class N Preferred Units of Kimco OP, having the preferences, rights and limitations set forth therein, and certain modifications to the provisions regarding LTIP Units (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement), including provisions governing distribution and tax allocation requirements and the procedures for converting LTIP Units.

## Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

## New Accounting Pronouncements

The following table represents Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") to the FASB's ASC that, as of September 30, 2024, are not yet effective for the Company and for which the Company has not elected early adoption, where permitted:

| ASU | Description | Effective Date | Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures | The amendments in this ASU improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. | Annual fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025; Early adoption permitted | There are aspects of this ASU that apply to entities with one reportable segment. The Company will review the extent of new disclosures necessary prior to implementation. Other than additional disclosure, the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's |
| ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement | The amendments in this ASU address the accounting for contributions made to a joint venture, upon formation, in a joint venture's separate financial statements. To reduce diversity in practice and provide decision-useful information to a joint venture's investors, these amendments require that a joint venture apply a new basis of accounting upon formation. By applying a new basis of accounting, a joint venture, upon formation, will recognize and initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value (with exceptions to fair value measurement that are consistent with the business combinations guidance). Additionally, existing joint ventures have the option to apply the guidance retrospectively. | January 1, 2025; Early adoption permitted | This ASU does not impact accounting for joint ventures by the venturers. As such, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and/or results of operations. |
| ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures | This ASU requires entities to provide additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance requires public business entities to disclose in their rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and to provide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance requires all entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes and to disaggregate the information by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. | Annual fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, and interim periods for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2026; Early adoption permitted | The Company will review the extent of new disclosures necessary prior to implementation. Other than additional disclosure, the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position and/or results of operations. |

## Regulatory Update

On March 6, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted final rules that will require registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, including material climate-related risks and impacts, descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities, and any material climate-related targets or goals. The landmark rules also will require accelerated and large accelerated filers to disclose material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. These disclosures will be subject to independent third-party assurance. Registrants will also have to disclose, among other things, certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions and amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates in their audited financial statements. On March 15, 2024, a federal appellate court imposed a temporary stay pending judicial review of these new rules. The SEC voluntarily stayed its recently adopted climate disclosure rules pending the completion of judicial review. The Company plans to comply with the disclosure requirements of the final rules when they become effective, and are currently evaluating the impact these final rules will have on the Company's SEC filings and related disclosures.

3. RPT Merger

On January 2, 2024, the Company completed the Merger with RPT, under which RPT merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company. The RPT Merger added 56 open-air shopping centers, 43 of which were wholly owned and 13 of which are owned through a joint venture, comprising 13.3 million square feet of GLA. In addition, pursuant to the RPT Merger, the Company obtained RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture.

The Company is in the process of reviewing the assumptions and inputs used by the third-party valuation specialist to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management's policy. Therefore, the final acquisition accounting adjustments, including the purchase price and its allocation, are not yet complete as of this filing. Once the purchase price and allocation are complete, an adjustment to the provisional purchase price or allocation may occur. Additionally, any excess purchase price, which could differ materially, may result in the recognition of goodwill, the amount of which may be significant.

______________________________________________________________________

## Notes Payable

On September 9, 2024, Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a rating of A- for its senior unsecured debt, assigned a BBB credit rating for its preferred stock, and assigned its 'Stable' rating outlook. As a result, the Company achieved certain interest rate reductions and facility fee reductions for its Credit Facility and unsecured term loans.

The Company has a $2.0 billion Credit Facility with a group of banks. The Credit Facility is scheduled to expire in March 2027 with two additional six-month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company's discretion, to March 2028. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Parent Company. The Credit Facility can be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature. The Credit Facility is a green credit facility tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement. The Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate of Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), as defined in the terms of the Credit Facility, plus 77.5 basis points and fluctuates in accordance with the Company's credit ratings. The interest rate can be further adjusted upward or downward based on the sustainability metric targets and the Company's credit rating outlook, as defined in the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Credit Facility is Adjusted Term SOFR plus 68.5 basis points (5.53% as of September 30, 2024) after reductions for sustainability metrics achieved and an upgraded credit rating profile. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is subject to certain covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Facility had no outstanding balance, no appropriations for letters of credit, and the Company was in compliance with its covenants.

In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company assumed the following notes payable (dollars in millions):

| Type | Amount Assumed | Interest Rate | Maturity Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured notes (1) | 511.5 | 3.64%-4.74% | Jun-25-Nov-31 |
| Unsecured term loan (2) | 50 | 4.15% | Nov-26 |
| Unsecured term loan (2) | 100 | 4.11% | Feb-27 |
| Unsecured term loan (2) | 50 | 3.43% | Aug-27 |
| Unsecured term loan (2) | 110 | 3.71% | Feb-28 |

(1)The Company fully repaid these unsecured notes in January 2024 and incurred a make-whole charge of $0.3 million resulting from this early repayment of these notes, which are included in Merger charges on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

(2)The Company entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, through which the assumed term loans were terminated (fully repaid) and new term loans were issued to replace the assumed loans. The new term loans retained the amounts and maturities of the assumed term loans, however the rates (Adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.905% and fluctuate based on credit rating profile and achieving sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement) and covenants were revised to match those within the Company's Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on these term loans is Adjusted Term SOFR plus 81.0 basis points after reductions for sustainability metrics achieved and an upgraded credit rating profile. The Company entered into 20 swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the interest rates to all-in fixed rates (ranging from 4.5793% to 4.7801% as of September 30, 2024). See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for interest rate swap disclosure.

During September 2024, the Company issued $500.0 million in senior unsecured notes, which are scheduled to mature in March 2035 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.85% per annum. These senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by the Parent Company.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") pursuant to a credit agreement, which matures in January 2026, with three one-year extension options. The Term Loan Credit Facility accrues interest at a spread (currently 0.800% after reductions for sustainability metrics achieved and an upgraded credit rating profile) to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the credit agreement), that fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Company's senior debt ratings. In addition, during the three months ended September 30 2024, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Facility, in separate transactions, to increase the aggregate principal amount from $200.0 million to $550.0 million. The additional $350.0 million is subject to the same terms as the existing Term Loan Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had six swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the overall interest rate on the $550.0 million Term Loan Credit Facility to an all-in fixed rate of 4.6122%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for interest rate swap disclosure.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company fully repaid the following notes payables (dollars in millions):

| Type | Date Paid | Amount Repaid | Interest Rate | Maturity Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured note | Jan-24 | 246.2 | 4.45% | Jan-24 |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid $11.8 million of mortgage debt that encumbered three operating properties.

12. Derivatives

______________________________________________________________________

Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risks primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may use derivatives to manage exposures that arise

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

from changes in interest rates and limits the risk by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into 26 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating to $860.0 million. The Company did not enter into any interest rate swap agreements during 2023. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued, as interest rates change, and recognized as Interest expense in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. If the hedges are deemed to be effective, the fair value is included within the Accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income ("AOCI") on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of September 30, 2024, all interest rate swaps were deemed effective and are therefore included within AOCI. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects approximately $0.4 million of accumulated comprehensive income on derivative instruments to be reclassified into earnings as a reduction to interest expense during the next 12 months.

The interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company classifies the interest rate swaps as Level 2 and are measured on a recurring basis.

The following table summarizes the terms and fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 (amounts in thousands):

| Instrument | Number of Swap Agreements | Associated Debt Instrument | Effective Date | Maturity Date | Notional Amount (1) | Fair Value (2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interest rate swap | 1 | $200.0 Million Term Loan | Jan-24 | Jan-29 | $ (200,000 ) | $ (3,137 ) |
| Interest rate swaps | 3 | $50.0 Million Term Loan | Jan-24 | Nov-26 | (50,000 ) | (496 ) |

| | | | | | $ (860,000 ) | $ (14,230 ) |

The table below details the location in the financial statements of the gain/(loss) recognized on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (amounts in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amount of loss recognized in AOCI on interest rate swaps, net | $ | (18,978 ) $ | (6,996 ) |
| Amount reclassified from AOCI into income as Interest expense | $ | 3,072 $ | 7,234 |
| Total amount of Interest expense presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in which the effects of cash flow hedges are being recorded | $ | (76,216 ) $ | (224,122 ) |

The Company has interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, which have interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's share of the change in fair value of the cash flow hedges for interest payments was $0.7 million and $3.3 million, respectively, which is included within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

13. Noncontrolling Interests

______________________________________________________________________

Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or having determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a VIE in accordance with the provisions of the FASB's Consolidation guidance. The Company accounts and reports for noncontrolling interests in accordance with

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

the Consolidation guidance and the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance issued by the FASB. The Company identifies its noncontrolling interests separately within the equity section on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are presented separately on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

In connection with the RPT Merger, the Parent Company issued 953,400 OP units in Kimco OP, which had a fair market value of $21.0 million. Upon consummation of the RPT Merger, the Parent Company owned 99.86% of the outstanding OP Units in Kimco OP, which is no longer a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Parent Company issued 326,140 long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") OP Units. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding OP units in Kimco OP.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired the remaining outside partners' interests in a consolidated property for a purchase price of $3.3 million. This transaction resulted in a decrease in Noncontrolling interests of $3.8 million and a corresponding decrease in Paid-in capital of $0.5 million on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company owns eight shopping center properties located in Long Island, NY, which were acquired during 2022, partially through the issuance of $122.1 million of Preferred Outside Partner Units and $13.6 million of Common Outside Partner Units. The noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine equity and included in Redeemable noncontrolling interests on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of the put right available to the unit holders, an event that is not solely in the Company's control. During 2024, 101,369 Preferred Outside Partner Units and 3,441 Common Outside Partner Units were redeemed for cash of $2.1 million, in separate transactions. These transactions resulted in a net decrease in Redeemable noncontrolling interests of $1.3 million and a decrease in the embedded derivative liability in Other liabilities of $0.8 million on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Outside Partner Units related to these acquisitions total $91.9 million, including noncontrolling interests of $63.5 million and an embedded derivative liability associated with put and call options of these unitholders of $28.4 million. The Outside Partner Units related annual cash distribution rates and related conversion features consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024:

| Type | Par Value Per Unit | Number of Units Remaining | Return Per Annum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preferred Outside Partner Units | 20 | 3,876,935 | 3.75% |
| Common Outside Partner Units | 20 | 618,317 | Equal to the Company's common stock dividend |

Included within noncontrolling interests are units that were determined to be contingently redeemable that are classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interests and presented in the mezzanine section between Total liabilities and Stockholders' equity on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the change in the redemption value of the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

| | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

14. Variable Interest Entities

______________________________________________________________________

## Consolidated Operating Properties

Included within the Company's operating properties at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are 29 and 30 consolidated entities, respectively, that are VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. These entities have been established to own and operate real estate property. The Company's involvement with these entities is through its majority ownership and management of the properties. The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. The Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as a result of its controlling financial interest. At September 30, 2024, total assets of these VIEs were $1.7 billion, and total liabilities were $169.9 million. At December 31, 2023, total assets of these VIEs were $1.8 billion, and total liabilities were $180.9 million.

The majority of the operations of these VIEs are funded with cash flows generated from the properties. The Company has not provided financial support to any of these VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide, which consists primarily of funding any capital expenditures, including tenant improvements, which are deemed necessary to continue to operate the entity and any operating cash shortfalls that the entity may experience.

All liabilities of these consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Company ("VIE Liabilities"). The assets of the unencumbered VIEs are not restricted for use to settle only the obligations of these VIEs. The remaining VIE assets are encumbered by third-party non-recourse mortgage debt. The assets associated with these encumbered VIEs ("Restricted Assets") are collateral under the respective mortgages and are therefore restricted and can only be used to settle the corresponding liabilities of the VIE. The table below summarizes the consolidated VIEs and the classification of the Restricted Assets and VIE Liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, exclusive of Kimco OP, as follows (dollars in millions):

| | As of September 30, 2024 | As of December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of unencumbered VIEs | 27 | 28 |
| Number of encumbered VIEs | 2 | 2 |
| Total number of consolidated VIEs | 29 | 30 |
| Restricted Assets: | | |
| Real estate, net | 326.0 | 379.8 |
| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | 3.4 | 3.9 |
| Accounts and notes receivable, net | 2.5 | 3.6 |
| Other assets | 1.8 | 1.3 |
| VIE Liabilities: | | |
| Mortgages payable, net | 85.3 | 97.3 |
| Accounts payable and accrued expenses | 16.9 | 11.4 |
| Operating lease liabilities | 4.9 | 5.0 |
| Other liabilities | 62.8 | 67.2 |
| Total VIE Liabilities | 169.9 | 180.9 |

## Unconsolidated Redevelopment Investment

Included in the Company's preferred equity investments at September 30, 2024, is an unconsolidated development project which is a VIE for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. This preferred equity investment was primarily established to develop real estate property for long-term investment and was deemed a VIE primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support. The initial equity contributed to this entity was not sufficient to fully finance the real estate construction as development costs are funded by the partners over the construction period. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on the fact that the Company has shared control of this entity along with the entity's partners and therefore does not have a controlling financial interest.

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

As of September 30, 2024, the Company's investment in this VIE was $37.3 million, which is included in Other investments on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this VIE is the Company's carrying value in this investment. The Company has not provided financial support to this VIE that it was not previously contractually required to provide. All future costs of development will be funded with construction loan financing or capital contributions from the Company and the outside partner in accordance with their respective ownership percentages if necessary.

15. Fair Value Measurements

______________________________________________________________________

All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies, reasonably approximate their fair values, except those listed below, for which fair values are disclosed. The valuation method used to estimate fair value for fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, and mortgage and other finance receivables, is based on discounted cash flow analyses, with assumptions that include credit spreads, market yield curves, trading activity, loan amounts and debt maturities. The fair values for marketable securities are based on published values, securities dealers' estimated market values or comparable market sales. The fair value for embedded derivative liability is based on using the "with-and-without" method. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimated fair value differs from the carrying amount (in thousands):

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Fair Value Hierarchy | Carrying Amounts | Estimated Fair Value | Carrying Amounts | Estimated Fair Value |
| Assets: | | | | | |
| Mortgage and other financing receivables (1) | Level 3 | $ 456,917 | $ 459,049 | $ 130,745 | $ 122,323 |
| Liabilities: | | | | | |
| Notes payable, net (2) | | | | | |
| Senior unsecured notes | Level 2 | $ 7,109,218 | $ 6,728,623 | $ 7,262,851 | $ 6,671,450 |
| Term loans | Level 3 | $ 857,722 | $ 861,493 | $ - | $ - |
| Mortgages payable, net (3) | Level 3 | $ 335,275 | $ 321,280 | $ 353,945 | $ 329,955 |

The Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance, including available for sale securities, interest rate swaps and embedded derivative liabilities. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The tables below present the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregated by the level of the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):

The significant unobservable input (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the Company's embedded derivative liability, which is categorized with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is the discount rate of 5.70% and 6.40% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The table below presents the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liability measured using Level 3 inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

| | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | December 31, 2023 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| Real estate | 11,724 | | - | 11,724 |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $4.3 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The Company's estimated fair values of these assets were primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, which were less than the carrying value of the assets. The Company does not have access to the unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair values of third-party offers. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of these investments was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

16. Incentive Plans

______________________________________________________________________

The Company has an Equity Participation Plan (as amended and/or restated, the "Equity Plan"), which provides for a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be reserved for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, LTIP Units, stock payments and deferred stock awards. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the Equity Plan.

The Company accounts for equity awards in accordance with FASB's compensation - Stock Compensation guidance, which requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and LTIP Units, be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the service period based on their fair values. Fair value of performance awards is determined using the Monte Carlo method, which is intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Fair value of restricted shares is calculated based on the price on the date of grant.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

ratably over five years subject to continued employment. Compensation expense for these units is being recognized over a five-year period.

The aggregate grant-date fair value of the Time-Based LTIP Units for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.4 million. Granted Time-Based LTIP Units do not have redemption rights, but any OP Units into which units are converted are entitled to redemption rights. The Time-Based LTIPs were valued based on the Company's closing common share price on the date of grant.

## Performance-Based LTIP Units

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted to certain employees 205,440 LTIP Units with performance-based vesting requirements ("Performance-Based LTIP Units") and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $18.14 per unit.

Performance-Based LTIP Units are performance-based equity compensation pursuant to which participants have the opportunity to earn LTIP Units based on the total shareholder return of the Company's common shares relative to its peers, as defined, or based on other performance criteria as determined by the Board of Directors, over the defined performance period. Any Performance-Based LTIP Units that are earned vest at the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense for these units is recognized over the performance period.

The aggregate grant-date fair value of the Performance-Based LTIP Units for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.7 million, valued using Monte Carlo simulations based on the following significant assumptions:

| | 2024 |
| --- | --- |
| Stock price | 19.53 |
| Dividend yield (1) | - |
| Risk-free interest rate | 4.39 % |
| Volatility (2) | 28.85 % |
| Term of the award (years) | 2.87 |

(1)Total Shareholder Returns, as used in the performance share awards computation, are measured based on cumulative dividend stock prices, as such a zero percent dividend yield is utilized.

(2)Volatility is based on the annualized standard deviation of the daily logarithmic returns on dividend-adjusted closing prices over the look-back period based on the term of the award.

(1)The effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units and convertible preferred units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Net income available to Kimco OP's common unitholders per unit. Accordingly, the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per unit calculations.

Unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. The impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares' participation rights in undistributed earnings.

## Executive Overview

Kimco Realty Corporation is a REIT, of which substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP, either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Company's operating company. The Company is the managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

The Company is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The terms "Kimco," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" each refers to Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders.

The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") and has owned and operated open-air shopping centers for over 60 years. The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interests in 567 U.S. shopping center properties, aggregating 100.5 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), located in 30 states. In addition, the Company had 67 other property interests, primarily including net leased properties, preferred equity investments, and other investments, totaling 5.5 million square feet of GLA. The Company's ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company's investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.

The Company's primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of mixeduse assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by:

- ·increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios;
- ·continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and
- ·maintaining strong debt metrics and our A-/BBB+/Baa1 unsecured debt ratings;
- ·increasing the number of entitlements for residential use.

On September 9, 2024, Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a rating of A- for its senior unsecured debt, assigned a BBB credit rating for its preferred stock, and assigned its 'Stable' rating outlook. As a result, the Company achieved certain interest rate reductions and facility fee reduction for its unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") and unsecured term loans.

## RPT Merger

On January 2, 2024, RPT Realty merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") between the Company and RPT, which was entered into on August 28, 2023. As a result of the RPT Merger, three Company acquired 56 open-air shopping centers, including 43 wholly owned and 13 joint venture assets, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, to the Company's existing portfolio. The Company also obtained RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued share of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of the Company's 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class N Preferred Stock"). In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company issued 53.0 million shares of common stock, 1,849 shares of Class N Preferred Stock, and 953,400 OP Units. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the RPT Merger.

## Economic Conditions

The economy continues to face challenges which could impact the Company and its tenants, including elevated inflation rates. In response to the elevated rate of inflation, the Federal Reserve steadily increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023. During September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target range for federal funds rate by 0.50% to 4.75%-5.00%, which cut its overnight borrowing rate by 0.50%, as it believed certain indicators suggested that economic activity has continued to expand and inflation has made downward progress. This reduction is intended to support growth and stabilize the labor market. Fluctuations of certain economic data and indicators could impact future interest rate considerations by the Federal Reserve. Despite this reduction, interest rate levels could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company's properties.

Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.

## Effects of Inflation

Many of the Company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. To assist in partially mitigating the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation, the Company's leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's capital resources include accessing the public debt and equity capital markets, unsecured term loans, mortgages and construction loan financing, and immediate access to the Credit Facility with bank commitments of $2.0 billion, which can be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature.

The Company anticipates that net cash flow provided by operating activities, borrowings under its Credit Facility and the issuance of equity, public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital requirements for both its short-term and long-term liquidity needs, which could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of inflation, interest rates, and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A.

The Company continues to pursue borrowing opportunities with large commercial U.S. and global banks, select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks.

There are no debt maturities for the remainder of 2024. The Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintain or improve its unsecured debt ratings.

## Credit Facility -

On September 9, 2024, Fitch Ratings assigned the Company a rating of A- for its senior unsecured debt, assigned a BBB credit rating for its preferred stock, and assigned its 'Stable' rating outlook. As a result, the Company achieved certain interest rate reductions and facility fee reduction for its Credit Facility and unsecured term loans.

The Company has a $2.0 billion Credit Facility with a group of banks. The Credit Facility is scheduled to expire in March 2027 with two additional six-month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company's discretion, to March 2028. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Parent Company. The Credit Facility can be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature. The Credit Facility is a green credit facility tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement. The Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate of Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the terms of the Credit Facility, plus 77.5 basis points and fluctuates in accordance with the Company's credit ratings. The interest rate can be further adjusted upward or downward based on the sustainability metric targets and the Company's credit rating outlook, as defined in the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Credit Facility is Adjusted Term SOFR plus 68.5 basis points (5.53% as of September 30, 2024) after reductions for sustainability metrics achieved and an upgraded credit rating profile.

## Term Loans -

The Company entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, through which the term loans assumed in connection with the RPT Merger were terminated (fully repaid) and new term loans were issued to replace the assumed loans. The new term loans retained the amounts and maturities of the assumed term loans, however, the rates (Adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.905% and fluctuate based on credit rating profile and achieving sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement) and covenants were revised to match those within the Company's Credit Facility. The following unsecured term loans were assumed, terminated and issued (dollars in millions):

The Term Loan Credit Facility accrues interest at a spread (currently 0.800% after reductions for sustainability metrics achieved and an upgraded credit rating profile) to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the credit agreement), that fluctuates in accordance with changes in Kimco's senior debt ratings. In addition, during the three months ended September 30 2024, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Facility, in separate transactions, to increase the aggregate principal amount from $200.0 million to $550.0 million. The additional $350.0 million is subject to the same terms as the existing Term Loan Credit Facility.

In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties to partially fund the capital needs of its real estate re-development and re-tenanting projects. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had over 525 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.

## Other -

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its remaining 14.2 million shares of ACI common stock held by the Company, generating net proceeds of $299.1 million. For tax purposes, the Company recognized a long-term capital gain of $288.7 million. The Company anticipates retaining the proceeds from this stock sale for general corporate purposes and, as a result, recorded federal and state income taxes of $72.9 million on the taxable gain.

The Parent Company guarantees the unsecured debt instruments of Kimco OP. These guarantees by the Parent Company are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of such unsecured debt instruments.

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the Company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. At September 30, 2024, these letters of credit aggregated $39.8 million.

The Company has investments with funding commitments of $27.5 million, of which $19.3 million has been funded as of September 30, 2024.

In connection with the construction of its development and redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of September 30, 2024, there were $16.2 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.

The Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency issued Series A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a development project in Sheridan, Colorado. These tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $41.0 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. The bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("PIF") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. The revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and PIF have satisfied the debt service requirements to date.

bonds, including principal and interest, are $4.5 million as of September 30, 2024. There have been no payments made by the Company under this guaranty agreement to date and the Company does not expect to make any payments over the life of the agreement.

## Dividends -

In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Company's Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as it monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio that reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid for common and preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $507.8 million and $446.6 million, respectively.

Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments with institutions that have high credit ratings. The Company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the Company's REIT taxable income distribution requirements. On July 30, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the Company's classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which were paid on October 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 1, 2024. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share which was paid on September 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on September 5, 2024.

On October 29, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the Company's classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which are scheduled to be paid on January 15, 2025, to shareholders of record on January 2, 2025. Additionally, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, representing a 4.2% increase from the prior quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable on December 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2024.

## Hurricane Impact -

The Company incurred no significant damage to its properties in September and October 2024 as a result of hurricanes Helene and Milton, which primarily hit Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.

## Funds From Operations

Funds From Operations ("FFO") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company's common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also made an election, in accordance with the NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper-2018 Restatement, to exclude from its calculation of FFO (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. As such, the Company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables, gains/impairments on other investments or other amounts considered incidental to its main business in NAREIT defined FFO.

The Company presents FFO available to the Company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO available to the Company's common shareholders when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of FFO available to the Company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.

FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

The Company's reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to FFO available to the Company's common shareholders is reflected in the table below (in thousands, except per share data).

## Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same property NOI")

Same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company included Same property NOI from the RPT properties acquired through the RPT Merger, as the Company owned these properties for the full three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The amount of the adjustment relating to RPT same property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, included in the table below, represents the Same property NOI from RPT properties prior to the RPT Merger, which is not included in the Company's Net income available to the Company's common shareholders.

Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, TIFs and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company's proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company's method of calculating Same property NOI available to the Company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

The following is a reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to Same property NOI (in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

| General and administrative | 33,850 | 33,697 | 103,238 | 101,180 |

| Equity in income of other investments, net | (216 ) | (2,100 ) | (9,468 ) | (8,741 ) |
| Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests | 2,443 | 2,551 | 6,693 | 9,208 |
| Preferred dividends, net | 7,961 | 6,285 | 23,864 | 18,736 |
| RPT same property NOI (1) | - | 42,893 | 610 | 121,761 |

| Same property NOI | $ 383,444 | $ 371,286 | $ 1,141,484 | $ 1,105,196 |

Same property NOI increased by $12.2 million, or 3.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $11.7 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in non-recoverable operating expenses of $0.5 million.

Same property NOI increased by $36.3 million, or 3.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $31.5 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in nonrecoverable operating expenses of $4.8 million.

## Leasing Activity

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company executed 1,205 leases totaling 8.0 million square feet in the Company's consolidated operating portfolio, comprised of 326 new leases and 879 renewals and options. The leasing costs associated with these new leases are estimated to aggregate $67.0 million, or $39.21 per square foot. These costs include $51.3 million of tenant improvements and $15.7 million of external leasing commissions. The average rent per square foot for (i) new leases was $22.97 and (ii) renewals and options was $19.44.

## Tenant Lease Expirations

At September 30, 2024, the Company has a total of 9,279 leases in its consolidated operating portfolio. The following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years, assuming no renewal options are exercised. For purposes of the table, the Total Annual Base Rent Expiring represents annualized rental revenue, excluding the impact of straight-line rent, for each lease that expires during the respective year. Amounts in thousands, except for number of leases data:

| Year Ending December 31, | Number of Leases Expiring | Square Feet Expiring | Total Annual Base Rent Expiring | % of Gross Annual Rent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) | 102 | 425 | 9,031 | 0.6 % |
| 2024 | 137 | 501 | 11,936 | 0.8 % |
| 2025 | 1,037 | 6,357 | 123,373 | 8.5 % |

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from time-totime, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 26 interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating to $860.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The hedged debt is reflected as fixed rate unsecured debt in the table below. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The following table presents the carrying value of the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding, including fair market value adjustments and unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 30, 2024, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. In addition, the following table presents the fair value of the Company's debt obligations outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. The table does not include extension options where available (amounts in millions).

| | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Thereafter | | Total | Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Secured Debt | | | | | | | | | |
| Fixed Rate | $ | - $ 49.7 | $ - | $ | 33.3 | $ 133.9 | $ 101.4 | $ 318.3 | $ 304.3 |
| Average Interest Rate | | - | 3.50 % | - | 4.01 % | 4.49 % | 3.82 % | 4.07 % | |
| Variable Rate | $ | - $ | 17.0 | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ 17.0 | $ 17.0 |
| Average Interest Rate | | - | 6.50 % | - | - | - | - | 6.50 % | |
| Unsecured Debt | | | | | | | | | |
| Fixed Rate | $ | - $ | 744.1 | $ 1,377.6 | $ 585.4 | $ 517.6 | $ 4,742.2 | $ 7,966.9 | $ 7,590.1 |
| Average Interest Rate | - | 3.48 % | 3.74 | % | 4.21 % | 2.55 % | 4.28 % | 3.86 % | |

Based on the Company's variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 if short-term interest rates were 1.0% higher.
