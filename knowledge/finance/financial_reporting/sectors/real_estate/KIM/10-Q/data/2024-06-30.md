## EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, of Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Company") and Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"). Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company's business was conducted through a predecessor entity also known as Kimco Realty Corporation (the "Predecessor"). On December 14, 2022, the Predecessor's Board of Directors approved the entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "UPREIT Merger") with the company formerly known as New KRC Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Predecessor (the "Parent Company"), and KRC Merger Sub Corp., which was a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company ("Merger Sub"), to effect the reorganization (the "Reorganization") of the Predecessor's business into an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or "UPREIT".

On January 1, 2023, pursuant to the UPREIT Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, and each outstanding share of capital stock of the Predecessor was converted into one equivalent share of capital stock of the Parent Company (each share of which has continued to trade under their respective existing ticker symbol with the same rights, powers and limitations that existed immediately prior to the Reorganization).

In connection with the Reorganization, the Parent Company changed its name to Kimco Realty Corporation, and replaced the Predecessor as the New York Stock Exchange-listed public company. Effective as of January 3, 2023, the Predecessor converted into a limited liability company, organized in the State of Delaware, known as Kimco Realty OP, LLC, the entity we refer to herein as "Kimco OP".

Following the Reorganization, substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP (either directly or through its subsidiaries), as the Company's operating company, and the Company is the managing member of Kimco OP. The officers and directors of the Company are the same as the officers and directors of the Predecessor immediately prior to the Reorganization.

The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is the managing member of Kimco OP. As of June 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

Stockholders' equity and members' capital are the primary areas of difference between the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of Kimco OP. Kimco OP's capital currently includes OP Units owned by the Parent and non-controlling OP Units owned by third parties. OP Units owned by third parties are accounted for within capital on Kimco OP's financial statements and in non-controlling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.

The Parent Company consolidates Kimco OP for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in Kimco OP. Therefore, while stockholders' equity, members' capital and noncontrolling interests differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and Kimco OP are the same on their respective financial statements.

- The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report provides the following benefits: ·Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and Kimco OP by enabling investors to view the businesses as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;
- ·Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation, because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and Kimco OP; and
- ·Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and Kimco OP, there are sections in this Quarterly Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and Kimco OP, including separate financial statements (but combined footnotes), separate controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and Kimco OP, unless context otherwise requires, this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings of the Parent Company and/or Kimco OP as being the actions or holdings of the Company (either directly or through its subsidiaries, including Kimco OP).

Throughout this Quarterly Report, unless the context requires otherwise:

·The "Company," "we," "our" or "us" refer to: othe Parent Company and its business and operations conducted through its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries, including Kimco OP; and oin statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to the Predecessor or Parent Company, as applicable.

- ·"Kimco OP" refers to Kimco Realty OP, LLC, our operating company following the UPREIT Merger.
- ·References to "shares" and "shareholders" refer to the shares and shareholders of the Parent Company and not the limited liability company interests of Kimco OP.

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Business and Organization

______________________________________________________________________

Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Parent Company") operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), of which substantially all of the Parent Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Parent Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco Realty OP, LLC ("Kimco OP"), either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Parent Company's operating company. The Parent Company is the managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of June 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP. The terms "Kimco", "the Company" and "our" each refer to the Parent Company and Kimco OP, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation.

The Company is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The Company's portfolio is primarily concentrated in the first-ring suburbs of the top major metropolitan markets, including those in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and rapidly expanding Sun Belt cities, with a tenant mix focused on essential, necessity-based goods and services that drive multiple shopping trips per week. The Company, its affiliates and related real estate joint ventures are engaged principally in the ownership, management, development and operation of open-air shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, which are anchored primarily by grocery stores, off-price retailers, discounters or service-oriented tenants. Additionally, the Company provides complementary services that capitalize on the Company's established retail real estate expertise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. The Company evaluates performance on a property specific or transactional basis and does not distinguish its principal business or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of measuring performance. Accordingly, the Company believes it has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").

The Company elected status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992 and operates in a manner that enables the Company to maintain its status as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, and is required to annually distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, including any net capital gains. In January 2023, the Company consummated the Reorganization into an UPREIT structure as described in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company, generally, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that have made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes on its income, and the Company includes, when applicable, a provision for taxes in its condensed consolidated financial statements.

## RPT Merger

On August 28, 2023, the Company and RPT Realty ("RPT") announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which the Company would acquire RPT through a series of mergers (collectively, the "RPT Merger"). On January 2, 2024, RPT merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company. The RPT Merger added 56 open-air shopping centers, 43 of which are wholly owned and 13 of which are owned through a joint venture, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). In addition, as a result of the RPT Merger, the Company obtained RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued share of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of the Company's newly issued 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Class N Preferred Stock").

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred expenses of $25.2 million associated with the RPT Merger, primarily comprised of severance, legal and professional fees. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

## Economic Conditions

The economy continues to face several issues including inflation risk, liquidity constraints, a lack of qualified employees, tenant bankruptcies and supply chain disruptions, which could impact the Company and its tenants. In response to the rising rate of inflation the Federal Reserve steadily increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and has kept them at increased levels. The Federal Reserve may continue to increase interest rates or maintain these increased levels, until the rate of inflation begins to decrease. These increased interest rates could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company's properties. Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

______________________________________________________________________

## Basis of Presentation

This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, of the Parent Company and Kimco OP into this single report. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and Kimco OP and their consolidated subsidiaries. The Reorganization resulted in a merger of entities under common control in accordance with GAAP. The Company's subsidiaries include subsidiaries which are wholly owned or which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE") in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The Parent Company serves as the general member of Kimco OP. The limited members of Kimco OP have limited rights over Kimco OP and do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Kimco OP's economic performance. As such, Kimco OP is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The information presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is unaudited and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented, and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Amounts as of December 31, 2023 included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of that date, but does not include all annual disclosures required by GAAP. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as certain disclosures in this Quarterly Report that would duplicate those included in such Annual Report on Form 10-K are not included in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 2, 2024, the Parent Company, as managing member of Kimco OP, entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Kimco OP (the "Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement"), providing for, among other things, the creation of Class N Preferred Units of Kimco OP, having the preferences, rights and limitations set forth therein, and certain modifications to the provisions regarding LTIP Units (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement), including provisions governing distribution and tax allocation requirements and the procedures for converting LTIP Units.

## Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

## Regulatory Update

On March 6, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted final rules that will require registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, including material climate-related risks and impacts, descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities, and any material climate-related targets or goals. The landmark rules also will require accelerated and large accelerated filers to disclose material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. These disclosures will be subject to independent third-party assurance. Registrants will also have to disclose, among other things, certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions and amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates in their audited financial statements. On March 15, 2024, a federal appellate court imposed a temporary stay pending judicial review of these new rules. The SEC voluntarily stayed its recently adopted climate disclosure rules pending the completion of judicial review. The Company plans to comply with the disclosure requirements of the final rules when they become effective, and are currently evaluating the impact these final rules will have on the Company's SEC filings and related disclosures.

The provisional fair market value of the acquired properties is based upon a valuation prepared by the Company with assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. The Company and valuation specialist are in the process of reviewing the assumptions and inputs used by the third-party specialist to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management's policy. Therefore, the final acquisition accounting adjustments, including the purchase price and its allocation, are not yet complete as of this filing. Once the purchase price and allocation are complete, an adjustment to the provisional purchase price or allocation may occur. Additionally, any excess purchase price, which could differ materially, may result in the recognition of goodwill, the amount of which may be significant.

The following table details the provisional weighted average useful lives, in years, of the purchase price provisionally allocated to real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities acquired arising from the RPT Merger:

| | Weighted Average Useful Life (in Years) |

The new term loans retained the amounts and maturities of the assumed term loans, however the rates (Adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.905% and tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement) and covenants were revised to match those within the Company's Credit Facility. In January 2024, the Company entered into swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the interest rates to fixed rates ranging from 4.674% to 4.875%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for interest rate swap disclosure.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") pursuant to a credit agreement, which matures in January 2026, with three one-year extension options. The Term Loan Credit Facility accrues interest at a spread (currently 0.850%) to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) or, at the Company's option, a spread (currently 0.000%) to a base rate defined in the credit agreement, that in each case fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Company's senior debt ratings. In January 2024, the Company entered into a swap rate agreement swapping the interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.572%. See Footnote 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for interest rate swap disclosure.

In July 2024, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from $200.0 million to $500.0 million. The additional $300.0 million is subject to the same terms as the existing Term Loan Credit Facility. The Company also entered into swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the interest rates to fixed rates ranging from 4.779% to 4.781%.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company fully repaid the following notes payables (dollars in millions):

| Type | Date Paid | Amount Repaid | Interest Rate | Maturity Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured note | Jan-24 | 246.2 | 4.45% | Jan-24 |
| Unsecured note | Mar-24 | 400 | 2.70% | Mar-24 |

## Mortgages Payable

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repaid $11.8 million of mortgage debt that encumbered three operating properties.

12. Derivatives

______________________________________________________________________

## Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risks primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company may use derivatives to manage exposures that arise from changes in interest rates and limits the risk by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into 21 interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating to $510.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued, as interest rates change, and recognized as interest expense in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. If the hedges are deemed to be effective, the fair value is included within the Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of June 30, 2024, all interest rate swaps were deemed effective and are therefore included within AOCI. As of June 30, 2024, the Company expects approximately $6.1 million of accumulated comprehensive income on derivative instruments to be reclassified into earnings as a reduction to interest expense during the next 12 months.

The interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company classifies the interest rate swaps as Level 2 and are measured on a recurring basis.

13. Noncontrolling Interests

______________________________________________________________________

Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates as a result of having a controlling interest or having determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of a VIE in accordance with the provisions of the FASB's Consolidation guidance. The Company accounts and reports for noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Consolidation guidance and the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance issued by the FASB. The Company identifies its noncontrolling interests separately within the equity section on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests are presented separately on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

In connection with the RPT Merger, the Parent Company issued 953,400 OP units in Kimco OP, which had a fair market value of $21.0 million. Upon consummation of the RPT Merger, the Parent Company owned 99.86% of the outstanding OP Units in Kimco OP, which is no longer a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Parent Company issued 326,140 long term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units") OP Units. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure. As of June 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding OP units in Kimco OP.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The Company owns eight shopping center properties located in Long Island, NY, which were acquired during 2022, partially through the issuance of $122.1 million of Preferred Outside Partner Units and $13.6 million of Common Outside Partner Units. The noncontrolling interest is classified as mezzanine equity and included in Redeemable noncontrolling interests on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of the put right available to the unit holders, an event that is not solely in the Company's control. During 2024, 101,369 Preferred Outside Partner Units and 3,441 Common Outside Partner Units were redeemed for cash of $2.1 million, in separate transactions. These transactions resulted in a net decrease in Redeemable noncontrolling interests of $1.3 million and a decrease in the embedded derivative liability in Other liabilities of $0.8 million on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2024, the Outside Partner Units related to these acquisitions total $93.0 million, including noncontrolling interests of $59.8 million and an embedded derivative liability associated with put and call options of these unitholders of $33.2 million. The Outside Partner Units related annual cash distribution rates and related conversion features consisted of the following as of June 30, 2024:

| Type | Par Value Per Unit Number of Units | Remaining | Return Per Annum | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preferred Outside Partner Units | 20 | 3,876,935 | 3.75% | |
| Common Outside Partner Units | 20 | 618,317 | Equal to the Company's common stock dividend | |

Included within noncontrolling interests are units that were determined to be contingently redeemable that are classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interests and presented in the mezzanine section between Total liabilities and Stockholders' equity on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the change in the redemption value of the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

14. Variable Interest Entities

______________________________________________________________________

## Consolidated Operating Properties

Included within the Company's operating properties at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are 30 consolidated entities, that are VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. These entities have been established to own and operate real estate property. The Company's involvement with these entities is through its majority ownership and management of the properties. The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. The Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as a result of its controlling financial interest. At June 30, 2024, total assets of these VIEs were $1.7 billion, and total liabilities were $167.9 million. At December 31, 2023, total assets of these VIEs were $1.8 billion, and total liabilities were $180.9 million.

The majority of the operations of these VIEs are funded with cash flows generated from the properties. The Company has not provided financial support to any of these VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide, which consists primarily of funding any capital expenditures, including tenant improvements, which are deemed necessary to continue to operate the entity and any operating cash shortfalls that the entity may experience.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

All liabilities of these consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Company ("VIE Liabilities"). The assets of the unencumbered VIEs are not restricted for use to settle only the obligations of these VIEs. The remaining VIE assets are encumbered by third-party non-recourse mortgage debt. The assets associated with these encumbered VIEs ("Restricted Assets") are collateral under the respective mortgages and are therefore restricted and can only be used to settle the corresponding liabilities of the VIE. The table below summarizes the consolidated VIEs and the classification of the Restricted Assets and VIE Liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, exclusive of Kimco OP, as follows (dollars in millions):

| | As of June 30, 2024 | As of December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of unencumbered VIEs | 28 | 28 |
| Number of encumbered VIEs | 2 | 2 |

| Real estate, net | 324.1 | $ 379.8 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 2.8 | 3.9 |
| Accounts and notes receivable, net | 2.2 | 3.6 |

| Total VIE Liabilities | 167.9 | $ 180.9 |

## Unconsolidated Redevelopment Investment

Included in the Company's preferred equity investments at June 30, 2024, is an unconsolidated development project which is a VIE for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. This preferred equity investment was primarily established to develop real estate property for long-term investment and was deemed a VIE primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support. The initial equity contributed to this entity was not sufficient to fully finance the real estate construction as development costs are funded by the partners over the construction period. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on the fact that the Company has shared control of this entity along with the entity's partners and therefore does not have a controlling financial interest.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company's investment in this VIE was $36.6 million, which is included in Other investments on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this VIE is the Company's carrying value in this investment. The Company has not provided financial support to this VIE that it was not previously contractually required to provide. All future costs of development will be funded with construction loan financing or capital contributions from the Company and the outside partner in accordance with their respective ownership percentages if necessary.

15. Fair Value Measurements

______________________________________________________________________

All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies, reasonably approximate their fair values, except those listed below, for which fair values are disclosed. The valuation method used to estimate fair value for fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, and mortgage and other finance receivables, is based on discounted cash flow analyses, with assumptions that include credit spreads, market yield curves, trading activity, loan amounts and debt maturities. The fair values for marketable securities are based on published values, securities dealers' estimated market values or comparable market sales. The fair value for embedded derivative liability is based on using the "with-and-without" method. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.

## KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND KIMCO REALTY OP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

The following are financial instruments for which the Company's estimated fair value differs from the carrying amount (in thousands):

| | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Mortgage and other financing receivables (1) | Level 3 | $ 469,694 | $ 460,853 | $ 130,745 | $ 122,323 |
| Liabilities: | | | | | |
| Notes payable, net (2) | | | | | |
| Senior unsecured notes | Level 2 | $ 6,614,230 | $ 5,943,296 | $ 7,262,851 | $ 6,671,450 |
| Term loans | Level 3 | $ 508,774 | $ 510,216 | $ - | $ - |
| Credit facility | Level 3 | $ 214,249 | $ 220,655 | $ - | $ - |
| Mortgages payable, net (3) | Level 3 | $ 337,456 | $ 312,653 | $ 353,945 | $ 329,955 |

The Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the FASB's Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance, including available for sale securities, interest rate swaps and embedded derivative liabilities. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

The tables below present the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregated by the level of the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):

| | Balance at June 30, 2024 | | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assets: | | | | |
| Marketable equity securities | $ | 1,612 | $ - | $ - |
| Interest rate swaps derivative assets | $ | 7,820 | $ 7,820 | $ - |
| Liabilities: | | | | |

| Liabilities: | | | | | |
| Embedded derivative liability | $ 30,914 | - | $ | - | $ 30,914 |

The significant unobservable input (Level 3 inputs) used in measuring the Company's embedded derivative liability, which is categorized with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is the discount rate of 6.50% and 6.40% as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges related to adjustments to property carrying values of $3.9 million and $11.8 million, respectively. The Company's estimated fair values of these assets were primarily based upon estimated sales prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, which were less than the carrying value of the assets. The Company does not have access to the unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair values of third-party offers. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of these investments was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

16. Incentive Plans

______________________________________________________________________

The Company has an Equity Participation Plan (as amended and/or restated, the "Equity Plan"), which provides for a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be reserved for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents, LTIP Units, stock payments and deferred stock awards. At June 30, 2024, the Company had 3.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the Equity Plan.

The Company accounts for equity awards in accordance with FASB's compensation - Stock Compensation guidance, which requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and LTIP Units, be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the service period based on their fair values. Fair value of performance awards is determined using the Monte Carlo method, which is intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Fair value of restricted shares is calculated based on the price on the date of grant.

The Company recognized expenses associated with its equity awards of $18.3 million and $17.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $62.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock compensation granted under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.9 years.

## Restricted Stock

Information with respect to restricted stock under the Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

## Time-Based LTIP Units

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company granted to certain employees and directors 120,700 LTIP Units with time-based vesting requirements ("TimeBased LTIP Units") and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $19.47 per unit that vest ratably over five years subject to continued employment. Compensation expense for these units is being recognized over a five-year period.

The aggregate grant-date fair value of the Time-Based LTIP Units for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $2.4 million. Granted Time-Based LTIP Units do not have redemption rights, but any OP Units into which units are converted are entitled to redemption rights. The Time-Based LTIPs were valued based on the Company's closing common share price on the date of grant.

## Performance-Based LTIP Units

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company granted to certain employees 205,440 LTIP Units with performance-based vesting requirements ("Performance-Based LTIP Units") and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $18.14 per unit.

19. Commitments and Contingencies

______________________________________________________________________

## Letters of Credit

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with the completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the Company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. At June 30, 2024, these letters of credit aggregated $39.8 million.

## Funding Commitments

The Company has investments with funding commitments of $27.5 million, of which $17.8 million has been funded as of June 30, 2024.

## Other

The Parent Company guarantees the unsecured debt instruments of Kimco OP. These guarantees by the Parent Company are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of such unsecured debt instruments.

In connection with the construction of its development and redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of June 30, 2024, there were $16.4 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.

The Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency issued Series A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a development project in Sheridan, Colorado. These tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $41.0 million outstanding at June 30, 2024. The bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("PIF") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts the Company may have to provide under a guaranty. The revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and PIF have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. The incremental taxes and PIF are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.

In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the City of Jacksonville Series 2005A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a redevelopment project in Jacksonville, FL. Repayment of the bonds is to be made in accordance with a level-payment amortization schedule over 20 years, and repayments are made out of tax revenues generated by the redevelopment. The remaining debt service payments due over the life of the bonds, including principal and interest, are $4.5 million as of June 30, 2024. There have been no payments made by the Company under this guaranty agreement to date and the Company does not expect to make any payments over the life of the agreement.

The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company taken as a whole as of June 30, 2024.

## Executive Overview

Kimco Realty Corporation is a REIT, of which substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and substantially all of the Company's operations are conducted through, Kimco OP, either directly or through its subsidiaries, as the Company's operating company. The Company is the managing member and exercises exclusive control over Kimco OP. As of June 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned 99.84% of the outstanding limited liability company interests (the "OP Units") in Kimco OP.

The Company is North America's largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and a growing portfolio of mixed-use assets. The terms "Kimco," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" each refers to Kimco Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The Company's mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders.

The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") and has owned and operated open-air shopping centers for over 60 years. The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had interests in 567 U.S. shopping center properties, aggregating 100.6 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), located in 30 states. In addition, the Company had 67 other property interests, primarily including net leased properties, preferred equity investments, and other investments, totaling 5.3 million square feet of GLA. The Company's ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company's investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.

The Company's primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, and a growing portfolio of mixeduse assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by:

- ·increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;
- ·increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios;
- ·maintaining strong debt metrics and our BBB+/Baa1 unsecured debt ratings;
- ·continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and
- ·increasing the number of entitlements for residential use.

## RPT Merger

On January 2, 2024, RPT Realty merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") between the Company and RPT, which was entered into on August 28, 2023. As a result of the RPT Merger, the Company acquired 56 open-air shopping centers, including 43 wholly-owned and 13 joint venture assets, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, to the Company's existing portfolio. The Company also obtained RPT's 6% stake in a 49-property net lease joint venture.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each RPT common share was converted into 0.6049 of a newly issued share of the Company's common stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each 7.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Share of RPT was converted into the right to receive one depositary share representing one one-thousandth of a share of the Company's 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Class N Preferred Stock"). In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company issued 53.0 million shares of common stock, 1,849 shares of Class N Preferred Stock, and 953,400 OP Units. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the RPT Merger.

## Economic Conditions

The economy continues to face several issues, including inflation risk, liquidity constraints, the lack of qualified employees, tenant bankruptcies and supply chain disruptions, which could impact the Company and its tenants. In response to the rising rate of inflation, the Federal Reserve steadily increased interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and has kept them at increased levels. The Federal Reserve may continue to increase interest rates or maintain these increased levels, until the rate of inflation begins to decrease. These increased interest rates could adversely impact the business and financial results of the Company and its tenants. In addition, slower economic growth and the potential for a recession could have an adverse effect on the Company and its tenants. This could negatively affect the overall demand for retail space, including the demand for leasable space in the Company's properties.

Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company continues to monitor economic, financial, and social conditions and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. If the Company determines that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material.

## Effects of Inflation

Many of the Company's long-term leases contain provisions designed to help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or as a result of escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. To assist in partially mitigating the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting from inflation, the Company's leases include provisions that either (i) require the tenant to pay an allocable share of these operating expenses or (ii) contain fixed contractual amounts, which include escalation clauses, to reimburse these operating expenses.

## Results of Operations

## Credit Facility -

In February 2023, the Company obtained a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which replaced the Company's existing $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in March 2024. The Credit Facility is scheduled to expire in March 2027 with two additional six-month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company's discretion, to March 2028. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Parent Company. The Credit Facility can be increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature. The Credit Facility is a green credit facility tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement. The Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate of Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the terms of the Credit Facility, plus 77.5 basis points and fluctuates in accordance with the Company's credit ratings. The interest rate can be further adjusted upward or downward by a maximum of four basis points based on the sustainability metric targets, as defined in the agreement. The interest rate on the Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024 was 6.19% after a two-basis point reduction was achieved. As of June 30, 2024, the Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $220.0 million and no appropriations for letters of credit.

Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company, among other things, is subject to maintenance of various covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with these covenants. The financial covenants for the Credit Facility are as follows:

| Covenant | Must Be | As of June 30, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value ("GAV") | \<60% | 35% |
| Total Priority Indebtedness to GAV | \<35% | 1% |
| Unencumbered Asset Net Operating Income to Total Unsecured Interest Expense | >1.75x | 4.5x |
| Fixed Charge Total Adjusted EBITDA to Total Debt Service | >1.50x | 4.0x |

## Term Loans -

The Company entered into a Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, through which the term loans assumed in connection with the RPT Merger were terminated and new term loans were issued to replace the assumed loans. The new term loans retained the amounts and maturities of the assumed term loans, however, the rates (Adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.905% and tied to sustainability metric targets, as described in the agreement) and covenants were revised to match those within the Company's Credit Facility. The following unsecured term loans were assumed, terminated and issued (dollars in millions):

| Type | Date Paid | Amount Repaid | Interest Rate | Maturity Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured term loan | Jan-24 | 50 | 4.15% | Nov-26 |
| Unsecured term loan | Jan-24 | 100 | 4.11% | Feb-27 |
| Unsecured term loan | Jan-24 | 50 | 3.43% | Aug-27 |
| Unsecured term loan | Jan-24 | 110 | 3.71% | Feb-28 |

On January 2, 2024, Kimco OP entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured term loan credit facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") pursuant to a credit agreement, among Kimco OP, TD Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto. The Term Loan Credit Facility accrues interest at a spread (currently 0.850%) to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) or, at Kimco OP's option, a spread (currently 0.000%) to a base rate defined in the credit agreement, that, in each case, fluctuates in accordance with changes in Kimco's senior debt ratings. In January 2024, the Company entered into a swap rate agreement swapping the interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.572%.

In July 2024, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from $200.0 million to $500.0 million. The additional $300.0 million is subject to the same terms as the existing Term Loan Credit Facility. The Company also entered into swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the interest rates to fixed rates ranging from 4.779% to 4.781%.

In January 2024, the Company entered into 20 swap rate agreements with various lenders swapping the interest rates to fixed rates ranging from 4.674% to 4.875%.

## Mortgages Payable -

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repaid $11.8 million of mortgage debt that encumbered three operating properties.

In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties to partially fund the capital needs of its real estate re-development and re-tenanting projects. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had over 525 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.

## Other -

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold its remaining 14.2 million shares of ACI common stock held by the Company, generating net proceeds of $299.1 million. For tax purposes, the Company recognized a long-term capital gain of $288.7 million. The Company anticipates retaining the proceeds from this stock sale for general corporate purposes and, as a result, recorded federal and state income taxes of $72.9 million on the taxable gain.

The Parent Company guarantees the unsecured debt instruments of Kimco OP. These guarantees by the Parent Company are full, irrevocable, unconditional and absolute joint and several guarantees to the holders of each series of such unsecured debt instruments.

The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees, primarily on certain of the Company's redevelopment projects and guaranty of payment related to the Company's insurance program. At June 30, 2024, these letters of credit aggregated $39.8 million.

The Company has investments with funding commitments of $27.5 million, of which $17.8 million has been funded as of June 30, 2024.

In connection with the construction of its development and redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the Company's obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of June 30, 2024, there were $16.4 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.

The Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the Sheridan Redevelopment Agency issued Series A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a development project in Sheridan, Colorado. These tax increment revenue bonds have a balance of $41.0 million outstanding at June 30, 2024. The bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee ("PIF") to be assessed on current and future retail sales and, to the extent necessary, any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty. The revenue generated from incremental sales, property taxes and PIF have satisfied the debt service requirements to date. The incremental taxes and PIF are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or 2040.

In connection with the RPT Merger, the Company provides a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on the City of Jacksonville Series 2005A bonds, which are tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with a redevelopment project in Jacksonville, FL. Repayment of the bonds is to be made in accordance with a level-payment amortization schedule over 20 years, and repayments are made out of tax revenues generated by the redevelopment. The remaining debt service payments due over the life of the bonds, including principal and interest, are $4.5 million as of June 30, 2024. There have been no payments made by the Company under this guaranty agreement to date and the Company does not expect to make any payments over the life of the agreement.

## Dividends -

In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. The Company's Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as it monitors sources of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a dividend payout ratio that reserves such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid for common and preferred stock for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $338.1 million and $297.7 million, respectively.

Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments with institutions that have high credit ratings. The Company's objective is to establish a dividend level that maintains compliance with the Company's REIT taxable income distribution requirements. On April 30, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend with respect to the Company's classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which were paid on July 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on July 1, 2024. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share which was paid on June 20, 2024 to shareholders of record on June 6, 2024.

On July 30, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends with respect to the Company's classes of preferred shares (Classes L, M and N), which are scheduled to be paid on October 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 1, 2024. Additionally, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share, payable on September 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on September 5, 2024.

## Funds From Operations

Funds From Operations ("FFO") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company's common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also made an election, in accordance with the NAREIT Funds From Operations White Paper-2018 Restatement, to exclude from its calculation of FFO (i) gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business and (ii) mark-to-market changes in the value of its equity securities. As such, the Company does not include gains/impairments on land parcels, mark-to-market gains/losses from marketable securities, allowance for credit losses on mortgage receivables, gains/impairments on other investments or other amounts considered incidental to its main business in NAREIT defined FFO.

The Company presents FFO available to the Company's common shareholders as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO available to the Company's common shareholders when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of FFO available to the Company's common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.

FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore, should not be considered an alternative for net income or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity.

The Company's reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to FFO available to the Company's common shareholders is reflected in the table below (in thousands, except per share data).

Accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted FFO per share calculations.

## Same Property Net Operating Income ("Same property NOI")

Same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company included Same property NOI from the RPT properties acquired through the RPT Merger, as the Company owned these properties for the full three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The amount of the adjustment relating to RPT same property NOI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, included in the table below, represents the Same property NOI from RPT properties prior to the RPT Merger, which is not included in the Company's Net income available to the Company's common shareholders.

Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, TIFs and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for credit losses, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company's proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company's method of calculating Same property NOI available to the Company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

The following is a reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to Same property NOI (in thousands):

| | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |

| Preferred dividends, net | 7,961 | 6,200 | 15,903 | 12,451 |
| RPT same property NOI (1) | - | 38,358 | 610 | 78,597 |
| Non same property net operating income | (10,192 ) | (13,843 ) | (25,213 ) | (28,815 ) |
| Non-operational expense from joint ventures, net | 28,278 | 22,766 | 57,400 | 38,805 |
| Same property NOI | $ 377,677 | $ 366,578 | $ 758,785 | $ 733,665 |

Same property NOI increased by $11.1 million, or 3.0%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $11.4 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in nonrecoverable operating expenses of $1.9 million, partially offset by (iii) an increase in credit losses from tenants of $2.2 million due to increased collections.

Same property NOI increased by $25.1 million, or 3.4%, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is primarily the result of (i) a net increase of $21.8 million, primarily related to an increase in rental revenue

driven by strong leasing activity and (ii) a decrease in non-recoverable operating expenses of $4.3 million, partially offset by (iii) an increase in credit losses from tenants of $1.0 million due to increased collections.

## Leasing Activity

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company executed 845 leases totaling 5.9 million square feet in the Company's consolidated operating portfolio comprised of 231 new leases and 614 renewals and options. The leasing costs associated with these new leases are estimated to aggregate $48.7 million, or $40.83 per square foot. These costs include $37.8 million of tenant improvements and $10.9 million of external leasing commissions. The average rent per square foot for (i) new leases was $22.45 and (ii) renewals and options was $19.02.

## Tenant Lease Expirations

At June 30, 2024, the Company has a total of 9,276 leases in its consolidated operating portfolio. The following table sets forth the aggregate lease expirations for each of the next ten years, assuming no renewal options are exercised. For purposes of the table, the Total Annual Base Rent Expiring represents annualized rental revenue, excluding the impact of straight-line rent, for each lease that expires during the respective year. Amounts in thousands, except for number of leases data:

| Year Ending December 31, | Number of Leases Expiring | Square Feet Expiring | Total Annual Base Rent Expiring | % of Gross Annual Rent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) | 144 | 638 | 13,221 | 0.9 % |
| 2024 | 296 | 1,271 | 28,512 | 2.0 % |

(1)Leases currently under month-to-month lease or in process of renewal.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from time-totime, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has 21 interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating to $510.0 million. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are held by the Company to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt. The hedged debt is reflected as fixed rate unsecured debt in the table below. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The following table presents the carrying value of the Company's aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding, including fair market value adjustments and unamortized deferred financing costs, as of June 30, 2024, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. In addition, the following table presents the fair value of the Company's debt obligations outstanding, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. The table does not include extension options where available (amounts in millions).

| | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Thereafter | Total | Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Secured Debt | | | | | | | | |
| Fixed Rate | $ - | $ 50.2 | $ - | $ 33.5 | $ 135.3 | $ 101.3 | $ 320.3 | $ 295.6 |
| Average Interest Rate | - | 3.50 % | - | 4.01 % | 4.50 % | 3.82 % | 4.07 % | |

| Average Interest Rate | - | - | - | 6.19 % | - | - | 6.19 % | |

Based on the Company's variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 if short-term interest rates were 1.0% higher.
