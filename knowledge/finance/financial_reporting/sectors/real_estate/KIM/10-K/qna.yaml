  - context: >
      Kimco Realty is the nation's largest owner and operator of open-air
      shopping centers, with a strong focus on geographic and tenant
      diversification. As of December 31, 2023, no single shopping center
      accounted for more than 1.3% of annualized base rental revenues, and the
      company's five largest tenants represented less than 11.3% of annualized
      base rental revenues.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the key aspects of Kimco's portfolio diversification strategy?
        answer: Kimco maintains a highly diversified portfolio through two main
          approaches 1) Geographic distribution of properties across the United
          States, with no single shopping center accounting for more than 1.3%
          of annualized base rental revenues, and 2) A diverse tenant base where
          the five largest tenants combined represent less than 11.3% of
          annualized base rental revenues. This diversification helps reduce
          operating and leasing risks while ensuring stable income streams.
      - question: How does Kimco's tenant mix contribute to portfolio stability?
        answer: Kimco's tenant mix strategy focuses on maintaining a balanced portfolio
          of retailers, with no single tenant dominating the revenue stream. The
          company's largest tenant represents only 3.7% of annualized base
          rental revenues, demonstrating strong tenant diversification. This
          approach helps mitigate tenant-specific risks and ensures stable cash
          flows across the portfolio.
      - question: What competitive advantages does Kimco derive from its market
          leadership position?
        answer: As the nation's largest owner and operator of open-air shopping centers,
          Kimco benefits from economies of scale, strong market presence, and
          significant bargaining power with tenants. Their scale allows them to
          optimize operating costs, implement best practices across the
          portfolio, and maintain strong relationships with national and
          regional retailers through their broad network of industry contacts.
