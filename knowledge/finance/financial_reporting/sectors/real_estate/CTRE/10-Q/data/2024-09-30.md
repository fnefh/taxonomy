<h2>1. ORGANIZATION</h2>

As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned, directly or through joint ventures, and leased to independent operators 226 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 24,512 operational beds and units located in 31 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California and Texas. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had other real estate related investments consisting of three preferred equity investments, 12 real estate secured loans receivable andfour mezzanine loans receivable with a carrying value of $740.7 million.</p>
<h2>2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<p>Basis of Presentation -The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for a complete set of annual audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CareTrust REIT, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.</p>
<p>Transfers of financial assets -The Company accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when it has surrendered control over the related assets. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other things, an evaluation of relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred. Transfers of financial assets that do not qualify for sale accounting are reported as collateralized borrowings. Accordingly, the related assets remain on the Company's balance sheet and continue to be reported and accounted for as if the transfer had not occurred. Cash proceeds from these transfers are reported as liabilities, with attributable interest expense recognized over the life of the related transactions.</p>

<p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized aggregate impairment charges of $8.4 million and $36.9 million, respectively, related to properties held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated income statements.

<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined thattwo facilities held for sale no longer met the criteria to be held for sale and were reclassified as held for investment. As of September 30, 2024, there were 8 facilities classified as held for sale, all of which have been marked down to fair value less estimated costs to sell.</p>
<p>The fair values of the assets held for sale were based on estimated sales prices, which are considered to be Level 3 (as defined below) measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Estimated sales prices were determined using a market approach (comparable sales model), which relies on certain assumptions by management, including: (i) comparable market transactions, (ii) estimated prices per unit, and (iii) binding agreements for sales and non-binding offers to purchase from unrelated third-parties. There are inherent uncertainties in making these assumptions. For the Company's impairment calculations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $5,000 to $94,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $36,000. For the Company's impairment calculations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $18,000 to $35,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $23,000.</p>
<h2>Impairment of Real Estate Investments Held for Investment</h2>
<p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.0 million related to one SNF. The Company wrote down its carrying value of $8.7 million to its estimated fair value of $0.7 million as of September 30, 2023, which is included in real estate investments, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the asset was based on comparable market transactions and considered Level 3 (as defined below) measurements within the fair value hierarchy. For the Company's impairment calculation, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized a price per unit of $7,000.</p>
<h2>Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications</h2>

<h2>6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. GAAP guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:</p>
<p>Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.</p>
<p>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.</p>
<p>The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and, depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. The Company does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.</p>

<p>Real estate secured and mezzanine loans receivable: The fair values of the secured and mezzanine loans receivables were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value, market interest rates and other credit enhancements. As such, the Company classifies each instrument as Level 3 due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining market interest rates for investments with similar terms. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $5.9 million, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $4.1 million, on its secured and mezzanine loans receivable to bring the interest rates in line with market rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized losses on its secured and mezzanine loans receivable of $7.3 million, which were partially offset by unrealized gains of $6.6 million, to bring the interest rates in line with market rates. Future changes in market interest rates or collateral value could materially impact the estimated discounted cash flows that are used to determine the fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any loans that were 90 days or more past due.</p>

<p>On December 16, 2022, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, the Company, as guarantor, CareTrust GP, LLC, and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2023, the Operating Partnership, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries and KeyBank National Association entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.</p>
<p>The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value</p>

<p>ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based on the credit ratings of the Company's senior long-term unsecured debt).</p>
<p>On September 19, 2024 (the "Prepayment Date"), the Company elected to prepay all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of their outstanding Term Loan. The Term Loan was prepaid at the principal amount of the Term Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the Prepayment Date. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of the Term Loan. As of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.</p>
<p>The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at the sole discretion of the Operating Partnership,two six-month extension options. Prior to prepayment, the Term Loan had a maturity date of February 8, 2026.</p>
<p>The Second Amended Credit Facility is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (other than the Operating Partnership). The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend organizational documents and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. The Second Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum debt to asset value ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum cash distributions to operating income ratio, a maximum secured debt to asset value ratio, a maximum secured recourse debt to asset value ratio, a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered properties asset value ratio, a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and a minimum rent coverage ratio. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments under the Second Amended Credit Facility or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants (including the financial maintenance covenants), the occurrence of change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.</p>
<h2>Secured Borrowing</h2>
<p>On June 3, 2024, KeyBank National Association purchased a $75.0 million undivided participation interest in a $165.0 million mortgage loan from the Company (see Note 5, Other Real Estate Related and Other Investments , for additional information), which bore interest at a rate of SOFR, with a term SOFR floor of3.00%, plus 2.5% or 2.25%, depending on the debt yield of the loan, and payable monthly. As the transaction did not qualify as a sale in accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded the participation interest as a secured borrowing in the amount of $75.0 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The participating interest could be p repaid in whole before the maturity date for an exit fee of up to 0.50% of the loan plus unpaid interest. Th e participation interest provided for a put option, subject to certain restrictions, and a call option for the then-outstanding loan amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On July 30, 2024, the Company exercised the call option on the $75.0 million secured borrowing and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million related to the exit fee. The exit fee is included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated income statements.</p>

<h2>9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</h2>
<p>All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units, relative total stockholder return based stock awards and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. Under the Plan, 5,000,000 shares have been authorized for awards.</p>

<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<p>Under the Plan, restricted stock awards ("RSAs") vest in equal annual installments over athree year period for the RSAs granted after 2020 and afour year period for the RSAs granted in 2020. RSAs granted to nonemployee members of the board of directors ("Board Awards") vest in full on the earlier to occur of the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or one year. Performance stock awards ("PSAs") granted were subject to both time and performance based conditions and vested over a one-to-three year period for PSAs granted in 2021 and over aone-to-four year period for PSAs granted in 2020. The amount of such PSAs that ultimately vested was dependent on the Company's Normalized Funds from Operations ("NFFO") per share, as defined by the Compensation Committee, meeting or exceeding a specified per share amount for the applicable vesting period. Relative total shareholder return units ("TSR Units") granted are subject to both time and market based conditions and cliff vest after a three-year period. The amount of such market awards that will ultimately vest is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to a custom TSR peer group consisting of other publicly traded healthcare REITs and will range from 0% to 200% of the TSR Units initially granted. The RSAs and Board Awards are valued on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company's common stock, while the TSR Units are valued on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The vesting of certain awards may accelerate, as defined in the grant agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other events.</p>

<h2>12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<p>The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, which are not individually or in the aggregate anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against the Company's tenants, which are the responsibility of the Company's tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.</p>

<h2>14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</h2>
<p>The Company evaluates subsequent events in accordance with ASC 855, Subsequent Events . The Company evaluates subsequent events up until the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.</p>
<h2>Recent Acquisitions</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2024, the Company acquired two SNFs and one multi-service campus in Maryland for $55.5 million, which includes estimated capitalized acquisition costs. In connection with the acquisition of the facilities, the Company entered into a new master lease with a skilled nursing operator. The new master lease has an initial term of approximately 15 years, with two five-year renewal options and CPI-based rent escalators. Initial annual cash rent under the new master lease is $5.2 million.</p>
<h2>Recent Investments</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2024, and in connection with the $55.5 million skilled nursing acquisition described above, the Company extended a $19.2 million mortgage loan to a skilled nursing operator. The loan is secured by a first priority ground leasehold mortgage lien on a SNF located in Maryland and bears interest at an initial annual rate of 9.35% with annual CPI-based escalators, payable monthly. The mortgage loan has a term of15 years and is set to mature on September 30, 2039, with two five-year extension options. The mortgage loan provides for a put option, giving the borrower the right to require the lender to purchase the underlying ground leasehold and property associated with the mortgage loan. The exercise window for the put option is 30 days prior to the maturity date. The mortgage loan also provides for a purchase option in favor of the Company (subject to certain requirements) withtwo exercise windows. The first exercise window is on or before October 1, 2026. The second purchase option window opens January 1, 2039, and remains open for 6 months.</p>
<p>On October 1, 2024, the Company extended a $9.8 million mortgage loan to a skilled nursing real estate owner. The loan is secured by a first priority mortgage lien on a SNF located in Colorado and bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.5%, payable monthly. The mortgage loan is set to mature on September 30, 2034. The mortgage provides aone-year extension option and may (subject to certain restrictions) be prepaid in whole, after the 18th month following the loan closing, for an exit fee ranging from 0% to 2% of the loan plus unpaid interest payments.</p>
<h2>Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2024, in connection with a joint venture arrangement (the "Tennessee JV") between the Operating Partnership and an unaffiliated third party, the Operating Partnership became bound by the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Tennessee JV has agreed to acquire 31 skilled nursing facilities (the "Tennessee SNF Facilities") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $500 million, exclusive of transaction costs. In connection with the Tennessee JV's acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities, the Operating Partnership is expected to</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<p>contribute approximately $442 million toward the aggregate purchase price to the Tennessee JV and, in exchange, the Operating Partnership will own100% of the preferred equity ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing 92.5% of the total investment and 50% of the common ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing3.75% of the total investment. The Tennessee SNF Facilities consist of a total of 3,290 licensed beds, with 30 of the facilities located in Tennessee and one in Alabama. The Company has contributed $8.5 million to the Tennessee JV, which was used to partially fund the earnest money deposit under the Purchase Agreement.</p>
<p>Completion of the Tennessee JV's acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in two phases during December 2024. At closing, the Tennessee SNF Facilities are anticipated to be operated by affiliates of PACS Group, Inc. (twelve facilities), Ensign (nine facilities), and Links Healthcare Group (seven facilities), who are all current tenants of the Company, as well asone new operator relationship (three facilities), under long-term master leases. Three of Ensign's nine facilities will be acquired by Ensign's real estate subsidiary with the remaining six to be included in a new master lease. Initial annual base rent to the Tennessee JV relating to the Tennessee SNF Facilities is expected to aggregate approximately $44.4 million.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CareTrust REIT is a self-administered, publicly-traded REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, financing, development and leasing of skilled nursing, seniors housing and other healthcare-related properties. As of September 30, 2024, we owned, directly or indirectly through joint ventures, and leased to independent operators 226 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 24,512 operational beds and units located in 31 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California and Texas. As of September 30, 2024, we also had other real estate related investments consisting of three preferred equity investments, 12 real estate secured loans receivable and four mezzanine loans receivable with a carrying value of $740.7 million.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h2>Market Trends and Uncertainties</h2>
<p>Recent macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation (including higher supply costs), elevated interest rates and related changes to consumer spending, including, but not limited to, causing individuals to delay or defer moves to seniors housing, has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our tenants' ability to meet some of their financial</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>obligations to us. Higher interest rates have also increased our costs of capital to finance acquisitions and increased our borrowing costs. We continue to monitor changes in the interest rate environment and the effect of changing rates on our business. In addition, current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting market volatility may adversely impact our ability to sell properties on acceptable terms, if at all, which could result in additional impairment charges.</p>
<p>As a result of the above factors, our tenants are continuing to experience elevated operating costs at their facilities. At a portfolio wide level, occupancy levels at our seniors housing facilities, comprising our ALFs and ILFs, continue to remain below occupancy levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within our SNFs, occupancy levels have continued to improve since their trough in January 2021 and have reached or exceeded occupancy levels prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, for most of our tenants.</p>
<p>As a result of impacts experienced by our operators since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to recent market trends and uncertainties, the ability of some of our tenants and borrowers to meet their financial obligations to us in full has been negatively impacted. From time to time in the past, we have taken actions to reposition one or more properties with a replacement tenant or sell the property and, in certain cases, we have also restructured tenants' long-term obligations. See "Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Asset Sales" below. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 98.7% of contractual rents and interest due from our operators and borrowers excluding cash deposits. In the event our tenants or borrowers are unable to satisfy their obligations to us and we are unable to effect these actions on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place, our rental and interest income would be adversely impacted and we may incur additional expenses or obligations and be required to recognize additional impairment charges or fair value adjustments.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Updates</h2>
<p>On October 13, 2023, California Senate Bill No. 525 ("SB 525") was signed into law, requiring a substantial increase in the minimum wage for workers operating in certain health care facilities. As a result of SB 525, certain health care facilities (including licensed skilled nursing facilities) operating in California are required to increase the wages of their covered health care employees to at least $21 per hour, which was initially required to be effective from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026, $22 or $23 per hour (depending on facility type) from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028, and $25 per hour after June 1, 2028. After the initial implementation was delayed by the Governor of California in June 2024, SB 525 went into effect on October 16, 2024.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") issued a final rule on July 31, 2024, updating Medicare payment policies and rates for SNFs for fiscal year 2025. This update includes a 4.2% increase in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs, totaling approximately $1.4 billion. These increases are expected to partially offset some of our tenants' higher operating costs.</p>
<p>On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse's aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants.</p>

<h2>Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2024, in connection with a joint venture arrangement (the "Tennessee JV") between the Operating Partnership and an unaffiliated third party, the Operating Partnership became bound by the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Tennessee JV has agreed to acquire 31 skilled nursing facilities (the "Tennessee SNF Facilities") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $500 million, exclusive of transaction costs. In connection with the Tennessee JV's acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities, the Operating Partnership is expected to contribute approximately $442 million toward the aggregate purchase price to the Tennessee JV and, in exchange, the Operating Partnership will own 100% of the preferred equity ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing 92.5% of the total investment and 50% of the common ownership interests in the Tennessee JV representing 3.75% of the total investment. The Tennessee SNF Facilities consist of a total of 3,290 licensed beds, with 30 of the facilities located in Tennessee and one in Alabama. We contributed $8.5 million to the Tennessee JV, which was used to partially fund the earnest money deposit under the Purchase Agreement.</p>
<p>Completion of the Tennessee JV's acquisition of the Tennessee SNF Facilities is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in two phases during December 2024. At closing, the Tennessee SNF Facilities are anticipated to be operated by affiliates of PACS Group, Inc. (twelve facilities), The Ensign Group (nine facilities), and Links Healthcare Group (seven facilities), who are all current tenants of ours, as well as one new operator relationship (three facilities), under long-term master leases. Three of Ensign's nine facilities will be acquired by Ensign's real estate subsidiary with the remaining six to be included in a new master lease. Initial annual base rent to the Tennessee JV relating to the Tennessee SNF Facilities is expected to aggregate approximately $44.4 million.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Financing Activities</h2>
<p>On September 19, 2024, we prepaid in full the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan (as defined under "- Liquidity and Capital Resources - Material Cash Requirements" below). See Note 7, Debt , for additional information.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2024, we exercised the call option on the $75.0 million secured borrowing. See Note 7, Debt , for additional information.</p>
<h2>At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock</h2>
<p>On August 29, 2024, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $750.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated our previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (together, with all previous at-the-market equity offering programs, the "Previous ATM Programs" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, the ATM Program also provides for the ability to enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under the ATM Program.</p>
<p>In the event we enter into an ATM forward contract to sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program, we would expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at our discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time we would expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we would expect to receive upon physical settlement would be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement.</p>

<p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into ATM forward contracts under the ATM Program with a financial institution acting as a forward purchaser to sell 9,058,140 and 15,794,229 shares of common stock, respectively, at a weighted average initial sales price of $19.99 and $19.87 per share, respectively, before commissions and offering expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we settled 10,893,229 shares outstanding under the ATM forward contracts at a weighted average sales price of $19.57 for net proceeds of $213.1 million. No forward equity sales were executed or settled under the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and there were no outstanding ATM forward contracts that had not settled as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we had $440.1 million available for future issuances under the New ATM Program.</p>
<h2>Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale, and Asset Sales</h2>
<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that one ALF met the held for sale criteria and classified this property as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that two facilities held for sale no longer met the criteria to be held for sale and were reclassified as held for investment as of September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.4 million and $36.9 million, respectively, related to properties held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated income statements.</p>
<h2>Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications</h2>
<p>We periodically reassess our investments and tenant relationships, and from time to time we have selectively disposed of certain facilities or investments, or terminated tenant relationships, and we expect to continue making such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions. We classify our real estate investments as held for sale when the applicable criteria have been met, which includes a formal plan to sell the properties that is expected to be completed within one year, among other criteria. Upon designation as held for sale, we cease depreciation and record the investment at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell, which could result in an impairment of the real estate investments held for sale, if necessary.</p>
<p>On August 30, 2024, we completed the sale of a portfolio of 11 SNFs located in Iowa and Georgia, leased to affiliates of Arboreta Healthcare, Inc., as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Total contractual rent includes initial contractual cash rent and tenant operating expense reimbursements, as adjusted for applicable rental escalators and rent increases due to capital expenditures funded by the Company. For tenants on a cash basis, this represents the lesser of the amount that would be recognized on a straight-line basis or cash that has been received. Total contractual rent increased by $1.5 million due to a $1.6 million increase in rental income from real estate investments made after March 31, 2024, a $0.9 million increase in rental rates for our existing tenants, and an increase of $0.1 million related to the transfer of one facility to a new operator, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in rental income related to certain tenants on a cash basis method of accounting and a decrease of $0.2 million in tenant reimbursements.</p>
<p>Interest and other income. The $6.7 million, or 50%, increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million of interest income on new loan investments made after March 31, 2024, and an increase of $0.1 million of interest income due to a higher number of days during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million of interest earned on money market funds and a decrease of $0.2 million related to a loan origination fee received during the three months ended June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization. The $0.1 million, or 1%, increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million due to acquisitions and capital improvements made after March 31, 2024, partially offset by a</p>
<p>decrease of $0.4 million due to classifying assets as held for sale and a decrease of $0.2 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated after March 31, 2024.</p>

<p>Unrealized loss on other real estate related investments, net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a $7.3 million unrealized loss on our secured and mezzanine loans receivable due to an increase in interest rates during the first half of 2024, partially offset by unrealized gains of $6.6 million primarily due to a decrease in interest rates during the third quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an unrealized loss of $8.1 million on our secured and mezzanine loans receivable due to rising interest rates and a $0.3 million loss due to a loan origination fee paid, partially offset by a reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss of $0.5 million related to the repayment of one mezzanine loan receivable.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors.</p>
<p>Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating and interest expenses directly associated with our properties, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· interest expense and scheduled debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness;</li>
<li>· general and administrative expenses;</li>
<li>· dividend plans;</li>
<li>· operating lease obligations; and</li>
<li>· capital expenditures for improvements to our properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions and other investments (including mortgage and mezzanine loan originations), capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to invest in and/or develop additional healthcare and seniors housing properties as suitable opportunities arise and so long as adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in and/or development of properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancing of existing mortgage loans.</p>
<p>We believe that our expected operating cash flow from rent collections and interest payments on our other real estate related investments, together with our cash balance, available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and availability under the ATM Program will be sufficient to meet ongoing debt service requirements, dividend plans, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. While we may from time to time sell properties as part of our hold / investment strategy on an investment-by-investment basis, we currently do not expect to sell any of our properties to meet liquidity needs. Our quarterly cash dividend and any failure of our operators to pay rent or of our borrowers to make interest or principal payments may impact our available capital resources.</p>
<p>We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in February 2026 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement allows us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable, to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, in one or more offerings on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering. On August 29, 2024, we entered into the New ATM Program. In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more ATM forward contracts with sales agents for the sale of shares of our common stock under</p>
<p>the ATM Program. See "At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock" for information regarding activity under the ATM Program.</p>
<p>Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all debt covenants on our outstanding indebtedness.</p>

<p>Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating cash inflows are derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, including as a result of new investments, and interest payments on our other real estate related investments. Operating cash outflows consist primarily of interest expense on our borrowings and general and administrative expenses. The net increase of $56.9 million in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in rental income received, an increase in interest income received on our other real estate related investments, and a decrease in cash paid for interest expense, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for general and administrative expense.</p>
<p>Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of $777.1 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate, $52.0 million in preferred equity investments and $4.2 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by $5.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of real estate and $0.1 million in principal payments received on other loans receivable.

The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and all of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Notes.</p>
<h2>Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2022, we, together with certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the obligations thereunder are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates our amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provided for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.</p>
<p>On September 19, 2024 (the "Prepayment Date"), we prepaid all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan. The Term Loan was prepaid at the principal amount of the Term Loan, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but not including, the Prepayment Date. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.3 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of the Term Loan.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at our sole discretion, two six-month extension options. Prior to prepayment, the Term Loan had a maturity date of February 8, 2026.</p>
<p>The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan were, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (unless we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based off the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt).</p>

<p>As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Second Amended Credit Agreement.</p>
<h2>Capital Expenditures and Earn-Out Payments for Real Estate</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we had committed to fund expansions, construction, capital improvements and ESG incentives, which provides eligible triple-net tenants with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to our properties, at certain triple-net leased facilities totaling $14.8 million, of which $7.2 million is subject to rent increase at the time of funding. We expect to fund the capital expenditures in the next one to two years. As of September 30, 2024, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement which provided for an earn-out obligation of up to $10.0 million for one SNF in Virginia which was acquired during 2024. The earn-out is available, contingent on the operator achieving certain thresholds per the agreement, beginning in October 2025 through October 2026. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further i nformation regarding our obligation to finance certain capital expenditures under our triple-net leases.</p>
<h2>Dividend Plans</h2>
<p>We are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the annual dividend amount no less than 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. See Note 8, Equity, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of the cash dividends per share of our common stock declared by our board of directors for the three months ended Sep tember 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operati ons" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.</h2>
<p>Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness.</p>
<p>Our Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified inves tment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). As of Se ptember 30, 2024, we had no bor rowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan was prepaid.</p>
<p>An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisitio n by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Increased</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>inflation may also have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.</p>
<p>We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT - Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities," which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had no swap agreements to hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<h2>Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<h2>PART II-OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, but none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is, and none of their respective properties are, the subject of any material legal proceedings. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against its tenants, which are the responsibility of its tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors.</h2>
<p>We have disclosed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed.</p>
