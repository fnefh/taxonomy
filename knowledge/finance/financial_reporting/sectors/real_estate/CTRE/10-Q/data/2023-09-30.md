1. ORGANIZATION

---

Description of BusinessCareTrust REIT, Inc.'s ("CareTrust REIT" or the "Company") primary business consists of acquiring, financing, developing and owning real property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned directly or through a joint venture and leased to independent operators, 225 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 23,916 operational beds and units located in 28 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California, Texas, Louisiana, Idaho and Arizona. As of September 30, 2023, the Company also had other real estate related investments consisting of seven real estate secured loans receivable andone mezzanine loan receivable with a carrying value of $181.2 million.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

---

Basis of Presentation -The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for a complete set of annual audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CareTrust REIT, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Variable Interest Entities -The Company is required to continually evaluate its VIE relationships and consolidate these entities when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either: (i) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) substantially all of an entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights, or (iii) the equity investors as a group lack any of the following: (a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity. Criterion (iii) above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause. If neither of those criteria are met, the entity is a VIE.

The designation of an entity as a VIE is reassessed upon certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kick-out rights, (ii) a change to the capitalization structure of the entity, or (iii) acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control.

A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The Company's consideration of various factors include, but is not limited to, which activities most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the ability to direct those activities, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the VIE's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, its ability to manage its ownership interest relative to the other interest holders, and its ability to replace the VIE manager and/or liquidate the entity.

For any investment in a joint venture that is not considered to be VIE, the Company would evaluate the type of ownership rights held by limited partner(s) that may preclude consolidation by the majority interest holder. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their impact on the control of a joint venture should be made at inception of the joint venture and continually reassessed. See Note 11, Variable Interest Entities , for additional information.

---

Impairment of Real Estate Investments Held for Sale
---------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.9 million on four facilities held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $21.4 million on 12 facilities held for sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.2 million on one facility held for sale. These charges are reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge onsixteen and 27 facilities of $12.3 million and $72.0 million, respectively, all of which were held for sale.

As of September 30, 2023, there were15 facilities classified as held for sale, all of which have been marked down to fair value less estimated costs to sell.

The fair values of the assets held for sale were based on estimated sales prices, which are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Estimated sales prices were determined using a market approach (comparable sales model), which relies on certain assumptions by management, including: (i) comparable market transactions, (ii) estimated prices per unit, and (iii) binding agreements for sales and non-binding offers to purchase from unrelated third-parties. There are inherent uncertainties in making these assumptions. For the Company's impairment calculations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $18,000 to $35,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $23,000. For the Company's impairment calculations during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $35,000 to $145,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $80,000.

Impairment of Real Estate Investments Held for Investment
---------------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8.0 million related to one SNF. The Company wrote down its carrying value of $8.7 million to its estimated fair value of $0.7 million, which is included in real estate investments, net on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the asset was based on comparable market transactions and considered Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. For the Company's impairment calculation, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit of $7,000.

During the second quarter of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1.7 million related to one SNF. The Company wrote down its carrying value of $2.8 million to its estimated fair value of $1.1 million, which is included in real estate investments, net on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the asset was based on comparable market transactions and considered Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. For the Company's impairment calculation, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit of $20,000.

1. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

---

The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. GAAP guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.

The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and, depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. The Company does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

| Repayments | - | (15,000) |
| Balance as of September 30, 2023 | 159,371 | 21,804 |

Real estate secured and mezzanine loans receivable: The fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivables were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value, market interest rates and other credit enhancements. As such, the Company classifies each instrument as Level 3 due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining market interest rates for investments with similar terms. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $5.3 million related to four mortgage loans and one mezzanine loan receivable due to rising interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $8.1 million related to five mortgage loans and one mezzanine loan receivable due to rising interest rates and a $0.3 million loss due to a loan origination fee paid, partially offset by a reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss of $0.5 million related to the repayment of one mezzanine loan receivable. Future changes in market interest rates or collateral value could materially impact the estimated discounted cash flows that are used to determine the fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivable. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any loans that were 90 days or more past due.

The following table shows the quantitative information about unobservable inputs related to the Level 3 fair value measurements comprising the investments in secured and mezzanine loans receivables as of September 30, 2023:

| Type | Book Value as of September 30, 2023 | Valuation Technique | Unobservable Inputs | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mortgage secured loans receivable | $ 159,371 | Discounted cash flow | Discount Rate | 10% - 15% |
| Mezzanine loan receivable | 21,804 | Discounted cash flow | Discount Rate | 12% - 15% |

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no classification changes in assets and liabilities with Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

2028 Senior Notes. On June 17, 2021, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CTR Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the "Issuers"), completed a private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "Notes") to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued at par, resulting in gross proceeds of $400.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $393.8 million after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses. The Notes mature on June 30, 2028. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of3.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing on December 30, 2021.

The Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to March 30, 2028 at a price equal to100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a "make-whole" premium. At any time on or after March 30, 2028, the Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued interest on the Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, at any time on or prior to June 30, 2024, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 103.875% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. If certain changes of control of the Company occur, the Issuers will be required to make an offer to holders of the Notes to repurchase their Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date.

The obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by the Company and all of CareTrust's existing and future subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined below); provided, however, that such guarantees are subject to automatic release under certain customary circumstances.

The indenture governing the Notes contains customary covenants such as limiting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; incur or guarantee secured indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments or other restricted payments; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of their assets; and create restrictions on the ability of the Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or other amounts to the Issuers. The indenture governing the Notes also requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a specified ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions. The indenture governing the Notes also contains customary events of default.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes.

The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, the Operating Partnership, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries and KeyBank National Association entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based on the credit ratings of the Company's senior long-term unsecured debt). As of September 30, 2023, the Operating Partnership had $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at the sole discretion of the Operating Partnership,two six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The Second Amended Credit Facility is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (other than the Operating Partnership). The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend organizational documents and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. The Second Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum debt to asset value ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum cash distributions to operating income ratio, a maximum secured debt to asset value ratio, a maximum secured recourse debt to asset value ratio, a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered properties asset value ratio, a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and a minimum rent coverage ratio. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments under the Second Amended Credit Facility or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants (including the financial maintenance covenants), the occurrence of change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.

Common Stock
------------

At-The-Market Offering -On September 15, 2023, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $ 500.0 million in aggregate offering price of its common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated its previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "Previous ATM Program" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock, the Company may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of the Company's shares of common stock under the ATM Program.

The Company expects to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a oneyear term, at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time the Company expects to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that the Company expects to receive upon physical settlement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into ATM forward contracts under the ATM Program with a financial institution acting as a forward purchaser to sell 9,058,140 and 15,794,229 shares of common stock, respectively, at a weighted average initial sales price of $19.99 and $19.87 per share, respectively, before commissions and offering expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled 10,893,229 shares outstanding under the ATM forward contracts at a weighted average sales price of $19.57 for net proceeds of $213.1 million. For the remaining shares subject to the ATM forward contracts, the Company will not receive any proceeds from sales of those shares of common stock by the forward sellers until the forward contracts are settled.

There was no ATM Program activity (or activity under any predecessor at-the-market equity offering programs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.The following table summarizes the ATM Program activity under the ATM forward contracts and direct issuances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands, expect per share amounts).

1. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

---

All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units, relative total stockholder return based stock awards and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. Under the Plan, 5,000,000 shares have been authorized for awards.

Under the Plan, restricted stock awards ("RSAs") vest in equal annual installments over athree year period for the RSAs granted in 2022 and 2021 and afour year period for the RSAs granted in 2020. RSAs granted to nonemployee members of the board of directors ("Board Awards") vest in full on the earlier to occur of the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or one year. Performance stock awards ("PSAs") granted are subject to both time and performance based conditions and vest over a one-to-three year period for PSAs granted in 2021 and over aone-to-four year period for PSAs granted in 2020. The amount of such PSAs that will ultimately vest is dependent on the Company's Normalized Funds from Operations ("NFFO") per share, as defined by the Compensation Committee, meeting or exceeding a specified per share amount for the applicable vesting period. Relative total shareholder return units ("TSR Units") granted since 2021 are subject to both time and market based conditions and cliff vest after a three-year period. The amount of such market awards that will ultimately vest is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to a custom TSR peer group consisting of other publicly traded healthcare REITs and will range from 0% to 200% of the TSR Units initially granted. The RSAs, PSAs, and Board Awards are valued on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company's common stock, while the TSR Units are valued on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The vesting of certain awards may accelerate, as defined in the grant agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other events.

The following table summarizes the status of the restricted stock award and performance award activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

| | Shares | Weighted Average Share Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unvested balance at December 31, 2022 | 573,609 | 20.63 |
| Granted: | | |
| RSAs | 1,272 | 19.43 |
| Board Awards | 24,768 | 19.38 |
| Vested | (185,767) | 20.94 |
| Forfeited | (61,680) | 21.19 |
| Unvested balance at September 30, 2023 | 352,202 | 20.28 |

As of September 30, 2023, the weighted-average remaining vesting period of such awards was 1. 5 years.

1. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

---

Noncontrolling Interests -The Company has entered into ventures with unrelated third parties to own real estate and has concluded that such ventures are VIEs. As the Company exercises power over and receives economic benefits from the VIEs, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIEs. The Company presents the portion of any equity that the Company does not own in entities that the Company controls (and thus consolidates) as noncontrolling interests and classifies those interests as a component of consolidated equity, separate from stockholders' equity, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. For consolidated joint ventures, the Company allocates net income or loss utilizing the hypothetical liquidation at book value method, in which the Company allocates income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of the joint venture partners at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period. The Company includes net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests in net income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture ("JV"), whereunder the Company contributed $25.5 million into the JV that purchasedone SNF located in California for $26.1 million. The JV partner contributed the remaining $0.6 million of equity. The Company contributed to the JV an amount equal to95% of the JV's total investment amount in the one newly-acquired SNF and holds 100% of the preferred equity ownership interests in the JV. In addition, the Company contributed an amount equal to 2.5% of the JV's total investment amount in the one SNF for a 50% common ownership interest in the JV.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into a JV, whereunder the Company contributed $2.4 million into the JV, which made a deposit on a potential real estate acquisition. Upon the closing date of the real estate acquisition, the Company will hold an amount equal to 95% of the JV's total investment amount and will hold100% of the preferred equity ownership interest and an amount equal to2.5% of the JV's total investment amount for a 50% common ownership interest in the JV.

Overview

As of September 30, 2023, we owned, directly or through a joint venture, and leased to independent operators, 225 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 23,916 operational beds and units located in 28 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental revenues located in California, Texas, Louisiana, Idaho and Arizona. As of September 30, 2023, we also had other real estate related investments consisting of seven real estate secured loans receivable and one mezzanine loan receivable with an aggregate carrying value of $181.2 million.

We generate revenues primarily by leasing healthcare-related properties to healthcare operators in triple-net lease arrangements, under which the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property (including property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair costs and capital expenditures, subject to certain exceptions in the case of properties leased to Ensign and Pennant). From time to time, we also extend secured mortgage loans to healthcare operators, secured by healthcare-related properties, and secured mezzanine loans to healthcare operators, secured by membership interests in healthcare-related properties. We also partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint

ventures. We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment for internal reporting and internal decision-making purposes. We expect to grow our portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional properties that will be leased to a diverse group of local, regional and national healthcare providers, which may include new or existing skilled nursing operators, as well as seniors housing operators, behavioral health facilities and related businesses. We also anticipate diversifying our portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties in different geographic markets, and in different asset classes. In addition, we actively monitor the clinical, regulatory and financial operating results of our tenants, and work to identify opportunities within their operations and markets that could improve their operating results at our facilities. We communicate such observations to our tenants; however, we have no contractual obligation to do so. Moreover, our tenants have sole discretion with respect to the day-to-day operation of the facilities they lease from us, and how and whether to implement any observation we may share with them. We also actively monitor the overall occupancy, skilled mix, and other operating metrics of our tenants on at least a monthly basis including, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, any stimulus funds received by each tenant. We have replaced tenants in the past, and may elect to replace tenants in the future, if they fail to meet the terms and conditions of their leases with us. In addition, we have, and may from time to time in the future, repurpose facilities for other uses, such as behavioral health. The replacement tenants may include tenants with whom we have had no prior landlord-tenant relationship as well as current tenants with whom we are comfortable expanding our relationships. We have also provided select tenants with strategic capital for facility upkeep and modernization, as well as short-term working capital loans when they are awaiting licensure and certification or conducting turnaround work in one or more of our properties, and we may continue to do so in the future. In addition, we periodically reassess the investments we have made and the tenant relationships we have entered into, and have selectively disposed of facilities or investments, or terminated such relationships, and we expect to continue making such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions.

Recent Developments
-------------------

Post COVID-19 Pandemic Conditions and Outlook
---------------------------------------------

Tenants of our properties operating pursuant to triple-net master leases have been adversely impacted, and we expect that they will continue to be adversely impacted, by adverse conditions that emerged during, and have continued following, the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tenants are experiencing increased operating costs as a result of actions they took to prevent or mitigate the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 at their facilities. Our tenants are also experiencing labor shortages resulting in limited admissions, higher operating costs and continued reduced occupancy levels. At a portfolio wide level, occupancy levels at our seniors housing facilities, comprising our ALFs and ILFs, are continuing to show signs of recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, although they have not yet fully normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Within our SNFs, occupancy levels have continued to improve since their trough in January 2021, but still remain below pre-COVID occupancy levels for most of our tenants.

Federal and state governmental relief programs enacted during the pandemic provided temporary assistance to many of our tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund that began funding in late 2021, a temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration cuts under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and a temporary 6.2% increase in Federal Medical Assistance Percentage ("FMAP") that was approved retroactive to January 1, 2020 and will be phased down by December 31, 2023 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The tapering and/or end of these relief programs has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the business and financial condition of our tenants, as they continue to experience lower occupancy levels and higher operating costs.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") enacted the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency ("PHE") that allowed HHS to provide temporary regulatory waivers, including waiver of the three-day hospital stay requirement for a patient's Medicare benefits to refresh. This waiver had the effect of increasing skilled mix in our SNFs periodically during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during surges in COVID-19 outbreaks. An increase in skilled mix can, but may not necessarily, offset some or all of the adverse financial impact to the operator of the SNF from occupancy declines. The PHE, including HHS's waiver of the three-day hospital stay requirement, expired on May 11, 2023. With the expiration of the PHE and the lifting of the three-day hospital stay requirement, our SNFs may experience decreases in occupancy levels or revenues, which may have a further adverse impact on the business and financial condition of the operators of our SNFs.

State specific approaches have been developed including various states having increased their Medicaid base rates or taken other measures to account for the increase in expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Texas approved a $900 million general Medicaid rate increase as part of the overall state budget effective September 1, 2023, which will allow for the increase in its Medicaid rate to offset the expiration of the FMAP. There is no assurance that these measures

-----------------

will continue, will be widely available to our tenants or will sufficiently offset the impact that the government relief programs previously provided.

In July 2023, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") approved its payment rate update to SNF reimbursements for fiscal 2024, which commenced October 1, 2023, and includes a net increase of 4.0%, or approximately $1.4 billion, in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. This increase is expected to partially offset some of our tenants' higher operating costs.

On September 1, 2023, CMS issued proposed rules regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The proposed rule consists of three core staffing proposals: (1) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a nurse aid per resident per day; (2) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and (3) enhanced facility assessment requirements. The proposed rule also includes a staggered implementation approach and possible hardship exemptions for select facilities. Comments on the proposed rule had to be submitted by November 6, 2023. It is uncertain when the proposed rules will be finalized and become effective, what the ultimate scope and timing of the staffing requirements will be thereunder, and whether any such requirements will be accompanied by additional funding to offset any increased costs associated with meeting these requirements for our operators. Depending on the ultimate level of staffing required, an unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants.

As a result of impacts experienced by our tenants since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of some of our tenants to continue to meet their financial obligations to us in full has been negatively impacted. See "Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Asset Sales" below. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we collected 97.5% and 96.9%, respectively, of contractual rents due from our operators excluding cash deposits. In October 2023, we collected 99.3% of contractual rents due from our operators excluding cash deposits. From time to time in the past, we have taken actions to reposition one or more properties with a replacement tenant or sell the property and, in certain cases, we may also determine to restructure tenants' long-term obligations. In the event our tenants are unable to satisfy their obligations to us and we are unable to effect these actions on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place, our rental income could be adversely impacted and we may incur additional expenses or obligations and be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions
----------------------------------

The substantial inflationary pressures that our economy continues to face has resulted in many headwinds for us and our tenants, most notably in the form of rising interest rates, volatility in the capital markets, a softening of consumer sentiment and signs of a potential broader economic slowdown. These current macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation (including rising wages and supply costs), rising interest rates and related changes to consumer spending, including, but not limited to, causing individuals to delay or defer moves to seniors housing, has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our tenants' ability to meet some of their financial obligations to us. Rising interest rates also increase our costs of capital to finance acquisitions and increase our borrowing costs, and future changes in market interest rates could materially impact the estimated discounted cash flows that are used to determine the fair value of our other real estate related investments. In addition, current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting market volatility may adversely impact our ability to sell properties on acceptable terms, if at all, which could result in additional impairment charges.

For more information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 and macroeconomic conditions on our business, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale, and Asset Sales
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.9 million on four facilities held for sale. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $21.4 million on 12 facilities held for sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.2 million on one facility held for sale. These charges are reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The impairment charges were recognized to write down the properties' aggregate carrying value to their aggregate fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.0 million related to one SNF. We wrote down its carrying value of $8.7 million to its estimated fair value of $0.7 million, which is included in real estate investments, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the asset was based on comparable market transactions.

Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications

On October 20, 2023, we closed on the sale of one ALF consisting of 135 beds located in Florida with a carrying value of $1.6 million, which approximated the net sales proceeds received. The facility was classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023.

New Lease Agreement
-------------------

On October 24, 2023, the Company entered into a new master lease (the "New Ridgeline Lease") with affiliates of Ridgeline Properties, LLC to lease two ALFs in New Jersey which were non-operational and under a shortterm lease. The New Ridgeline Lease has an initial term at the date of the lease of approximately 10 years from the facility opening date with two five-year renewal options and CPI-based rent escalators. Annual cash rent under the new lease is approximately $1.0 million beginning on the first day of the second lease year.

Other Real Estate Investment Transactions
-----------------------------------------

In March 2023, the Company received full repayment of the outstanding balance of a $15 million mezzanine loan receivable.

Recent Investments
------------------

From January 1, 2023 through November 9, 2023, we acquired ten SNFs, one multi-service campus, and four ALFs for approximately $233.7 million, which includes estimated capitalized acquisition costs. These acquisitions are expected to generate initial annual cash revenues of approximately $19.2 million and an initial blended yield of approximately 8.2% before the impact of any rent abatement.

From January 1, 2023 through November 9, 2023, we originated $45.3 million in mortgage loans. These investments are expected to generate annual interest income of approximately $4.2 million and an initial blended yield of approximately 9.2%.

At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock
--------------------------------------

On September 15, 2023, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $500.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated our previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "Previous ATM Program" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Program.

From January 1, 2023 through November 9, 2023, we entered into ATM forward contracts under the ATM Program with a financial institution acting as a forward purchaser to sell an aggregate of 15,794,229 shares of common stock at a weighted average initial sales price of $19.87 per share before commissions and offering expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we settled 10,893,229 shares outstanding under the ATM forward contracts at a weighted average sales price of $19.57 for net proceeds of $213.1 million. For the remaining shares subject to the ATM forward contracts, we will not receive any proceeds from sales of those shares of common stock by the forward sellers until the forward contracts are settled. We currently expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at our discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement will be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement.

There was no ATM Program activity (or activity under any predecessor at-the-market equity offering programs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The following table summarizes the ATM Program activity under the ATM forward contracts and direct issuances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts).

| Average sales price per share | 19.89 | 19.89 |
| Gross proceeds (1) | 323,886 | 323,886 |

(1) Total gross proceeds is before $4.0 million of commissions paid to the sales agents and forward adjustments during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, under the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2023, 4,901,000 shares of common stock at the weighted average initial sales price of $20.00 per share as of September 30, 2023, before commissions and offering expenses, remain outstanding under the ATM forward contracts.

As of November 9, 2023, w e had $496.0 million avai lable for future issuances under the New ATM Program.

Unrealized losses on other real estate related investments, net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an unrealized loss of $8.1 million related to five mortgage loans and one mezzanine loan receivable due to rising interest rates and a $0.3 million loss due to a loan origination fee paid, partially offset by a reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss of $0.5 million related to the repayment of one mezzanine loan receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a $4.7 million unrealized loss on one secured loan receivable and two mezzanine loans receivable. The unrealized loss is due to rising interest rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors.

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating and interest expenses directly associated with our properties, including:

* · interest expense and scheduled debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness;
* · general and administrative expenses;
* · dividend plans;
* · operating lease obligations; and
* · capital expenditures for improvements to our properties.

Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions and other investments (including mortgage and mezzanine loan originations) capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to invest in and/or develop additional healthcare and seniors housing properties as suitable opportunities arise and so long as adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in and/or development of properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancing of existing mortgage loans.

We believe that our expected operating cash flow from rent collections, interest payments on our other real estate related investments, and borrowings under our Second Amended Credit Facility, together with our cash balance of $3.5 million, available borrowing capacity of $600.0 million under the Revolving Facility, 4,901,000 shares of common stock subject to forward equity sale contracts at the weighted average initial sales price of $20.00 per share, before commissions and offering expenses, which can be settled at any time before the one year anniversary of the applicable forward contract, and availability of $496.0 million under the ATM Program, each at September 30, 2023, will be sufficient to meet ongoing debt service requirements, dividend plans, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. While we are currently pursuing the sale, re-tenanting or repurposing of certain of our assets in connection with our ongoing review and monitoring of our investment portfolio as described under "Recent Developments" above, we currently do not expect to sell any of our properties to meet liquidity needs, although we may do so in the future. Our quarterly cash dividend and any failure of our operators to pay rent or of our borrowers to make interest or principal payments may impact our available capital resources.

We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in February 2026 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement allows us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable, to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, in one or more offerings on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering. On September 15, 2023, we entered into the New ATM Program. In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more ATM forward contracts with sales agents for the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Program. See "At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock" for information regarding activity under the ATM Program.

Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no

assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.

As of September 30, 2023, we are in compliance with all debt covenants on our outstanding indebtedness.

Cash Flows
----------

The following table presents selected data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2022 |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 112,096 | $ | 110,672 |
| Net cash used in investing activities | | (232,305) | | (141,759) |
| Net cash provided by financing activities | | 110,516 | | 16,053 |
| Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents | | (9,693) | | (15,034) |
| Cash and cash equivalents as of the beginning of period | | 13,178 | | 19,895 |
| Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of period | $ | 3,485 | $ | 4,861 |

Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Operating cash inflows are derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, including as a result of new investments, and interest payments on our other real estate related investments. Operating cash outflows consist primarily of interest expense on our borrowings and general and administrative expenses. The net increase of $1.4 million in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in interest income received on our other real estate related investments, an increase in rental income received, and a decrease in cash paid for general and administrative expense, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense.

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of $253.3 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate and $9.1 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by $15.7 million of principal payments received from our other real estate related investments and other loans receivable and $14.5 million in net proceeds from real estate sales. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily comprised of $171.6 million in acquisitions of real estate and investments in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and $5.5 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by $34.1 million in net proceeds from real estate sales and $1.2 million of principal payments received from other loans receivable.

Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily comprised of $319.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $1.1 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $125.0 million in net payments under our Revolving Facility (as defined below), $83.1 million in dividends paid and a $1.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock. Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily comprised of $100.0 million in net borrowings under our Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below), partially offset by $79.5 million in dividends paid and a $4.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock.

Material Cash Requirements
--------------------------

Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include:

3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028
--------------------------------------

On June 17, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, CTR Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the "Issuers"), completed a private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "Notes"). The Notes mature on June 30, 2028. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing on December 30, 2021. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and all of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below). As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Notes.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
-------------------------------------------------

On December 16, 2022, we, together with certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the obligations thereunder are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and certain of our subsidiaries. The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates our amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

As of September 30, 2023, we had$ 200.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan and n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at our sole discretion, t wo six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (unless we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based off the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt).

Table of Contents
-----------------

As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

Capital Expenditures
--------------------

As of September 30, 2023, we had committed to fund expansions, construction and capital improvements at certain triple-net leased facilities totaling $11.8 million, of which $3.2 million is subject to rent increase at the time of funding. We expect to fund the capital expenditures in the next one to two years. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further infor mation regarding our obligation to finance certain capital expenditures under our triple-net leases.

Dividend Plans
--------------

We are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the annual dividend amount no less than 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. See Note 8, Equity, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of the cash dividends per share of our common stock declared by our board of directors for the three months ended Sep tember 30, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
------------------------------------------

Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operati ons" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2023, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness.

Our Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million and an unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified inves tment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). As of September 30, 2023, we had a $ 200.0 million Term Loan outstanding and had n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Table of Contents
-----------------

An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisitio n by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Increased inflation may also have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.

Based on our outstanding debt balance as of September 30, 2023 described above and the interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt at September 30, 2023, assuming a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates related to our variable rate debt, interest expense would have increased approximately $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT - Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities," which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we had no swap agreements to hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
--------------------------------

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
----------------------------------

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of September 30, 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2023.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
--------------------------

The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, but none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is, and none of their respective properties are, the subject of any material legal proceedings. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against its tenants, which are the responsibility of its tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
----------------------

We have disclosed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Other than revisions to the risk factor below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such reports.

Investments through joint ventures involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have invested, and may continue to invest, as a joint venture partner in joint ventures. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present when acquiring real estate directly, including for example:

* · the joint venture partner(s) may at any time have economic or business interests or goals which are or which may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals, including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint venture or the timing of termination or liquidation of the joint venture;
* · the possibility that the joint venture partner(s) might become insolvent or bankrupt;
* · the possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by the joint venture partner(s);
* · joint ventures may share certain approval rights over major decisions;
* · a joint venture partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, including our policy with respect to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT;
* · our ability to sell or transfer our interest in the joint ventures on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of our agreements with the counterparties in the joint ventures;
* · we may be required to contribute additional capital if the counterparties in the joint ventures fail to fund their share of required capital contributions;
* · disputes between us and a joint venture partner may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable joint venture to additional risk; or
* · under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached which might have a negative influence on the joint venture.
