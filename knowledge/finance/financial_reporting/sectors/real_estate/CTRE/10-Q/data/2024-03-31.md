As of March 31, 2024, there were13 facilities classified as held for sale, all of which have been marked down to fair value less estimated costs to sell.

The fair values of the assets held for sale were based on estimated sales prices, which are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Estimated sales prices were determined using a market approach (comparable sales model), which relies on certain assumptions by management, including: (i) comparable market transactions, (ii) estimated prices per unit, and (iii) binding agreements for sales and non-binding offers to purchase from unrelated third-parties. There are inherent uncertainties in making these assumptions. For the Company's impairment calculations during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $12,000 to $36,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $16,000. One property, with no bed rights, was reclassified to held for sale during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company plans to dispose of this facility and does not expect to receive a material amount upon disposition. For the Company's impairment calculations during the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $20,000 to $85,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $32,000.

6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
--------------------------

The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. GAAP guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.

The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and, depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. The Company does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.

| Unrealized losses on other real estate related investments, net | (311) | (301) |
| Balance as of March 31, 2024 | 157,265 | 74,276 |

Real estate secured and mezzanine loans receivable: The fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivables were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value, market interest rates and other credit enhancements. As such, the Company classifies each instrument as Level 3 due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining market interest rates for investments with similar terms. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Comp any recorded an unrealized loss of $0.8 million on the Company's secured and mezzanine loans receivable due to rising interest rates, partially offset by unrealized gains of $0.2 million due to increases in expected cash flows on floating rate loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $ 1.0 million related to one mezzanine loan receivable due to rising interest rates, partially offset by a reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss of $0.5 million related to the repayment of one mezzanine loan receivable. Future changes in market interest rates or collateral value could materially impact the estimated discounted cash flows that are used to determine the fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any loans that were 90 days or more past due.

The following table shows the quantitative information about unobservable inputs related to the Level 3 fair value measurements comprising the investments in secured and mezzanine loans receivables as of March 31, 2024:

| Type | Book Value as of March 31, 2024 | Valuation Technique | Unobservable Inputs | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mortgage secured loans receivable | 157,265 | Discounted cash flow | Discount Rate | 9% - 15% |
| Mezzanine loan receivable | 74,276 | Discounted cash flow | Discount Rate | 12% - 15% |

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no classification changes in assets and liabilities with Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities: The carrying values for these instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Preferred equity investment: The fair value of the preferred equity investment was estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value, market interest rates and other credit enhancements. The Company utilized a discount rate of 15% in its fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.

Senior unsecured notes payable: The fair value of the Notes was determined using third-party quotes derived from orderly trades.

Unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured term loan: The fair values approximate their carrying values as the interest rates are variable and approximate prevailing market interest rates and spreads for similar debt arrangements.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
-------------------------------------------------

On December 16, 2022, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, the Company, as guarantor, CareTrust GP, LLC, and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, the Operating Partnership, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries and KeyBank National Association entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus

a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based on the credit ratings of the Company's senior long-term unsecured debt). As of March 31, 2024, the Operating Partnership had $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at the sole discretion of the Operating Partnership,two six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The Second Amended Credit Facility is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (other than the Operating Partnership). The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend organizational documents and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. The Second Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum debt to asset value ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum cash distributions to operating income ratio, a maximum secured debt to asset value ratio, a maximum secured recourse debt to asset value ratio, a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered properties asset value ratio, a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and a minimum rent coverage ratio. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments under the Second Amended Credit Facility or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants (including the financial maintenance covenants), the occurrence of change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

In the event the Company enters into an ATM forward contract to sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program, the Company would expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time the Company would expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that the Company would expect to receive upon physical settlement would be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement. There were no outstanding ATM forward contracts that had not settled as of March 31, 2024.

9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
---------------------------

All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units, relative total stockholder return based stock awards and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. Under the Plan, 5,000,000 shares have been authorized for awards.

Under the Plan, restricted stock awards ("RSAs") vest in equal annual installments over athree year period for the RSAs granted after 2020 and afour year period for the RSAs granted in 2020. RSAs granted to nonemployee members of the board of directors ("Board Awards") vest in full on the earlier to occur of the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or one year. Performance stock awards ("PSAs") granted were subject to both time and performance based conditions and vested over a one-to-three year period for PSAs granted in 2021 and over aone-to-four year period for PSAs granted in 2020. The amount of such PSAs that ultimately vested was dependent on the Company's Normalized Funds from Operations ("NFFO") per share, as defined by the Compensation Committee, meeting or exceeding a specified per share amount for the applicable vesting period. Relative total shareholder return units ("TSR Units") granted are subject to both time and market based conditions and cliff vest after a three-year period. The amount of such market awards that will ultimately vest is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to a custom TSR peer group consisting of other publicly traded healthcare REITs and will range from 0% to 200% of the TSR Units initially granted. The RSAs and Board Awards are valued on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company's common stock, while the TSR Units are valued on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The vesting of certain awards may accelerate, as defined in the grant agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other events.

The following table summarizes the status of the restricted stock award and performance award activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:

Table of Contents

|  | Shares | Weighted Average Share Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unvested balance at December 31, 2023 | 510,596 | 21.01 |
| Vested | (145,043) | 20.89 |
| Forfeited | (35,161) | 20.48 |
| Unvested balance at March 31, 2024 | 330,392 | 21.12 |

As of March 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining vesting period of such awards was 1. 9 years.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
---------------------------------

The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, which are not individually or in the aggregate anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against the Company's tenants, which are the responsibility of the Company's tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various commitments, typically consisting of funding of capital expenditures and short-term working capital loans to existing tenants while they await licensure and certification or are conducting turnaround work in one or more of the Company's properties.

Capital expenditures for each property leased under the Company's triple-net leases are generally the responsibility of the tenant, except for the facilities leased under certain master lease agreements, with subsidiaries of Ensign and Pennant, under which the tenant will have an option to require the Company to finance certain capital expenditures up to an aggregate of 20% of the Company's initial investment in such property, subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding. For the Company's other triple-net master leases, the tenants also have the option to request capital expenditure funding that would generally be subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding, which are subject to tenant compliance with the conditions to the Company's approval and funding of their requests. The C ompany has also provided select tenants with strategic capital for facility upkeep and modernization. The Company's Tenant Code of Conduct and Corporate Responsibility policy (the "Tenant ESG Program") provides eligible triple-net tenants of the Company with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to the Company's properties. Incentive options include a wide variety of opportunities for tenants to upgrade everything from energy and environmental systems to water-saving landscaping and more. The Company's board of directors has authorized annual allocations of up to $500,000 to fund the Tenant ESG Program.

The table below summarizes the Company's existing, known commitments and contingencies as of March 31, 2024 (in thousands):

Recent Acquisitions and Investment
----------------------------------

On April 1, 2024, the Company contributed $28.0 million to a JV that purchasedtwo multi-service campuses located in California for $28.8 million. In exchange, the Company holds 100% of the preferred equity interests in the JV and 50% of the common equity interest in the JV. The JV partner contributed the remaining $0.8 million of the total investment in exchange for50% of the common equity interest in the JV. In connection with the acquisition of the facilities, the Company entered into a new master lease with affiliates of Bayshire, LLC ("Bayshire"). The new lease has an initial term of approximately 15 years, with two five-year renewal options. Initial annual cash rent under the lease is approximately $2.7 million, increasing to approximately $2.9 million in the second year and $3.1 million in the third year, with 2% fixed annual escalators thereafter. The master lease provides for deferred rent in the first year of approximately $0.8 million.

On April 1, 2024, the Company acquired one multi-service campus located in California for approximately $32.3 million, which includes estimated capitalized acquisition costs. In connection with the acquisition of the facility, the Company amended an existing master lease with affiliates of Bayshire. The Bayshire lease, as amended, has a remaining initial term of approximately 10 years, with two five-year renewal options. Annual cash rent under the amended lease increased by approximately $2.6 million, increasing to approximately $3.0 million in the second year with CPI-based annual escalators thereafter.

On May 1, 2024, the Company extended a $26.7 million mortgage loan to a skilled nursing real estate owner. The mortgage loan is secured bytwo SNFs and bears interest at a rate of9.1%, payable monthly. The mortgage loan is set to mature on May 1, 2031 and includes a one year extension option. The mortgage loan may (subject to certain limited exceptions) not be prepaid prior to July 31, 2029. The mortgage loan includes a purchase option with an exercise window that opens during the initial 90-day period of each of the 4th, 5th and 6th loan years, with the purchase option price for the facilities being calculated by dividing the amount of the then annual base rent by an agreed upon lease yield.

Overview
--------

CareTrust REIT is a self-administered, publicly-traded REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, financing, development and leasing of skilled nursing, seniors housing and other healthcare-related properties. As of March 31, 2024, we owned, directly or indirectly through joint ventures, and leased to independent operators, 228 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 24,189 operational beds and units located in 29 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California and Texas. As of March 31, 2024, we also had other real estate related investments consisting of one preferred equity investment, nine real estate secured loans receivable and four mezzanine loans receivable with a carrying value of $233.3 million.

Recent Developments
-------------------

Market Trends and Uncertainties
-------------------------------

Current macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation (including higher wages and supply costs), elevated interest rates and related changes to consumer spending, including, but not limited to, causing individuals to delay or defer

Table of Contents
-----------------

moves to seniors housing, has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our tenants' ability to meet some of their financial obligations to us. Higher interest rates also increase our costs of capital to finance acquisitions and increase our borrowing costs. In addition, current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting market volatility may adversely impact our ability to sell properties on acceptable terms, if at all, which could result in additional impairment charges.

As a result of the above factors our tenants are continuing to experience increased operating costs at their facilities. Our tenants are also experiencing labor shortages resulting in higher operating costs. At a portfolio wide level, occupancy levels at our seniors housing facilities, comprising our ALFs and ILFs, continue to remain below occupancy levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within our SNFs, occupancy levels have continued to improve since their trough in January 2021 and remained stable for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, for most of our tenants.

As a result of impacts experienced by our tenants since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of some of our tenants to meet their financial obligations to us in full has been negatively impacted. From time to time in the past, we have taken actions to reposition one or more properties with a replacement tenant or sell the property and, in certain cases, we have also restructured tenants' long-term obligations. See "Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Asset Sales" below. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we collected 98.0% of contractual rents and interest due from our operators and borrowers excluding cash deposits. In the event our tenants are unable to satisfy their obligations to us and we are unable to effect these actions on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place, our rental income would be adversely impacted and we may incur additional expenses or obligations and be required to recognize additional impairment charges.

Regulatory Updates
------------------

In March 2024, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") proposed a payment rate update to SNF reimbursements for fiscal 2025, which includes a net increase of 4.1%, or approximately $1.4 billion in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. In July 2023, CMS approved its payment rate update to SNF reimbursements for fiscal 2024, which commenced October 1, 2023, and includes a net increase of 4.0%, or approximately $1.4 billion, in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. These increases are expected to partially offset some of our tenants' higher operating costs.

On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse's aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants.

On October 13, 2023, California Senate Bill No. 525 ("SB 525") was signed into law, requiring a substantial increase in the minimum wage for workers operating in certain health care facilities. As a result of SB 525, certain health care facilities (including licensed skilled nursing facilities) operating in California are required to increase the wages of their covered health care employees to at least $21 per hour from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026, $22 or $23 per hour (depending on facility type) from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028, and $25 per hour after June 1, 2028.

At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock
--------------------------------------

On September 15, 2023, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $500.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated our previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "Previous ATM Program" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, the ATM Program also provides for the ability to enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under the ATM Program.

The following tables summarize the ATM Program activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (in thousands, except per share amounts).

As of March 31, 2024, we had $0.9 million available for future issuances under the New ATM Program.

Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale, and Asset Sales
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million related to properties held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated income statements.

Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications
-----------------------------------------------

We periodically reassess our investments and tenant relationships, and from time to time we have selectively disposed of certain facilities or investments, or terminated tenant relationships, and we expect to continue making such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions. We classify our real estate investments as held for sale when the applicable criteria have been met, which includes a formal plan to sell the properties that is expected to be completed within one year, among other criteria. Upon designation as held for sale, we cease depreciation and record the investment at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell, which could result in an impairment of the real estate investments held for sale, if necessary.

Rental income . Rental income increased by approximately $29,000 as detailed below:

|  | Three Months Ended | Three Months Ended |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Contractual cash rent | 51,430 | 51,515 | (85) |

| Amortization of below market lease intangible | 575 | 384 | 191 |
| Total amount in rental income | 53,502 | 53,473 | 29 |

Total contractual rent includes initial contractual cash rent and tenant operating expense reimbursements, as adjusted for applicable rental escalators and rent increases due to capital expenditures funded by the Company. For tenants on a cash basis, this represents the lesser of the amount that would be recognized on a straight-line basis or cash that has been received. Total contractual cash rent decreased by $0.2 million due to a $1.1 million decrease in rental income related to certain tenants on a cash basis method of accounting and a $0.1 million decrease in tenant reimbursements, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in rental income from real estate investments made after October 1, 2023 and a $0.3 million increase in rental rates for our existing tenants.

Interest and other income. The $3.3 million, or 53%, increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million of interest income on money market funds and an increase of $1.4 million of interest income on new loan investments made after October 1, 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million related to repayments of loans receivable and a decrease of $0.2 million related to a prepayment penalty received during the three months ended December 31, 2023.

Depreciation and amortization. The $0.2 million, or 2%, increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million due to acquisitions and capital improvements made after October 1, 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated after October 1, 2023.

Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by approximately $38,000 as detailed below:

Unrealized (loss) gain on other real estate related investments, net. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded an $0.8 million unrealized loss on our secured and mezzanine loans receivable due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by unrealized gains of $0.2 million due to an increase in expected cash flows on floating rate loans. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $1.4 million unrealized gain due to a reversal of a previously recognized unrealized loss related to the partial repayment of one mortgage loan receivable, a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in projected forward interest rates.

Total contractual rent includes initial contractual cash rent and tenant operating expense reimbursements, as adjusted for applicable rental escalators and rent increases due to capital expenditures funded by the Company. For tenants on a cash basis, this represents the lesser of the amount that would be recognized on a straight-line basis or cash that has been received. Total contractual cash rent increased by $6.8 million due to a $4.2 million increase in rental income from real estate investments made after January 1, 2023, a $1.3 million increase in rental rates for our existing tenants, a $0.8 million increase in tenant reimbursements, a $0.5 million increase in rental income related to certain tenants on a cash basis method of accounting, and a $0.2 million increase in rental rates due to the transfer of two facilities to a new operator, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in rental income related to dispositions made after January 1, 2023.

Interest and other income. The $5.1 million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase of $3.5 million of interest income on money market funds, an increase of $2.6 million due to the origination of loans receivable after January 1, 2023, and an increase of $0.2 million due to originations of other loans, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million of interest income due to loan repayments and a decrease of $0.5 million related to a prepayment penalty on one mezzanine loan receivable during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Depreciation and amortization. The $1.2 million, or 10%, increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million related to acquisitions and capital improvements made after January 1, 2023, partially offset

by a decrease of $0.5 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated after January 1, 2023 and a decrease of $0.3 million due to classifying assets as held for sale after January 1, 2023.

Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $1.6 million as detailed below:

Impairment of real estate investments. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of $2.7 million related to properties held for sale.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors.

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating and interest expenses directly associated with our properties, including:

* · interest expense and scheduled debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness;
* · general and administrative expenses;
* · dividend plans;
* · operating lease obligations; and
* · capital expenditures for improvements to our properties.

Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions and other investments (including mortgage and mezzanine loan originations), capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to invest in and/or develop additional healthcare and seniors housing properties as suitable opportunities arise and so long as adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in and/or development of properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancing of existing mortgage loans.

We believe that our expected operating cash flow from rent collections and interest payments on our other real estate related investments, together with our cash balance of $451.2 million and available borrowing capacity of $600.0 million under the Revolving Facility (as defined below), each at March 31, 2024, will be sufficient to meet ongoing debt service requirements, dividend plans, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. We currently do not expect to sell any of our properties to meet liquidity needs, although we may do so from time to time as part of our hold strategy on an investment-by-investment basis. Our quarterly cash dividend and any failure of our operators to pay rent or of our borrowers to make interest or principal payments may impact our available capital resources.

We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in February 2026 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement allows us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable, to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, in one or more offerings on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering. On September 15, 2023, we entered into the New ATM Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold $273.2 million of shares of our common stock under the New ATM Program. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $0.9 million available for future issuances under the New ATM Program. See "At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock" for information regarding activity under the ATM Program.

Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.

As of March 31, 2024, we are in compliance with all debt covenants on our outstanding indebtedness.

Cash Flows
----------

The following table presents selected data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 | 2023 |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 48,820 | $ | 35,120 |
| Net cash used in investing activities |  | (123,241) |  | (818) |
| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities |  | 231,146 |  | (19,410) |

| Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of period | $ | 451,173 | $ | 28,070 |

Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Operating cash inflows are derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, including as a result of new investments, and interest payments on our other real estate related investments. Operating cash outflows consist primarily of interest expense on our borrowings and general and administrative expenses. The net increase of $13.7 million in cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in rental income received, an increase in interest income received on our other real estate related investments, and a decrease in cash paid for interest expense, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for general and administrative expense.

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily comprised of $122.9 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate and $0.4 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily comprised of $17.2 million in escrow deposits for acquisitions of real estate and $2.0 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by $15.1 million of principal payments received from our other real estate related investments and other loans receivable and $3.2 million in net proceeds from real estate sales.

Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were primarily comprised of $269.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $0.4 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $36.5 million in dividends paid and a $2.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock. Our cash flows used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were primarily comprised of $27.4 million in dividends paid, a $1.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock and $0.5 million in costs paid for the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $10.0 million in borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below).

Material Cash Requirements
--------------------------

Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include:

3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028
--------------------------------------

On June 17, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, CTR Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the "Issuers"), completed a private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "Notes").

The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and all of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below). As of March 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Notes.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
-------------------------------------------------

On December 16, 2022, we, together with certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the obligations thereunder are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates our amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

As of March 31, 2024, we had$ 200.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan and n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at our sole discretion, t wo six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (unless we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based off the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt).

As of March 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

Capital Expenditures
--------------------

As of March 31, 2024, we had committed to fund expansions, construction, capital improvements and ESG incentives, which provides eligible triple-net tenants with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to our properties, at certain triple-net leased facilities totaling $13.1 million, of which $4.9 million is subject to rent increase at the time of funding. We expect to fund the capital expenditures in the next one to two years. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further infor mation regarding our obligation to finance certain capital expenditures under our triple-net leases.

Dividend Plans
--------------

We are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the annual dividend amount no less than 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. See Note 8, Equity, to our condensed consolidated

financial statements included in this report for a summary of the cash dividends per share of our common stock declared by our board of directors for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
------------------------------------------

Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operati ons" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness.

Our Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million and an unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified inves tment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). As of March 31, 2024, we had a $ 200.0 million Term Loan outstanding and had n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisitio n by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Increased inflation may also have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.

Based on our outstanding debt balance as of March 31, 2024 described above and the interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt at March 31, 2024, assuming a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates related to our variable rate debt, interest expense would have increased approximately $0.5 million for the t hree months ended March 31, 2024.

We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT - Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities," which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, we had no swap agreements to

hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
--------------------------------

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
----------------------------------

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of March 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of March 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
--------------------------

The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, but none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is, and none of their respective properties are, the subject of any material legal proceedings. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against its tenants, which are the responsibility of its tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
----------------------

We have disclosed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed other than as set forth below.

Healthcare reform legislation impacts cannot accurately be predicted and could adversely affect our results of operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We and the healthcare operators leasing our properties depend on the healthcare industry and are susceptible to risks associated with healthcare reform. Legislative proposals are introduced each year that would introduce major changes in the healthcare system, both nationally and at the state level. For example, we believe that efforts may be made to, among other things, transition Federal payment programs further in the direction of value based care, but we cannot predict whether or in what form any of these measures may be enacted, or what effect they would have on our business or the businesses of our tenants if enacted. Efforts may also be made to reduce the age at which individuals become eligible for Medicare, which could have an adverse impact on our tenants because Medicare sometimes reimburses long term care providers at rates lower than those paid by commercial payors. In addition, the Biden Administration announced a focus on implementing minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections as part of nursing home reforms announced in the 2022 State of the Union Address. On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse's aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants. We cannot predict whether any future legislation related to staffing will be adopted or, if adopted, the impact such legislation may have on our tenants or our business.

Our tenants are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry that include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights and insurance, fraudulent or abusive behavior, labor and employment issues and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. See "Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement" in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, for more information. If our tenants or operators fail to comply with the laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant operational changes. The cost to comply with these laws, regulations and other requirements results in increased costs of doing business for our tenants and operators. For example, on October 13, 2023, California Senate Bill No. 525 ("SB 525") was signed into law, requiring a substantial increase in the minimum wage for workers operating in certain health care facilities. As a result of SB 525, certain health care facilities (including licensed skilled nursing facilities) operating in California are required to increase the wages of their covered health care employees to at least $21 per hour from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026, $22 or $23 per hour (depending on facility type) from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028, and $25 per hour after June 1, 2028. If our tenants are unable to offset these increased costs, the operating results and financial condition of our tenants will be adversely impacted and they may be unable to satisfy their rent obligations to us.

We believe that additional resources may be dedicated to regulatory enforcement, which could further increase our tenants' costs of doing business and negatively impact their ability to pay their rent obligations to us. Changes in enforcement

-----------------

policies by federal and state governments have also resulted in a significant increase in inspection rates, citations of regulatory deficiencies and sanctions, including terminations from Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and criminal penalties. Our tenants and operators could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation, lawsuit or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, if our tenants' residents do not have insurance, it could adversely impact the tenants' ability to satisfy their obligation to us.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we acquired shares of our common stock held by employees who tendered shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of previously issued restricted stock awards. Specifically, the number of shares of common stock acquired from employees and the average prices paid per share for each month in the three months ended March 31, 2024 are shown in the table below.
