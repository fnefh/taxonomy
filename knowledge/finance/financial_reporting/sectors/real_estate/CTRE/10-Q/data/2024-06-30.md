1. ORGANIZATION

______________________________________________________________________

Description of BusinessCareTrust REIT, Inc.'s ("CareTrust REIT" or the "Company") primary business consists of acquiring, financing, developing and owning real property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. As of June 30, 2024, the Company owned, directly or through joint ventures, and leased to independent operators 235 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 25,058 operational beds and units located in 30 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California and Texas. As of June 30, 2024, the Company also had other real estate related investments consisting of two preferred equity investments, 11 real estate secured loans receivable andfour mezzanine loans receivable with a carrying value of $433.5 million.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

______________________________________________________________________

Basis of Presentation -The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for a complete set of annual audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CareTrust REIT, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities ("VIEs") over which the Company exercises control. All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Transfers of financial assets -The Company accounts for transfers of financial assets as sales when it has surrendered control over the related assets. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other things, an evaluation of relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred. Transfers of financial assets that do not qualify for sale accounting are reported as collateralized borrowings. Accordingly, the related assets remain on the Company's balance sheet and continue to be reported and accounted for as if the transfer had not occurred. Cash proceeds from these transfers are reported as liabilities, with attributable interest expense recognized over the life of the related transactions.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized aggregate impairment charges of $21.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, related to properties held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

As of June 30, 2024, there were20 facilities classified as held for sale, all of which have been marked down to fair value less estimated costs to sell.

The fair values of the assets held for sale were based on estimated sales prices, which are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Estimated sales prices were determined using a market approach (comparable sales model), which relies on certain assumptions by management, including: (i) comparable market transactions, (ii) estimated prices per unit, and (iii) binding agreements for sales and non-binding offers to purchase from unrelated third-parties. There are inherent uncertainties in making these assumptions. For the Company's impairment calculations during the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $11,000 to $46,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $24,000. One property, with no bed rights, was reclassified to held for sale during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company disposed of this facility during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $21,000. For the Company's impairment calculations during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company's fair value estimates primarily relied on a market approach and utilized prices per unit ranging from $18,000 to $35,000, with a weighted average price per unit of $21,000.

6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

______________________________________________________________________

The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. GAAP guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.

## CARETRUST REIT, INC.

## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -

(Unaudited)

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.

The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and, depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. The Company does not expect that changes in classifications between levels will be frequent.

## Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall (dollars in thousands):

| Unrealized loss on other real estate related investments, net | (2,039) | (450) |
| Balance as of June 30, 2024 | 348,552 | 74,099 |

Real estate secured and mezzanine loans receivable: The fair values of the secured and mezzanine loans receivables were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value, market interest rates and other credit enhancements. As such, the Company classifies each instrument as Level 3 due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining market interest rates for investments with similar terms. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $2.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively, on the Company's secured and mezzanine loans receivable due to rising interest rates, partially offset by unrealized gains of $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, due to increases in expected cash flows on floating rate loans. Future changes in market interest rates or collateral value could materially impact the estimated discounted cash flows that are used to determine the fair value of the secured and mezzanine loans receivable. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any loans that were 90 days or more past due.

## Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan

On December 16, 2022, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, the Company, as guarantor, CareTrust GP, LLC, and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates the Company's amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, the Operating Partnership, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly owned subsidiaries and KeyBank National Association entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based on the credit ratings of the Company's senior long-term unsecured debt). As of June 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan and no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at the sole discretion of the Operating Partnership,two six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The Second Amended Credit Facility is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to the Second Amended Credit Agreement (other than the Operating Partnership). The Second Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend organizational documents and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. The Second Amended Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum debt to asset value ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum cash distributions to operating income ratio, a maximum secured debt to asset value ratio, a maximum secured recourse debt to asset value ratio, a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered properties asset value ratio, a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and a minimum rent coverage ratio. The Second Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments under the Second Amended Credit Facility or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants (including the financial maintenance covenants), the occurrence of change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

## Secured Borrowing

On June 3, 2024, KeyBank National Association purchased a $75.0 million undivided participation interest in a $165.0 million mortgage loan from the Company (see Note 5, Other Real Estate Related and Other Investments , for additional information), which bears interest at a rate of SOFR, with a term SOFR floor of3.00%, plus 2.5% or 2.25%, depending on the debt yield of the loan, and payable monthly. As the transaction did not qualify as a sale in accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded the participation interest as a secured borrowing in the amount of $75.0 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The participating interest may be pr epaid in whole before the maturity date for an exit fee of up to 0.50% of the loan plus unpaid interest. Th e participation interest provides for a put option, subject to certain restrictions, and a call option for the then-outstanding loan amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of June 30, 2024, the interest rate in effect for the secured borrowing was 7.83%. On July 30, 2024, the Company exercised the call option on the $75.0 million secured borrowing.

8. EQUITY

______________________________________________________________________

## Common Stock

At-The-Market Offering -On May 6, 2024, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $ 500.0 million in aggregate offering price of its common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated its previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "Previous ATM Program" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock, the ATM Program also provides for the ability to enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of the Company's shares of common stock under the ATM Program.

In the event the Company enters into an ATM forward contract to sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program, the Company would expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at the Company's discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time the Company would expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that the Company would expect to receive upon physical settlement would be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement.

The following table summarizes the ATM Program activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Table of Contents

| | For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 | For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 |

| Number of shares | 12,145 | 23,745 |
| Average sales price per share | 25.24 | 24.42 |
| Gross proceeds (1) | 306,534 | 579,767 |

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company executed forward equity sales under the ATM Program with a financial institution acting as a forward purchaser to sell6,736,089 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of $19.71 per share before commissions and offering expenses. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales of its shares of common stock by the forward sellers. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had not settled any portion of these forward equity sales. No forward equity sales were executed or settled under the ATM Program during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and there were no outstanding ATM forward contracts that had not settled as of June 30, 2024.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $193.5 million available for future issuances under the New ATM Program.

9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

______________________________________________________________________

All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units, relative total stockholder return based stock awards and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. Under the Plan, 5,000,000 shares have been authorized for awards.

Under the Plan, restricted stock awards ("RSAs") vest in equal annual installments over athree year period for the RSAs granted after 2020 and afour year period for the RSAs granted in 2020. RSAs granted to nonemployee members of the board of directors ("Board Awards") vest in full on the earlier to occur of the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or one year. Performance stock awards ("PSAs") granted were subject to both time and performance based conditions and vested over a one-to-three year period for PSAs granted in 2021 and over aone-to-four year period for PSAs granted in 2020. The amount of such PSAs that ultimately vested was dependent on the Company's Normalized Funds from Operations ("NFFO") per share, as defined by the Compensation Committee, meeting or exceeding a specified per share amount for the applicable vesting period. Relative total shareholder return units ("TSR Units") granted are subject to both time and market based conditions and cliff vest after a three-year period. The amount of such market awards that will ultimately vest is dependent on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to a custom TSR peer group consisting of other publicly traded healthcare REITs and will range from 0% to 200% of the TSR Units initially granted. The RSAs and Board Awards are valued on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company's common stock, while the TSR Units are valued on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The vesting of certain awards may accelerate, as defined in the grant agreement, upon retirement, a change in control or other events.

The following table summarizes the status of the restricted stock award and performance award activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:

| | Shares | Weighted Average Share Price | Weighted Average Share Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unvested balance at December 31, 2023 | 510,596 | $ | 21.01 |
| Granted: | | | |

| Unvested balance at June 30, 2024 | 327,336 | $ | 21.43 |

The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, which are not individually or in the aggregate anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against the Company's tenants, which are the responsibility of the Company's tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various commitments, typically consisting of funding of capital expenditures and short-term working capital loans to existing tenants while they await licensure and certification or are conducting turnaround work in one or more of the Company's properties.

Capital expenditures for each property leased under the Company's triple-net leases are generally the responsibility of the tenant, except for the facilities leased under certain master lease agreements, with subsidiaries of Ensign and Pennant, under which the tenant will have an option to require the Company to finance certain capital expenditures up to an aggregate of 20% of the Company's initial investment in such property, subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding. For the Company's other triple-net master leases, the tenants also have the option to request capital expenditure funding that would generally be subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding, which are subject to tenant compliance with the conditions to the Company's approval and funding of their requests. The C ompany has also provided select tenants with strategic capital for facility upkeep and modernization. The Company's Tenant Code of Conduct and Corporate Responsibility policy (the "Tenant ESG Program") provides eligible triple-net tenants of the Company with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to the Company's properties.

## Overview

CareTrust REIT is a self-administered, publicly-traded REIT engaged in the ownership, acquisition, financing, development and leasing of skilled nursing, seniors housing and other healthcare-related properties. As of June 30, 2024, we owned, directly or indirectly through joint ventures, and leased to independent operators 235 skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs"), multi-service campuses, assisted living facilities ("ALFs") and independent living facilities ("ILFs") consisting of 25,058 operational beds and units located in 30 states with the highest concentration of properties by rental income located in California and Texas. As of June 30, 2024, we also had other real estate related investments consisting of two preferred equity investments, 11 real estate secured loans receivable and four mezzanine loans receivable with a carrying value of $433.5 million.

## Recent Developments

## Market Trends and Uncertainties

Current macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation (including higher wages and supply costs), elevated interest rates and related changes to consumer spending, including, but not limited to, causing individuals to delay or defer

moves to seniors housing, has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our tenants' ability to meet some of their financial obligations to us. Higher interest rates also increase our costs of capital to finance acquisitions and increase our borrowing costs. In addition, current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting market volatility may adversely impact our ability to sell properties on acceptable terms, if at all, which could result in additional impairment charges.

As a result of the above factors, our tenants are continuing to experience increased operating costs at their facilities. Our tenants are also experiencing labor shortages resulting in higher operating costs. At a portfolio wide level, occupancy levels at our seniors housing facilities, comprising our ALFs and ILFs, continue to remain below occupancy levels at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within our SNFs, occupancy levels have continued to improve since their trough in January 2021 and remained stable for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, for most of our tenants.

As a result of impacts experienced by our operators since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of some of our tenants and borrowers to meet their financial obligations to us in full has been negatively impacted. From time to time in the past, we have taken actions to reposition one or more properties with a replacement tenant or sell the property and, in certain cases, we have also restructured tenants' long-term obligations. See "Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Asset Sales" below. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we collected 98.3% of contractual rents and interest due from our operators and borrowers excluding cash deposits. In the event our tenants or borrowers are unable to satisfy their obligations to us and we are unable to effect these actions on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place, our rental and interest income would be adversely impacted and we may incur additional expenses or obligations and be required to recognize additional impairment charges or fair value adjustments.

## Regulatory Updates

On October 13, 2023, California Senate Bill No. 525 ("SB 525") was signed into law, requiring a substantial increase in the minimum wage for workers operating in certain health care facilities. As a result of SB 525, certain health care facilities (including licensed skilled nursing facilities) operating in California are required to increase the wages of their covered health care employees to at least $21 per hour, which was initially required to be effective from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026, $22 or $23 per hour (depending on facility type) from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028, and $25 per hour after June 1, 2028. On June 22, 2024, the Governor of California announced that the implementation of SB 525 will be delayed until October 15, 2024 at the earliest and no later than January 1, 2025.

In March 2024, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") proposed a payment rate update to SNF reimbursements for fiscal 2025, which includes a net increase of 4.1%, or approximately $1.4 billion in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. In July 2023, CMS approved its payment rate update to SNF reimbursements for fiscal 2024, which commenced October 1, 2023, and includes a net increase of 4.0%, or approximately $1.4 billion, in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. These increases are expected to partially offset some of our tenants' higher operating costs.

On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding minimum staffing requirements and increased inspections at nursing homes in order to establish comprehensive nurse staffing requirements. The rule consists of three core staffing requirements: (1) overall minimum standard of 3.48 total nurse staff hours per resident day; (2) minimum nurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses and 2.45 hours of care from a certified nurse's aid per resident per day; and (3) a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rule includes a staggered implementation approach for which CMS will publish additional details on compliance as the implementation dates approach. The rule also includes possible waivers and temporary hardship exemptions for select facilities, however no funding for the additional staff will be provided. We are currently evaluating the impact of the rule, but believe the unfunded mandate to increase staff may have a material and adverse impact on the financial condition of our tenants.

## Payment on Secured Borrowing

On July 30, 2024, we exercised the call option on the $75.0 million secured borrowing. See Note 14, Subsequent Events , for additional information.

## At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock

On May 6, 2024, we entered into a new equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $500.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "New ATM Program") and terminated our previous $500.0 million "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "Previous ATM Program" and together with the New ATM Program, the "ATM Program"). In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, the ATM Program also provides for the ability to enter into one or more forward sales agreements (each, an "ATM forward contract") with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under the ATM Program.

In the event we enter into an ATM forward contract to sell shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program, we would expect to fully physically settle forward equity sales by delivery of shares of common stock to the forward purchaser and receive cash proceeds upon one or more settlement dates, which are typically a one-year term, at our discretion, prior to the final settlement date, at which time we would expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares sold on a forward basis multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. The weighted average forward sale price that we would expect to receive upon physical settlement would be subject to adjustment for (i) a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread, (ii) the forward purchaser's stock borrowing costs and (iii) scheduled dividends through the settlement.

The following tables summarize the ATM Program activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 (in thousands, except per share amounts).

| | For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 | For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 |

| Average sales price per share | 25.24 | 24.42 |
| Gross proceeds (1) | 306,534 | 579,767 |

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we executed forward equity sales under the ATM Program with a financial institution acting as a forward purchaser to sell 6,736,089 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of $19.71 per share before commissions and offering expenses. We did not receive any proceeds from the sales of our shares of common stock by the forward sellers. As of June 30, 2023, we had not settled any portion of these forward equity sales, which were subsequently settled during the second half of 2023. No forward equity sales were executed or settled under the ATM Program during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and there were no outstanding ATM forward contracts that had not settled as of June 30, 2024.

As of June 30, 2024, we had $193.5 million available for future issuances under the New ATM Program.

## Impairment of Real Estate Assets, Assets Held for Sale, and Asset Sales

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that a portfolio of eight ALFs met the held for sale criteria and classified these properties as held for sale at June 30, 2024. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $25.7 million and $28.5 million, respectively, related to properties held for sale, which is reported in impairment of real estate investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

## Asset Sales and Held for Sale Reclassifications

We periodically reassess our investments and tenant relationships, and from time to time we have selectively disposed of certain facilities or investments, or terminated tenant relationships, and we expect to continue making such reassessments and, where appropriate, taking such actions. We classify our real estate investments as held for sale when the applicable criteria have been met, which includes a formal plan to sell the properties that is expected to be completed within one year, among other criteria. Upon designation as held for sale, we cease depreciation and record the investment at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell, which could result in an impairment of the real estate investments held for sale, if necessary.

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly

## Table of Contents

dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors.

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating and interest expenses directly associated with our properties, including:

- · interest expense and scheduled debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness;
- · general and administrative expenses;
- · dividend plans;
- · operating lease obligations; and
- · capital expenditures for improvements to our properties.

Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions and other investments (including mortgage and mezzanine loan originations), capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to invest in and/or develop additional healthcare and seniors housing properties as suitable opportunities arise and so long as adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in and/or development of properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancing of existing mortgage loans.

We believe that our expected operating cash flow from rent collections and interest payments on our other real estate related investments, together with our cash balance, available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and availability under the ATM Program will be sufficient to meet ongoing debt service requirements, dividend plans, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other needs for at least the next 12 months. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. While we may from time to time sell properties as part of our hold / investment strategy on an investment-by-investment basis, we currently do not expect to sell any of our properties to meet liquidity needs. Our quarterly cash dividend and any failure of our operators to pay rent or of our borrowers to make interest or principal payments may impact our available capital resources.

We have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in February 2026 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement allows us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable, to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, in one or more offerings on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering. On May 6, 2024, we entered into the New ATM Program. In addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, we may also enter into one or more ATM forward contracts with sales agents for the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Program. See "At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock" for information regarding activity under the ATM Program.

Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.

As of June 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all debt covenants on our outstanding indebtedness.

## Cash Flows

The following table presents selected data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | For the Six Months Ended June 30, | For the Six Months Ended June 30, | For the Six Months Ended June 30, | For the Six Months Ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2024 | | |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 101,795 | $ | 66,986 |
| Net cash used in investing activities | | (468,637) | | (176,644) |
| Net cash provided by financing activities | | 567,528 | | 97,625 |
| Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | | 200,686 | | (12,033) |
| Cash and cash equivalents as of the beginning of period | | 294,448 | | 13,178 |
| Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of period | $ | 495,134 | $ | 1,145 |

Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Operating cash inflows are derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, including as a result of new investments, and interest payments on our other real estate related investments. Operating cash outflows consist primarily of interest expense on our borrowings and general and administrative expenses. The net increase of $34.8 million in cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in rental income received, an increase in interest income received on our other real estate related investments, and a decrease in cash paid for interest expense, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for general and administrative expense.

Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of $458.5 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate, $9.0 million in preferred equity investments and $1.3 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of $200.0 million in acquisitions of real estate, investment in real estate related investments and other loans receivable and escrow deposits for potential acquisitions of real estate and $6.4 million of purchases of equipment, furniture and fixtures and improvements to real estate, partially offset by $15.3 million of principal payments received from our other real estate related investments and other loans receivable and $14.5 million in net proceeds from real estate sales.

Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily comprised of $572.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $75.0 million in proceeds from a secured borrowing and $0.6 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $77.7 million in dividends paid and a $2.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock. Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily comprised of $155.0 million in borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below), partially offset by $55.2 million in dividends paid, a $1.5 million net settlement adjustment on restricted stock and $0.6 million in costs paid for the issuance of common stock.

## Material Cash Requirements

Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include:

## 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028

On June 17, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, CTR Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the "Issuers"), completed a private offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the "Notes"). The Notes mature on June 30, 2028. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing on December 30, 2021. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and all of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility (as defined below). As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Notes.

## Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan

On December 16, 2022, we, together with certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a second amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender (as amended from time to time, the "Second Amended Credit Agreement"). The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, and the obligations thereunder are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. The Second Amended Credit Agreement, which amends and restates our amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of February 8, 2019 (as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement") provides for: (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") with revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, including a letter of credit subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and a swingline loan subfacility for 10% of the then available revolving commitments and (ii) the continuation of the unsecured term loan credit facility which was previously extended under the Prior Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan" and together with the Revolving Facility, the "Second Amended Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million. Future borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Facility will be used for working capital purposes, for capital expenditures, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

On October 10, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association (the "First Amendment"). The First Amendment restates the definition of Consolidated Total Asset Value to include net proceeds from at-the-market forward commitments executed but not yet closed as of the relevant date as if such proceeds had actually been received.

As of June 30, 2024, we had$ 200.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan and n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 9, 2027, and includes, at our sole discretion, t wo six-month extension options. The Term Loan has a maturity date of February 8, 2026.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt). In addition, the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries (unless we obtain certain specified investment grade ratings on our senior long-term unsecured debt and the Operating Partnership elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Operating Partnership will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based off the credit ratings of our senior long-term unsecured debt).

As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about the Second Amended Credit Agreement.

## Secured Borrowing

On June 3, 2024, KeyBank National Association purchased a $75.0 million undivided participation interest in a $165.0 million mortgage loan from us (see Note 5, Other Real Estate Related and Other Investments , for additional information), which bears interest at a rate of SOFR, with a term SOFR floor of 3.0%, plus 2.5% or 2.25%, depending on the debt yield of the loan, and payable monthly. As the transaction did not qualify as a sale in accordance with GAAP, we recorded the participation interest as a secured borrowing in the amount of $75.0 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The participating interest may be prepaid in whole before the maturity date for an exit fee of up to 0.50% of the loan plus unpaid interest. The participation interest provides for a put option, subject to certain restrictions and a call option for the then-outstanding loan amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of June 30, 2024, the interest rate in effect for the secured borrowing was 7.83%. On July 30, 2024, we exercised the call option on the $75.0 million secured borrowing.

## Capital Expenditures

As of June 30, 2024, we had committed to fund expansions, construction, capital improvements and ESG incentives, which provides eligible triple-net tenants with monetary inducements to make sustainable improvements to our properties, at certain triple-net leased facilities totaling $14.3 million, of which $6.5 million is subject to rent increase at the

time of funding. We expect to fund the capital expenditures in the next one to two years. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further infor mation regarding our obligation to finance certain capital expenditures under our triple-net leases.

## Dividend Plans

We are required to pay dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and we expect to make quarterly dividend payments in cash with the annual dividend amount no less than 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. See Note 8, Equity, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of the cash dividends per share of our common stock declared by our board of directors for the three months ended Jun e 30, 2024 .

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operati ons" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness.

Our Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million and an unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions.

The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.10% to 0.55% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (each as defined in the Second Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.55% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified inves tment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). The interest rates applicable to loans under the Term Loan are, at the Operating Partnership's option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.20% per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.20% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Operating Partnership's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long-term unsecured debt). As of June 30, 2024, we had a $ 200.0 million Term Loan outstanding and had n o borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisitio n by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Increased inflation may also have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents.

Based on our outstanding debt balance as of June 30, 2024 described above and the interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt at June 30, 2024, assuming a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates related to our variable rate debt, interest expense would have increased approximately $1.4 million for the s ix months ended June 30, 2024.

## Table of Contents

We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT - Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities," which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, we had no swap agreements to hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

## Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of June 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 30, 2024.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Table of Contents

## PART II-OTHER INFORMATION

## Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

The Company and its subsidiaries are and may become from time to time a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, but none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is, and none of their respective properties are, the subject of any material legal proceedings. Claims and lawsuits may include matters involving general or professional liability asserted against its tenants, which are the responsibility of its tenants and for which the Company is entitled to be indemnified by its tenants under the insurance and indemnification provisions in the applicable leases.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We have disclosed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed, other than as set forth below.

## Any event that materially and adversely affects the business, financial position or results of operations of our borrowers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.

From time to time, we originate loans receivable to certain borrowers in the form of mortgage secured loans or mezzanine loans, which are directly or indirectly secured by underlying properties owned by the borrowers. The ability of our borrowers to repay the loans is typically dependent primarily on the successful operation of the properties securing the loans. Because these properties are owned and operated by our borrowers, their affiliates, or unrelated third parties, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions regarding the daily operation of these properties. Any failure by a borrower to effectively conduct its operations in such a way to generate sufficient income, or any material adverse event that interferes with a borrower's ability to generate sufficient income, may cause the borrower to be unable to make timely loan payments or to default on the loan.

In the event of any default under any loan receivable held by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal and accrued interest to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the underlying property directly or indirectly securing the loan and the principal and accrued interest of the loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, with respect to a default of any of our mezzanine loans, we are not entitled to any payment until all senior debt holders are paid in full. Foreclosure on a property or other interest that secures a loan receivable can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed investment. In the event of the bankruptcy of a loan borrower, the loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying property or other assets, as applicable, at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
