1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
----------------------------------------------------------

Rocket Companies, Inc. (the "Company", and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Rocket Companies", "we", "us", "our") was incorporated in Delaware on February 26, 2020 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Rock Holdings Inc. ("RHI") for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock, $0.00001 par value (the "Class A common stock") and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of RKT Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

We are a Detroit-based fintech company including mortgage, real estate and personal finance business.

We believe our widely recognized "Rocket" brand is synonymous with simple, fast, and trusted digital experiences. Through these businesses, we seek to deliver innovative client solutions leveraging our Rocket platform. Our business operations are organized into the following two segments: (1) Direct to Consumer and (2) Partner Network, refer to Note 11, Segments.

Rocket Companies, Inc. is a holding company. Its primary material asset is the equity interest in Holdings which, including through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, conducts a majority of the Company's operations. Holdings is a Michigan limited liability company and wholly owns the following entities, with each entity's subsidiaries identified in parentheses: Rocket Mortgage, LLC, Amrock Holdings, LLC ("Amrock"), Amrock Title Insurance Company ("ATI"), LMB HoldCo LLC ("Core Digital Media"), RCRA Holdings LLC (Rock Connections LLC dba "Rocket Connections"), Rocket Homes Real Estate LLC ("Rocket Homes"), RockLoans Holdings LLC ("Rocket Loans"), Rock Central LLC dba Rocket Central, Rocket Money, Inc.("Rocket Money"), Rocket Worldwide Holdings Inc.

Holdings is considered a variable interest entity ("VIE") and we consolidate the financial results of Holdings under the guidance of ASC 810, Consolidation.

For further details, refer below to Variable Interest Entities and Note 12 , Non-controlling Interest.

All significant intercompany transactions and accounts between the businesses comprising the Company have been eliminated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company's derivatives, IRLCs, MSRs, mortgage and non-mortgage loans held for sale, and trading investment securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, other assets may be required to be measured at fair value in the condensed consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. For further details of the Company's transactions refer to Note 2, Fair Value Measurements.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)

Our condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and presented in U.S. dollars. They have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. In our opinion, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. However, our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year or for any other future period.

Management Estimates
--------------------

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management is not currently aware of any factors that would significantly change its estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates.

Subsequent Events
-----------------

In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. Refer to Note 5, Borrowings for disclosures on changes to the Company's debt agreements that occurred subsequent to March 31, 2024. In addition, on May 7, 2024, Rocket Mortgage entered into a new Master Repurchase Agreement among Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., as buyer, Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, as agent and Rocket Mortgage as seller. The facility amount is $1.0 billion.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------

Gain on sale of loans, net - includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including (1) net gain on sale of loans, which represents the premium we receive in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of loans into the secondary market, (2) loan origination fees (credits), points and certain costs, (3) provision for or benefit from investor reserves, (4) the change in fair value of interest rate locks and loans held for sale, (5) the gain or loss on forward commitments hedging loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs), and (6) the fair value of originated MSRs. An estimate of the Gain on sale of loans, net is recognized at the time an IRLC is issued, net of a pull-through factor. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in current period earnings. When the mortgage loan is sold into the secondary market, any difference between the proceeds received and the current fair value of the loan is recognized in current period earnings in Gain on sale of loans, net. Included in Gain on sale of loans, net is the Fair value of originated MSRs, which represents the estimated fair value of MSRs related to loans which we have sold and retained the right to service. Refer to Note 3, Mortgage Servicing Rights for information related to the gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of MSRs.

Loan servicing income (loss), net - includes income from servicing, sub-servicing and ancillary fees, and is recorded to income as earned, which is upon collection of payments from borrowers. This amount also includes the Change in fair value of MSRs, which is the adjustment for the fair value measurement of the MSR asset as of the respective balance sheet date.

Interest income, net - includes interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loans held for investment net of the interest expense paid on our loan funding facilities. Interest income is recorded as earned and interest expense is recorded as incurred. Interest income is accrued and credited to income daily based on the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") outstanding. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due.

Other income - is derived primarily from deposit income, personal finance subscription revenue, closing fees, net appraisal revenue, net title insurance fees, personal loans business, real estate network referral fees, and professional service fees.

The following significant revenue streams fall within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and are disaggregated hereunder. The remaining revenue streams within the scope of ASC 606 are immaterial, both individually and in aggregate.

Rocket Money subscription revenue - The Company recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract. We have determined that subscriptions represent a stand-ready obligation to perform over the subscription term. These performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Contracts are one month to one year in length. Subscription revenues were $60,591 and $39,185 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Amrock closing fees - The Company recognizes closing fees for non-recurring services provided in connection with the origination of the loan. These fees are recognized at the time of loan closing for purchase transactions or at the end of a client's three-day rescission period for refinance transactions, which represents the point in time the loan closing services performance obligation is satisfied. The consideration received for closing services is a fixed fee per loan that varies by state and loan type. Closing fees were $21,512 and $17,488 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Amrock appraisal revenue, net - The Company recognizes appraisal revenue when the appraisal service is completed. The Company may choose to deliver appraisal services directly to its client or subcontract such services to a third-party licensed and/or certified appraiser. In instances where the Company performs the appraisal, revenue is recognized as the gross amount of consideration received at a fixed price per appraisal. The Company is an agent in instances where a third-party appraiser is involved in the delivery of appraisal services and revenue is recognized net of third-party appraisal expenses. Appraisal revenue, net of intercompany eliminations, were $8,857 and $11,866 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Rocket Homes real estate network referral fees - The Company recognizes real estate network referral fee revenue based on arrangements with partner agencies contingent on the closing of a transaction. As this revenue stream is variable, and is contingent on the successful transaction close, the revenue is constrained until the occurrence of the transaction. At this point, the constraint on recognizing revenue is deemed to have been lifted and revenue is recognized for the consideration expected to be received. Real estate network referral fees, net of intercompany eliminations, were $10,870 and $6,971 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
------------------------------------------

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain our bank accounts with a relatively small number of high-quality financial institutions.

Restricted cash as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of cash on deposit for a repurchase facility and client application deposits, title premiums collected from the insured that are due to the underwritten, and principal and interest received in collection accounts for purchased assets.

|  | March 31, | March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | $ 861,410 | $ 893,383 |
| Restricted cash | 31,975 | 64,307 |
| Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows | $ 893,385 | $ 957,690 |

Loans subject to repurchase right from Ginnie Mae
-------------------------------------------------

For certain loans sold to Ginnie Mae, the Company as the servicer has the unilateral right to repurchase any individual loan in a Ginnie Mae securitization pool if that loan meets defined criteria, including being delinquent more than 90 days. Once the Company has the unilateral right to repurchase the delinquent loan, the Company has effectively regained control over the loan and must re-recognize the loan on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and establish a corresponding finance liability regardless of the Company's intention to repurchase the loan. The asset and corresponding liability are recorded at the unpaid principal balance of the loan, which approximates its fair value.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
-------------------------------------

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01: Leases (Topic 842) - Common Control Arrangements. The new guidance requires all lessees in a lease with a lessor under common control to amortize leasehold improvements over the useful life of the common control group and provides new guidance for recognizing a transfer of assets between entities under common control as an adjustment to equity when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. There was no impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures upon adoption in January of 2024.

Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted
-----------------------------------------------

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures around significant segment expenses and the chief operating decision maker. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirements of the update, which is expected to result in expanded disclosures upon adoption.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures relating to the tax rate reconciliation and the income taxes paid information. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirements of the update, which is expected to result in expanded disclosures upon adoption.

2. Fair Value Measurements
--------------------------

Fair value is the price that would be received if an asset were sold or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date. Required disclosures include classification of fair value measurements within a three-level hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Classification of a fair value measurement within the hierarchy is dependent on the classification and significance of the inputs used to determine the fair value measurement. Observable inputs are those that are observed, implied from, or corroborated with externally available market information. Unobservable inputs represent the Company's estimates of market participants' assumptions.

Fair value measurements are classified in the following manner:

Level 1 -Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Rocket Companies, Inc.
----------------------

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)

Level 2 -Valuation is based on either observable prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, observable prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are derived directly from, or through correlation to, observable market data at the measurement date.

Level 3 -Valuation is based on the Company's internal models using assumptions at the measurement date that a market participant would use.

In determining fair value measurement, the Company uses observable inputs whenever possible. The level of a fair value measurement within the hierarchy is dependent on the lowest level of input that has a significant impact on the measurement as a whole. If quoted market prices are available at the measurement date or are available for similar instruments, such prices are used in the measurements. If observable market data is not available at the measurement date, judgment is required to measure fair value.

The following is a description of measurement techniques for items recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no material items recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Mortgage loans held for sale: Loans held for sale that trade in active secondary markets are valued using Level 2 measurements derived from observable market data, including market prices of securities backed by similar mortgage loans adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk. Loans held for sale for which there is little to no observable trading activity of similar instruments are valued using Level 3 measurements based upon dealer price quotes and internal models.

IRLCs: The fair value of IRLCs is based on current market prices of securities backed by similar mortgage loans (as determined above under mortgage loans held for sale), net of costs to close the loans, subject to the estimated loan funding probability, or "pull-through factor". Given the significant and unobservable nature of the pull-through factor, IRLCs are classified as Level 3.

MSRs: The fair value of MSRs is determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net future cash flows. The model includes estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, float earnings, and contractual servicing fee income, among others. MSRs are classified as Level 3.

Forward commitments: The Company's forward commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Investment securities: Investment securities are trading debt securities that are recorded at fair value using observable market prices for similar securities or identical securities that are traded in less active markets, which are classified as Level 2 and include highly rated municipal, government, and corporate bonds. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, these securities were classified as available for sale and then subsequently in 2023 transferred to trading securities which reflects the more active buying and selling of these investment securities.

Non-mortgage loans held for sale: Non-mortgage loans held for sale are personal loans, including loans to finance solar panel installation projects. The fair value of non-mortgage loans is determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net future cash flows. Non-mortgage loans are classified as Level 3.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
------------------------------------------------------------------

The table below shows a summary of financial statement items that are measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, including assets measured under the fair value option. There were no material transfers of assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.

Fair Value Option
-----------------

The following is the estimated fair value and UPB of mortgage and non-mortgage loans held for sale that have contractual principal amounts and for which the Company has elected the fair value option. The fair value option was elected for mortgage and non-mortgage loans held for sale as the Company believes fair value best reflects their expected future economic performance:

|  | Fair Value | Principal Amount Due Upon Maturity | Difference (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at March 31, 2024 |  |  |  |
| Mortgage loans held for sale | $ 9,416,229 | $ 9,283,728 | $ 132,501 |
| Non-mortgage loans held for sale | $ 197,661 | $ 205,171 | $ (7,510) |
| Balance at December 31, 2023 |  |  |  |
| Mortgage loans held for sale | $ 6,542,232 | $ 6,418,082 | $ 124,150 |
| Non-mortgage loans held for sale | $ 163,018 | $ 168,573 | $ (5,555) |

Disclosures of the fair value of certain financial instruments are required when it is practical to estimate the value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of financial liabilities that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. This table excludes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, warehouse borrowings, and line of credit borrowing facilities as these financial instruments are highly liquid or short-term in nature and as a result, their carrying amounts approximate fair value:

The fair value of Senior Notes was calculated using the observable bond price at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Senior Notes are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

3. Mortgage Servicing Rights
----------------------------

Mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when loans are sold, and the associated servicing rights are retained. The Company maintains one class of MSRs asset and has elected the fair value option. These MSRs are recorded at fair value, which is determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing fee income. The model includes estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, float earnings, and contractual servicing fee income, among others.

The following table summarizes changes to the MSR assets:

|  | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |
| Fair value, beginning of period | $ 6,439,787 | $ 6,946,940 |
| MSRs originated | 222,797 | 204,560 |
| MSRs sales | (51,344) | (81,538) |
| MSRs purchases | 16,695 | - |
| Changes in fair value: |  |  |
| Due to changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions (1) | 227,369 | (217,802) |
| Due to collection/realization of cash flows | (163,963) | (182,221) |
| Total changes in fair value | 63,406 | (400,023) |
| Fair value, end of period | $ 6,691,341 | $ 6,669,939 |

The Company retains the right to service a majority of these loans upon sale through ownership of servicing rights. The total UPB of mortgage loans serviced, excluding subserviced loans, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $468,544,964 and $468,237,971, respectively. The portfolio primarily consists of high-quality performing agency and government (FHA and VA) loans. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, delinquent loans (defined as 60-plus days past-due) were 1.17% and 1.23%, respectively, of our total portfolio.

Rocket Companies, Inc.
----------------------

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)

The following is a summary of the weighted average discount rate and prepayment speed assumptions used to determine the fair value of MSRs as well as the expected life of the loans in the servicing portfolio:

|  | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discount rate | 9.9 % | 9.9 % |
| Prepayment speeds | 7.5 % | 7.5 % |
| Life (in years) | 7.82 | 7.83 |

The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of MSRs are prepayment speeds and the discount rate. Increases in prepayment speeds generally have an adverse effect on the value of MSRs as the underlying loans prepay faster. In a declining interest rate environment, the fair value of MSRs generally decreases as prepayments increase and therefore, the estimated life of the MSRs and related cash flows decrease. Decreases in prepayment speeds generally have a positive effect on the value of MSRs as the underlying loans prepay less frequently. In a rising interest rate environment, the fair value of MSRs generally increases as prepayments decrease and therefore, the estimated life of the MSRs and related cash flows increase. Increases in the discount rate result in a lower MSRs value and decreases in the discount rate result in a higher MSRs value. MSRs uncertainties are hypothetical and do not always have a direct correlation with each assumption. Changes in one assumption may result in changes to another assumption, which might magnify or counteract the uncertainties.

The following sensitivity analysis shows the potential impact on the fair value of the Company's MSRs based on hypothetical changes in key assumptions, including the discount rate and prepayment speeds:

|  | Discount Rate | Discount Rate | Prepayment Speeds | Prepayment Speeds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 100 BPS Adverse Change | 200 BPS Adverse Change | 10% Adverse Change | 20% Adverse Change |
| March 31, 2024 |  |  |  |  |
| Mortgage servicing rights | $ (292,585) | $ (561,494) | $ (185,079) | $ (358,893) |
| December 31, 2023 |  |  |  |  |
| Mortgage servicing rights | $ (279,493) | $ (536,573) | $ (183,254) | $ (356,871) |

4. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
-------------------------------

The Company sells substantially all of its originated mortgage loans into the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are loans originated that are expected to be sold into the secondary market. Below is a roll forward of the activity in mortgage loans held for sale:

|  | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |

Credit Risk
-----------

The Company is subject to credit risk associated with mortgage loans that it purchases and originates during the period of time prior to the sale of these loans. The Company considers credit risk associated with these loans to be minimal as it holds the loans for a short period of time, which for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is generally less than 45 days from the date of borrowing, and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid. The Company is also subject to credit risk associated with mortgage loans it has repurchased as a result of breaches of representations and warranties during the period of time between repurchase and resale.

5. Borrowings
-------------

The Company maintains various funding facilities, financing facilities, and unsecured senior notes, as shown in the tables below. Interest rates typically have two main components; a base rate - most commonly SOFR, which is sometimes subject to a minimum floor, plus a spread. Some funding facilities have a commitment fee, which can be up to 50 basis points per year. The commitment fee charged by lenders is calculated based on the committed line amount multiplied by a negotiated rate. The Company is required to maintain certain covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity, maximum total debt or liabilities to net worth ratio, pretax net income requirements, and other customary debt covenants, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The amount owed and outstanding on the Company's loan funding facilities fluctuates based on its origination volume, the amount of time it takes the Company to sell the loans it originates, and the Company's ability to use its cash to self-fund loans. In addition to self-funding, the Company may use surplus cash to "buy-down" the effective interest rate of certain loan funding facilities or to self-fund a portion of our loan originations. Buy-down funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have the ability to withdraw these funds at any time, unless a margin call has been made or a default has occurred under the relevant facilities. We will also deploy cash to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which can be transferred to a mortgage loan funding facility or the early buy out line, provided that such loans meet the eligibility criteria to be placed on such lines. The remaining portion will be funded in normal course over a short period of time, generally less than 45 days.

The terms of the Senior Notes restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiary guarantors among other things to: (1) merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets, and; (2) create liens on assets.

6. Transactions with Related Parties
------------------------------------

The Company has entered into various transactions and agreements with RHI, its subsidiaries, certain other affiliates and related parties (collectively, "Related Parties"). These transactions include providing financing and services as well as obtaining financing and services from these Related Parties.

Financing Arrangements
----------------------

On June 9, 2017, Rocket Mortgage and RHI entered into an unsecured line of credit, as further amended and restated on September 16, 2021 ("RHI Line of Credit"), pursuant to which Rocket Mortgage has a borrowing capacity of $2,000,000. The RHI Line of Credit matures on July 27, 2025. Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum of the applicable base rate, plus a spread of 1.25%. The line of credit is uncommitted and RHI has sole discretion over advances. The RHI Line of Credit also contains negative covenants which restrict the ability of the Company to incur debt and create liens on certain assets. It also requires Rocket Mortgage to maintain a quarterly consolidated net income before taxes if adjusted tangible net worth meets certain requirements. The Company did not draw on the RHI Line of Credit during the period and there were no outstanding amounts due as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

RHI and ATI are parties to a surplus debenture, effective as of December 28, 2015, and as further amended and restated on July 31, 2023 (the "RHI/ATI Debenture"), pursuant to which ATI is indebted to RHI for an aggregate principal amount of $ 21,500. The RHI/ATI Debenture matures on December 31, 2030. Interest under the RHI/ATI Debenture accrues at an annual rate of 8%. Principal and interest under the RHI/ATI Debenture are due and payable quarterly, in each case subject to ATI achieving a certain amount of surplus and payments of all interest before principal payments begin. Any unpaid amounts of principal and interest shall be due and payable upon the maturity of the RHI/ATI Debenture. ATI repaid an aggregate of $ 434 and $250 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total amount of interest accrued was $429 and $424 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate amount due to RHI was $30,260 and $30,264 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

On July 31, 2020, Holdings and RHI entered into an agreement for an uncommitted, unsecured revolving line of credit ("RHI 2nd Line of Credit"), which will provide for financing from RHI to the Company of up to $100,000. The RHI 2nd Line of Credit matures on July 31, 2025. Borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at a rate per annum of the applicable base rate plus a spread of 1.25%. The negative covenants of the line of credit restrict the ability of the Company to incur debt and create liens on certain assets. The line of credit also contains customary events of default. There Company did not draw on the RHI 2nd Line of Credit during the period and there were no amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Notes receivable and due from affiliates was $18,574 and $19,530 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Notes payable and due to affiliates was $31,325 and $31,006 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Services, Products and Other Transactions
-----------------------------------------

We have entered into transactions and agreements to provide certain services to Related Parties. We recognized revenue of $1,646 and $2,316 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the performance of these services, which was included in Other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We have also entered into transactions and agreements to purchase certain services, products and other transactions from Related Parties. We incurred expenses of $625 and $499, which are included in Salaries, commissions and team member benefits; $12,222 and $11,771, which are included in General and administrative expenses; and $3,630 and $3,960, which are included in Marketing and advertising expenses, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Company has also entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with RHI and our Chairman as described further in Note 7, Income Taxes. The Company has also guaranteed the debt of a related party as described further in Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees.

Lease Transactions with Related Parties
---------------------------------------

The Company is a party to lease agreements for certain offices, including our headquarters in Detroit, with various affiliates of Bedrock Management Services LLC ("Bedrock"), a related party, and other related parties of the Company. The Company incurred expenses related to these arrangements of $ 19,570 and $17,897, which are included in General and administrative expenses, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

7. Income Taxes
---------------

The Company had income tax expense of $7,656 on Income before income taxes of $298,370 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company had an income tax benefit of $4,504 on Loss before income taxes of $415,987 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The Company's income tax expense varies from the expense that would be expected based on statutory rates due principally to its organizational structure. Rocket Companies owns a portion of the units of Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes and in most applicable jurisdictions for state and local income tax purposes. The remaining portion of Holdings is owned by RHI and our Chairman ("LLC Members"). As a partnership, Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by Holdings is passed through and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Rocket Companies, in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement of Holdings (the "Holdings Operating Agreement"). Rocket Companies is a C Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of Holdings.

Several subsidiaries of Holdings, such as Rocket Mortgage, Amrock and other subsidiaries, are single member LLC entities. As single member LLCs of Holdings, all taxable income or loss generated by these subsidiaries passes through and is included in the income or loss of Holdings. A pro vision for state and local income taxes is required for certain jurisdictions that tax single member LLCs as regarded entities. Oth er subsidiaries of Holdings, such as Amrock Title Insurance Co., LMB Mortgage Services and others, are treated as C Corporations and separately file and pay taxes apart from Holdings in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state, local and Canada.

Tax Receivable Agreement
------------------------

The Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Holdings when Holdings Units are redeemed from or exchanged by the LLC Members. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of Holdings Units as direct purchases of Holdings Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.

Rocket Companies, Inc.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)

The Company previously entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the "Tax Receivable Agreement") with the LLC Members that will obligate the Company to make payments to the LLC Members generally equal to 90% of the applicable cash tax savings that the Company actually realizes or in some cases is deemed to realize as a result of the tax attributes generated by (i) certain increases in our allocable share of the tax basis in Holdings' assets resulting from (a) the purchases of Holdings Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock) from the LLC Members (or their transferees of Holdings Units or other assignees) using the net proceeds from our initial public offering or in any future offering, (b) exchanges by the LLC Members (or their transferees of Holdings Units or other assignees) of Holdings Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock) for cash or shares of our Class B common stock or Class A common stock, as applicable, or (c) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement; (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) disproportionate allocations (if any) of tax benefits to Holdings as a result of section 704(c) of the Code that relate to the reorganization transactions. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 10% of these tax savings.

No payment was made to the LLC Members pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2024. A payment of $35,697 was made to the LLC Members pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of Rocket Companies in the future. Any such changes in these factors or changes in the Company's determination of the need for a valuation allowance related to the tax benefits acquired under the Tax Receivable Agreement could adjust the Tax receivable agreement liability recognized and recorded within earnings in future periods.

Tax Distributions
-----------------

The holders of Holdings' Units, including Rocket Companies Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their share of any taxable income of Holdings. The Holdings Operating Agreement provides for pro rata cash distributions ("tax distributions") to the holders of the Holdings Units in an amount generally calculated to provide each holder of Holdings Units with sufficient cash to cover its tax liability in respect of the Holdings Units. In general, these tax distributions are computed based on Holdings' estimated taxable income, multiplied by an assumed tax rate as set forth in the Holdings Operating Agreement.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, Holdings hasnot paid material tax distributions to holders of Holdings Units other than Rocket Companies.

8. Derivative Financial Instruments
-----------------------------------

The Company uses forward commitments to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain fixed and adjustable rate commitments. Utilization of forward commitments involves some degree of basis risk. Basis risk is defined as the risk that the hedged instrument's price does not move in parallel with the increase or decrease in the market price of the hedged financial instrument. The Company calculates an expected hedge ratio to mitigate a portion of this risk. The Company's derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedging instruments, and therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in current period Net income (loss). Hedging gains and losses are included in Gain on sale of loans, net and Change in fair value of MSRs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Net hedging gains and losses were as follows:

|  | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |
| Hedging gains (losses) (1) | 63,770 | (79,133) |

Refer to Note 2, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

Notional and Fair Value
-----------------------

The notional and fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments were as follows:

|  | Notional Value | Derivative Asset | Derivative Liability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance at March 31, 2024: |  |  |  |
| IRLCs, net of loan funding probability (1) | $ 7,331,097 | $ 202,873 | $ - |
| Forward commitments (2) | $ 14,008,897 | $ 496 | $ 22,785 |
| Balance at December 31, 2023: |  |  |  |
| IRLCs, net of loan funding probability (1) | $ 4,728,040 | $ 132,870 | $ - |
| Forward commitments (2) | $ 9,650,041 | $ 26,614 | $ 142,988 |

Counterparty agreements for forward commitments contain master netting agreements.The table below presents the gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities subject to master netting agreements. Margin cash is cash that is exchanged by counterparties to be held as collateral related to these derivative financial instruments. Margin cash held on behalf of counterparties is recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, and the related liability is classified in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Margin cash pledged to counterparties is excluded from Cash and cash equivalents and instead recorded in Other assets as a margin call receivable from counterparties in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $16,489 and $66,598 of margin cash pledged to counterparties related to these forward commitments at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $ 950 and $250 of margin cash held on behalf of counterparties, respectively.

|  | Gross Amount of Recognized Assets or Liabilities | Gross Amounts Offset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets | Net Amounts Presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offsetting of Derivative Assets |  |  |  |
| Balance at March 31, 2024: |  |  |  |
| Forward commitments | $ 777 | $ (281) | $ 496 |
| Balance at December 31, 2023: |  |  |  |
| Forward commitments | $ 37,647 | $ (11,033) | $ 26,614 |

| Balance at December 31, 2023: |  |  |  |
| Forward commitments | $ (174,545) | $ 31,557 | $ (142,988) |

Counterparty Credit Risk
------------------------

Credit risk is defined as the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract, which exceeds the value of existing collateral, if any. The Company attempts to limit its credit risk by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate.

Rocket Companies, Inc.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of contractual nonperformance by its trading counterparties and counterparties to its various over-the-counter derivative financial instruments noted in the above Notional and Fair Value discussion. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty, and entering into netting agreements with the counterparties as appropriate.

Certain counterparties have master netting agreements. The master netting agreements contain a legal right to offset amounts due to and from the same counterparty. Derivative assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of loss positions with the same counterparty and, therefore, also represent the Company's maximum counterparty credit risk. The Company incurred no credit losses due to nonperformance of any of its counterparties during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

9. Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees
---------------------------------------------

Interest Rate Lock Commitments
------------------------------

IRLCs are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each client's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.

The number of days from the date of the IRLC to expiration of fixed and variable rate lock commitments outstanding at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was41 days on average.

The UPB of IRLCs was as follows:

|  | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Fixed Rate | Variable Rate | Fixed Rate | Variable Rate |
| IRLCs | $ 9,448,679 | $ 365,726 | $ 6,317,330 | $ 258,045 |

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts to sell existing mortgage loans held for sale into the secondary market at specified future dates. The amount of commitments to sell existing loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $1,007,379 and zero, respectively.

Commitments to Sell Loans with Servicing Released
-------------------------------------------------

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contracts to sell the MSRs of certain newly originated loans on a servicing released basis. In the event that a forward commitment is not filled and there has been an unfavorable market shift from the date of commitment to the date of settlement, the Company is contractually obligated to pay a pair-off fee on the undelivered balance. There were $423,752 and $226,535 of loans committed to be sold servicing released at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Investor Reserves

The following presents the activity in the investor reserves:

|  | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |
| Balance at beginning of period | $ 92,389 | $ 110,147 |

The maximum exposure under the Company's representations and warranties would be the outstanding principal balance and any premium received on all loans ever sold by the Company, less (i) loans that have already been paid in full by the mortgagee, (ii) loans that have defaulted without a breach of representations and warranties, (iii) loans that have been indemnified via settlement or make-whole, or (iv) loans that have been repurchased. Additionally, the Company may receive relief of certain representation and warranty obligations on loans sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac on or after January 1, 2013 if Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac satisfactorily concludes a quality control loan file review or if the borrower meets certain acceptable payment history requirements within 12 or 36 months after the loan is sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

Escrow Deposits
---------------

As a service to its clients, the Company administers escrow deposits representing undisbursed amounts received for payment of property taxes, insurance, funds for title services, principal, and interest on loans held for sale. Cash held by the Company for property taxes, insurance and settlement funds for title services was $4,287,627 and $3,469,770, and for principal and interest was $2,777,791 and $2,225,625 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are excluded from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company remains contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits.

Guarantees
----------

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company guaranteed the debt of a related party consisting ofthree separate guarantees totaling $1,328 and $1,770, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record a liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these guarantees because it was not probable that the Company would be required to make payments under these guarantees.

Plus, if a judgment for money that exceeds specified thresholds is rendered against a subsidiary of Rocket Companies or against Rocket Companies and it or they fail to timely pay, discharge, bond or obtain a stay of execution of such judgment, it is possible that one or more of the companies could be deemed in default of loan funding facilities and other agreements governing indebtedness. If the final resolution in one or more of these proceedings is unfavorable, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations of Rocket Companies.

11. Segments
------------

The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as its Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), has evaluated how the Company views and measures its performance. ASC 280, Segment Reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in that guidance, the Company has determined that it has two reportable segments - Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the Company's internal operations and the nature of its marketing channels, which drive client acquisition into the mortgage platform. This determination reflects how its CODM monitors performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions.

Direct to Consumer
------------------

In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with Rocket Mortgage online and/or with the Company's mortgage bankers. The Company markets to potential clients in this segment through various brand campaigns and performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. The segment also includes title insurance, appraisals and settlement services complementing the Company's end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment and are viewed as an extension of the client experience. Servicing enables Rocket Mortgage to establish and maintain long term relationships with our clients, through multiple touchpoints at regular engagement intervals.

Revenues in the Direct to Consumer segment are generated primarily from the gain on sale of loans, which includes loan origination fees, revenues associated with title insurance, appraisals and settlement services, and revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market, as well as the fair value of originated MSRs and hedging gains and losses. Loan servicing income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing loans and other ancillary servicing fees, as well as changes in the fair value of MSRs due to changes in valuation assumptions and realization of cash flows.

Partner Network
---------------

The Rocket Professional platform supports our Partner Network segment, where we leverage our superior client service and widely recognized brand to grow marketing and influencer relationships, and our mortgage broker partnerships through Rocket Pro TPO ("third party origination"). Our marketing partnerships consist of wellknown consumer-focused companies that find value in our award-winning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient mortgage process, where mortgages may not be their primary offering. We also enable clients to start the mortgage process through the Rocket platform in the way that works best for them, including through a local mortgage broker.

Revenues in the Partner Network segment are generated primarily from the gain on sale of loans, which includes loan origination fees, revenues associated with title insurance, appraisals and settlement services, and revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market, as well as the fair value of originated MSRs and hedging gains and losses.

Other Information About Our Segments
------------------------------------

The Company measures the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. The accounting policies applied by our segments are described in Note 1, Business, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies . Directly attributable expenses include Salaries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses and Other expenses, such as servicing costs and origination costs.

The Company does not allocate assets to its reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is managed on a consolidated basis and is not used in the context of segment reporting.

The Company also reports an "All Other" category that includes operations from Rocket Money, Rocket Loans, Rocket Homes and includes professional service fee revenues from related parties. These operations are neither significant individually nor in aggregate and therefore do not constitute a reportable segment.

12. Non-controlling Interest
----------------------------

The non-controlling interest balance represents the economic interest in Holdings held by our Chairman and RHI.The following table summarizes the ownership of Holdings Units in Holdings as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

|  | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Holdings Units | Ownership Percentage | Holdings Units | Ownership Percentage |
| Rocket Companies, Inc.'s ownership of Holdings Units | 138,811,617 | 6.98 % | 135,814,173 | 6.84 % |
| Holdings Units held by our Chairman | 1,101,822 | 0.06 % | 1,101,822 | 0.06 % |
| Holdings Units held by RHI | 1,847,777,661 | 92.96 % | 1,847,777,661 | 93.10 % |
| Balance at end of period | 1,987,691,100 | 100.00 % | 1,984,693,656 | 100.00 % |

The non-controlling interest holders have the right to exchange Holdings Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock (together referred to as "Paired Interests"), for, at our option, (i) shares of our Class B common stock or Class A common stock or (ii) cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of our Class A common stock). As such, future exchanges of Paired Interests by noncontrolling interest holders will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in-capital when Holdings has positive or negative net assets, respectively. During the periods presented, neither our Chairman or RHI has exchanged any Paired Interests.

13. Share-based Compensation
----------------------------

Restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock options are granted to team members and directors of the Company and its affiliates under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, with forfeitures recognized as they occur.

The Company granted approximately 10,500,000 restricted stock units with an estimated future expense of $131,400 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. These awards generally vest semi-annually over a three-year period, subject to the grantee's employment or service with the Company through each applicable vesting date.

Additionally, the Company authorized approximately 1,100,000 performance stock units at target that will vest based on the satisfaction of certain market, performance and service conditions. As of March 31, 2024, the estimated future expense of the awards is $17,300. A portion of the performance stock units will cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on the satisfaction of certain market and service conditions. The fair value of the award is determined based on a Monte Carlo valuation model. The remaining portion of the performance stock units will cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on the satisfaction of certain performance and service conditions, which will be established by the Company at a future date. The Company has determined that the service inception date precedes the grant date and the fair value of these awards will be remeasured quarterly based on the current period share price until the awards are granted. This portion of the performance stock units are not considered contingently issuable and are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as of March 31, 2024.

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan, also referred to as the Team Member Stock Purchase Plan ("TMSPP"), under which eligible team members may direct the Company to withhold up to 15% of their gross pay to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to85% of the closing market price on the exercise date. The TMSPP is a liability classified compensatory plan and the Company recognizes compensation expense over the offering period based on the fair value of the purchase discount. The number of shares purchased by team members through the TMSPP were 645,826 and 878,817, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries have individual compensation plans that include equity awards and stock appreciation rights.

| Subsidiary plans | 110 | 5 |
| Total share-based compensation expense | $ 30,997 | $ 51,960 |

14. Earnings Per Share
----------------------

The Company applies the two-class method for calculating and presenting earnings per share by separately presenting earnings per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In applying the two-class method, the Company allocates undistributed earnings equally on a per share basis between Class A and Class B common stock. According to the Company's certificate of incorporation, the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to participate in earnings equally on a per-share basis, as if all shares of common stock were of a single class, and in dividends as may be declared by the board of directors. Holders of the Class A and Class B common stock also have equal priority in liquidation. Shares of Class C and Class D common stock do not participate in earnings of Rocket Companies, Inc. As a result, the shares of Class C and Class D common stock are not considered participating securities and are not included in the weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of earnings per share. Restricted stock units awarded as part of the Company's compensation program are included in the weighted-average Class A shares outstanding in the calculation of basic earnings per share once the units are fully vested.

Basic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing Net income (loss) attributable to Rocket Companies by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing Net income (loss) attributable to Rocket Companies by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. There was no Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2024 or 2023.See Note 12, Non-controlling Interest for a description of Paired Interests and their potential impact on Class A and Class B share ownership.

Diluted earnings per share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from share-based awards and Class D common stock. The treasury stock method is used to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards, which assumes the proceeds upon vesting or exercise of awards would be used to purchase common stock at the average price for the period. The if-converted method is used to calculate the dilutive effect of converting Class D common stock to Class A common stock.

To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively "our non-GAAP financial measures") as non-GAAP measures which management believes provide useful information to investors. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income (loss), or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define our non-GAAP financial measures differently, and as a result, our measures of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on these measures for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, these measures allow management to compare our results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.

We define "Adjusted revenue" as total revenues net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges. We define "Adjusted net income (loss)" as tax-effected net income (loss) before share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, and the tax effects of those adjustments as applicable. We define "Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share" as Adjusted net income (loss) divided by the diluted weighted average number of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, which assumes the pro forma exchange and conversion of all outstanding Class D common stock for Class A common stock. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income (loss) before interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, and the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges.

We exclude from each of our non-GAAP financial measures the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, as this represents a non-cash non-realized adjustment to our total revenues, reflecting changes in assumptions including discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in market interest rates, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operation. We also exclude effects of contractual prepayment protection associated with sales of MSRs. Adjusted EBITDA includes Interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of Interest income, net, as these expenses are a direct cost driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Our definitions of each of our non-GAAP financial measures allow us to add back certain cash and non-cash charges, and deduct certain gains that are included in calculating Total revenue, net, Net income (loss) attributable to Rocket Companies or Net income (loss). However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. From time to time in the future, we may include or exclude other items if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors.

Although we use our non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Our nonGAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures included, but are not limited to:

* (a) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
* (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt;
* (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and
* (d) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We compensate for these limitations by using our non-GAAP financial measures along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. See below for reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Additionally, our U.S. GAAP-based measures can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

Key Performance Indicators
--------------------------

We monitor a number of key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of our business operations. Our loan production key performance indicators enable us to monitor our ability to generate gain on sale revenue as well as understand how our performance compares to the total mortgage origination market. Our servicing portfolio key performance indicators enable us to monitor the overall size of our servicing portfolio of business, the related value of our mortgage servicing rights, and the health of the business as measured by the average MSR delinquency rate. Other key performance indicators for other Rocket Companies, besides Rocket Mortgage ( "Other Rocket Companies" ), allow us to monitor both revenues and unit sales generated by these businesses. We include Rocket Money paid subscriptions, as we believe the metric is a key indicator of growth and revenue. We also include Rockethomes.com average unique monthly visits, as we believe traffic on the site is an indicator of consumer interest.

* (3) This metric measures our retention across a greater percentage of our client bases versus our recapture rate. We define"net c lient retention rate " as the number of clients that were active at the beginning of a period and which remain active at the end of the period, divided by the number of clients that were active at the beginning of the period. This metric excludes clients whose loans were sold during the period as well as clients to whom we did not actively market to due to contractual prohibitions or other business reasons. We define "a ctive " as those clients who do not pay-off their mortgage with us and originate a new mortgage with another lender during the period.
* ( 4 ) Rockethomes.com average unique monthly visits is calculated by a third party service that monitors website and app engagement activity. This metric doesn't necessarily have a direct correlation to revenues and is used primarily to monitor consumer interest in the Rockethomes.com site and app.
* (5) Net revenue presented above is calculated as gross revenues less intercompany revenue eliminations, as a portion of the Select Other Rocket Companies revenues is generated through intercompany transactions. T hese intercompany transactions take place with entities that are part of our platform. Consequently, we view gross revenue of individual Select Other Rocket Companies as a key performance indicator, and we consider net revenue of Select Other Rocket Companies on a combined basis.

Description of Certain Components of Financial Data
---------------------------------------------------

Components of Revenue
---------------------

Our sources of revenue include Gain on sale of loans, net, Loan servicing income (loss), net, Interest income, net, and Other income.

Gain on sale of loans, net
--------------------------

Gain on sale of loans, net includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including (1) net gain on sale of loans, which represents the premium we receive in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of loans into the secondary market, (2) loan origination fees, credits, points and certain costs, (3) provision for or benefit from investor reserves, (4) the change in fair value of interest rate locks ("IRLCs" or "rate lock") and loans held for sale, (5) the gain or loss on forward commitments hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs, and (6) the fair value of originated MSRs. MSR a ssets are created at the time Mortgage Loans Held for Sale are securitized and sold to investors for cash, while the Company retains the right to service the loan.

Loan servicing income (loss), net
---------------------------------

Loan servicing fee income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing the loans and includes ancillary revenue such as late fees and modification incentives. Loan servicing fee income is recorded to income as earned, which is upon collection of payments from borrowers. We have elected to measure the MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes in fair value of MSRs, net primarily due to the realization of expected cash flows and/or changes in valuation inputs and estimates, are recognized in current period earnings.

Interest income, net
--------------------

Interest income, net is interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale net of the interest expense paid on our loan funding facilities.

Other income
------------

Other income i ncludes revenues generated from R ocket Money (personal finance subscription revenue), Amrock (title insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services), Rocket Loans (personal loans), Rocket Homes (real estate network referral fees), deposit income related to revenue earned on deposits, including escrow deposits, and professional service fees. The professional service fees represent amounts received in exchange for professional services provided to affiliated companies. Services are provided primarily in connection with technology, facilities, human resources, accounting, training, and security functions. Other income also includes revenues from investment interest income and other miscellaneous income items.

Components of operating expenses
--------------------------------

Our operating expenses as presented in the statement of operations data includeSal aries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses, Marketing and advertising expenses, Interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt, and Other expenses.

Salaries, commissions and team member benefits
----------------------------------------------

Salaries, commissions and team member benefits include all payroll, benefits, and share-based compensation expenses for our team members.

General and administrative expenses
-----------------------------------

General and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy costs, professional services, loan processing expenses on loans that do not close or that are not charged to clients on closed loans, commitment fees, fees on loan funding facilities, license fees, office expenses and other operating expenses.

Marketing and advertising expenses
----------------------------------

Marketing and advertising expenses a re primarily related to performance and brand marketing.

Interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt
-----------------------------------------------------

Interest and amortization expense related to our Senior Notes.

Other expenses
--------------

Other expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization on property and equipment, mortgage servicing related expenses, and expenses generated from Amrock (title insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services).

Income taxes
------------

In calculating the provision for interim income taxes, in accordance with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. At the end of each interim period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. Tax-effects of significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur.

Tax Receivable Agreement
------------------------

Refer to Note 7 , Income Taxes for more information on Tax Receivable Agreement.

Share-based compensation
------------------------

Share-based compensation is comprised of both equity and liability awards and is measured and expensed accordingly under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation . As indicated above, share-based compensation expense is included as part of salaries, benefits and team member benefits.

Non-controlling interest
------------------------

We are the sole managing member of Holdings and consolidate the financial results of Holdings. Therefore, we report a non-controlling interest based on the Holdings Units of Holdings held by Dan Gilbert, our founder and Chairman (our "Chairman") and RHI on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income or loss is attributed to the non-controlling interests based on the weighted average Holdings Units outstanding during the period and is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Refer to Note 12, Non-controlling Interest for more information on non-controlling interests.

Overview of the Gain on sale of loans, net table
------------------------------------------------

At the time an IRLC is issued, an estimate of the Gain on sale of loans, net is recognized in the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the table above. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in this same component as the loan progresses through closing, which is the moment that loans move from an IRLC to a loan held for sale, and ultimately through the sale of the loan. We deploy a hedge strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes from the point of the IRLC through the sale of the loan. The changes to the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs in each period is dependent on several factors, including mortgage origination volume, how long a loan remains at a given stage in the origination process and the movement of interest rates during that period as compared to the immediately preceding period. Loans originated during an increasing rate environment generally decrease in value, and loans originated during a decreasing rate environment generally increase in value. When the mortgage loan is sold into the secondary market, any difference between the proceeds received and the current fair value of the loan is recognized and moves from the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the Net gain on sale of loans component in the table above. The Revaluation gain from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs component reflects the forward hedge commitments intended to offset the various fair value adjustments that impact the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs and the Net gain on sale of loans components. As a result, these three components should be evaluated in combination when evaluating Gain on sale of loans, net, as the sum of these components are primarily driven by net rate lock volume. Furthermore, at the point of sale of the loan, the Fair value of originated MSRs and the Provision for investor reserves are recognized each in their respective components shown above.

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Gain on sale of loans, net was $699.2 million, an increase of $229.7 million, or 49%, compared to $469.6 million for the same period in 2023.

Net gain on sale of loans, Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs and Revaluation from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs increased $175.8 million, or 56%, due to a 30% increase in gain on sale margin, primarily driven by contracting market capacity, and increased net rate lock volume of 14% during the period.

The fair value of MSRs originated was $222.8 million, an increase of $18.2 million, or 9%, compared to $204.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sold loan volume of $1.4 billion, or 9%, from $15.4 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion in 2024.

The Provision for investor reserves is our estimate of losses on potential future repurchases of loans previously sold. The $35.7 million decrease in provision was primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on re-sold loans in the current period compared to the same period in 2023.

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Loan servicing income (loss), net was $402.3 million, an increase of $434.1 million, which compares to a $31.9 million loss for the same period in 2023. The changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions resulted in a $226.8 million increase in 2024, compared to a $218.5 million decrease in 2023, driven by increasing interest rates in 2024 compared to decreasing interest rates in the same period in 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease of $20.6 million in servicing fee income in 2024, compared to $366.4 million in 2023, driven by a decrease in the average portfolio size during 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

Interest income, net
--------------------

The components of Interest income, net for the periods presented were as follows:

|  | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ($ in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 |
| Interest income | $ 88,980 | 66,744 |
| Interest expense on funding facilities | (51,443) | (35,112) |
| Interest income, net | $ 37,537 | 31,632 |

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Interest income, net was $37.5 million, an increase of $5.9 million, or 19%, compared to $31.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in Interest income, net in 2024 was primarily driven by higher sold loan volume, partially offset by increased interest expense on funding facilities driven by increased utilization.

Other income

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Other income was $244.7 million, an increase of $47.9 million, or 24%, compared to $196.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily a result of a $22.8 million, or 50%, increase in revenues at Rocket Money, due to an increase in paid subscriptions. The increase was also driven by an increase of $7.2 million, or 10%, of deposit interest income, attributable to higher interest earnings rates.

Expenses

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Total expenses were $1.1 billion, which were flat compared with $1.1 billion for the same period in 2023. Salaries, commissions and team member benefits were $541.1 million in 2024, a decrease of $62.7 million or 10%, compared with $603.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in team members in production roles. General and administrative expenses were $236.7 million, an increase of $41.3 million or 21%, compared with $195.4 million for the same period in 2023, driven primarily by an increase in loan processing costs, due to higher production levels. Marketing and advertising expenses were $206.3 million, an increase of $24.7 million, or 14%, compared with $181.6 million for the same period in 2023, which was driven by an increase in performance marketing in 2024.

Summary Results by Segment for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our operations are organized by distinct marketing channels which promote client acquisition and are categorized under two reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with the Rocket Mortgage app and/or with our mortgage bankers, consisting of sales team members across our platform. We market to potential clients in this segment through various performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. This also includes providing title insurance services, appraisals and settlement services to these clients as part of our end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment as they are viewed as an extension of the client experience with the primary objective to establish and maintain positive, regular touchpoints with our clients, which positions us to have high retention and recapture the clients' next refinance, purchase, and personal loan transactions. These activities position us to be the natural choice for clients' next refinance or purchase transaction.

The Rocket Professional platform supports our Partner Network segment, where we leverage our superior client service and widely recognized brand to grow marketing and influencer relationships, and our mortgage broker partnerships through Rocket Pro TPO. Our marketing partnerships consist of well-known consumer-focused companies that find value in our award-winning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient mortgage process, where mortgages may not be their primary offering. We also enable clients to start the mortgage process through the Rocket platform in the way that works best for them, including through a local mortgage broker. Rocket Pro TPO works exclusively with mortgage brokers, community banks and credit unions. Rocket Pro TPO's partners provide the face-to-face service their clients desire, while tapping into the expertise, technology and award-winning process of Rocket Mortgage.

We measure the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. Contribution margin is intended to measure the direct profitability of each segment and is calculated as Adjusted Revenue less directly attributable expenses. Adjusted revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure described above. Directly attributable expenses include Salaries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses, Marketing and advertising expenses and Other expenses, such as direct servicing costs and origination costs. For segments, we measure gain on sale margin of sold loans and refer to this metric as 'sold loan gain on sale margin.' A loan is considered sold when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. Sold loan gain on sale margin reflects the gain on sale revenue of loans sold into the secondary market divided by the sold loan volume for the period. By contrast, 'gain on sale margin', which we reference outside of the segment discussion, measures the gain on sale revenue, net divided by net rate lock volume for the period. See below for our overview and discussion of segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. For additional discussion, see Note 11, Segments of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q.

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Direct to Consumer Adjusted revenue was $873.4 million, an increase of $159.7 million, or 22%, compared to $713.7 million for the same period in 2023. Gain on sale revenue increased $149.8 million, or 38%, due to an increase in gain on sale margin, primarily driven by contracting market capacity, and an increase in net rate lock volume during the period. The change in fair value of MSRs was $56.5 million, an increase of $454.8 million, or 114%, compared to $(398.3) million in the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in the change in fair value due to changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions in 2024. Additionally, other income increased $9.6 million, or 8%, to $132.2 million, resulting from an increase in deposit interest income due to higher interest earnings rates.

Direct to Consumer directly attributable expenses increased $24.2 million, or 5%, to $529.8 million, compared to $505.6 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased loan processing costs and increased marketing spend, associated with higher volumes.

Direct to Consumer contribution margin increased $135.5 million, or 65%, to $343.6 million, compared to $208.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in contribution margin was driven primarily by an increase in gain on sale revenue, as described above, partially offset by an increase in directly attributable expenses, as described above.

Three months ended March 31, 2024 summary
-----------------------------------------

Partner Network Adjusted revenue was $170.3 million, an increase of $81.7 million, or 92%, compared to $88.5 million for the same period in 2023. Gain on sale revenue increased $77.5 million, or 108%, due to an increase in gain on sale margin, primarily driven by contracting market capacity, and increased net rate lock volume during the period.

Partner Network directly attributable expenses decreased $9.4 million, or 14%, to $55.9 million compared to $65.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decline was driven primarily by fewer team members and lower variable compensation.

Partner Network contribution margin increased $91.2 million, or 393%, to $114.3 million compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in contribution margin was driven primarily by the increase in gain on sale margin noted above, coupled with an increase in interest income and decrease in directly attributable expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have included:

* · cash flow from our operations, including:
* · sale of whole loans into the secondary market;
* · sale of mortgage servicing rights and excess servicing cash flows into the secondary market;
* · loan origination fees;
* · servicing fee income; and
* · interest income on loans held for sale
* · borrowings, including under our funding facilities; financing facilities; unsecured senior notes; and
* · cash and marketable securities on hand.

Historically, our primary uses of funds have included:

* · origination of loans;
* · interest expense;
* · repayment of debt;
* · operating expenses;
* · acquisition of mortgage servicing rights; and
* · distributions to RHI including those to fund distributions for payment of taxes by RHI shareholders.

We are also subject to contingencies which may have a significant impact on the use of our cash.

In order to originate and aggregate loans for sale into the secondary market, we use our own working capital and borrow or obtain money on a short-term basis primarily through committed and uncommitted funding facilities, generally established with large global banks.

Our funding facilities are primarily in the form of master repurchase agreements. We also have funding facilities directly with the GSEs. Loans financed under these facilities are generally financed at approximately 97% to 98% of the principal balance of the loan (although certain types of loans are financed at lower percentages of the principal balance of the loan), which requires us to fund the balance from cash generated from operations. Once closed, the underlying residential mortgage loan that is held for sale is pledged as collateral for the borrowing or advance that was made under these funding facilities. In most cases, the loans will remain in one of the funding facilities for only a short time, generally less than 45 days, until the loans are pooled and sold. During the time the loans are held for sale, we earn interest income from the borrower on the underlying mortgage loan. This income is partially offset by the interest and fees we have to pay under the funding facilities.

When we sell a pool of loans in the secondary market, the proceeds received from the sale of the loans are used to pay back the amounts we owe on the funding facilities. We rely on the cash generated from the sale of loans to fund future loans and repay borrowings under our funding facilities. Delays or failures to sell loans in the secondary market could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position.

As discussed in Note 5, Borrowings , of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as of March 31, 2024, we had 15 different funding and financing facilities in different amounts and with various maturities together with the Senior Notes. At March 31, 2024, the aggregate available amount under our facilities was $21.3 billion, with combined outstanding balances of $6.3 billion and unutilized capacity of $15.0 billion. We continue to optimize our funding and financing facilities and early in the second quarter we entered into a new Master Repurchase Agreement ( " MRA " ), resulting in an increase in overall borrowing capacity of approximately $1.0 billion. See Item 5, " Other Information " in Part II of this report for additional information.

The amount of financing actually advanced on each individual loan under our funding facilities, as determined by agreed upon advance rates, may be less than the stated advance rate depending, in part, on the market value of the mortgage loans securing the financings. Each of our funding facilities allows the bank providing the funds to evaluate the market value of the loans that are serving as collateral for the borrowings or advances being made. If the bank determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, the bank can require us to provide additional collateral or reduce the amount outstanding with respect to those loans (e.g., initiate a margin call). Our inability or unwillingness to satisfy the request could result in the termination of the facilities and possible default under our other funding facilities. In addition, a large unanticipated margin call could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

The amount owed and outstanding on our funding facilities fluctuates significantly based on our origination volume, the amount of time it takes us to sell the loans we originate, and the amount of loans being self-funded with cash. We may from time to time use surplus cash to "buy-down" the effective interest rate of certain funding facilities or to self-fund a portion of our loan originations. Buy-down funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have the ability to withdraw these funds at any time, unless a margin call has been made or a default has occurred under the relevant facilities. We will also deploy cash to selffund loan originations, a portion of which can be transferred to a warehouse line or the early buy out line, provided that such loans meet the eligibility criteria to be placed on such lines. The remaining portion will be funded in normal course over a short period of time, generally less than 45 days .

We remain in a strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of $8.9 billion as of March 31, 2024, which includes $0.9 billion of Cash and cash equivalents, $2.6 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which could be transferred to funding facilities (warehouse lines) at our discretion, $3.4 billion of undrawn lines of credit from financing facilities, and $2.0 billion of undrawn MSR lines. Margin cash held on behalf of counterparties is recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, and the related liability is classified in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Margin cash pledged to counterparties is excluded from Cash and cash equivalents and instead recorded in Other assets, as a receivable, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our funding facilities, early buy out facilities, MSRs facilities and unsecured lines of credit also generally require us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and the availability of funds under these facilities is subject to, among other conditions, our continued compliance with these covenants. These financial covenants include, but are not limited to, maintaining (1) a certain minimum tangible net worth, (2) minimum liquidity, (3) a maximum ratio of total liabilities or total debt to tangible net worth and (4) pre-tax net income requirements. A breach of these covenants can result in an event of default under these facilities and as such allows the lenders to pursue certain remedies. In addition, each of these facilities, as well as our unsecured lines of credit, includes cross default or cross acceleration provisions that could result in all facilities terminating if an event of default or acceleration of maturity occurs under any facility. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Basel lll
---------

In the third quarter 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the Basel III Capital Rules. We are not directly impacted by this proposal as we are not a bank. However, we are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact, if any, on the Company.

March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023
-----------------------------------------

Cash Flows
----------

Our Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash were $893.4 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $64.3 million, or 7%, compared to $957.7 million at March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in utilization of cash to self-fund loan originations, partially offset by an increase in MSR sales during the period.

Equity
------

Equity was $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $500.1 million, or 6%, compared to $8.1 billion as of March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of net income of $312.1 million, as well as an increase in share-based compensation of $155.1 million.

Distributions
-------------

During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material dividend or tax distributions. Except for tax distributions, these distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors.

Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, and Other Contingencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our outstanding contractual obligations as of March 31, 2024 from information and amounts previously disclosed as of December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, and Other Contingencies". Refer to Notes 5, Borrowings, and 9, Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees , of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of contractual obligations, commercial commitments, and other contingencies, including legal contingencies.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
-----------------------------------------------

See Note 1, Business, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been no material changes to the Company's exposure to market risks since what was disclosed in the Company's December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
------------------------------------------------

Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------------------------------

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
--------------------------

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
-------------------------

In the ordinary course of business, we may from time to time be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 9 Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees, to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading Legal included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for legal proceedings and related matters.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
---------------------

There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We included a detailed discussion of our risk factors in "Part I - Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our risk factors have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report 2024 Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. The risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition and/or future results.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Share Repurchase Authorization
------------------------------

On November 10, 2020, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Common Stock, including both Class A and Class D, which repurchases may be made, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market, in accordance with applicable securities laws (the "Share Repurchase Program"). The Share Repurchase Program was renewed on November 11, 2022 and will remain in effect for a two-year period. The Share Repurchase Program authorizes but does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time. The timing and extent to which the Company repurchases its shares will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, share price, liquidity targets, regulatory requirements and other factors. As of March 31, 2024 approximately $590.7 million remain available under the Share Repurchase Program. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

As of April 30, 2024, Rocket Companies repurchased 32.1 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.73. We have returned $409.3 million to shareholders in aggregate under the $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program.
