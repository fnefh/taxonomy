<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>Our condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and presented in U.S. dollars. They have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. In our opinion, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year or for any other future period.</p>
<h2>Management Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management is not aware of any factors that would significantly change its estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates, as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Subsequent Events</h2>
<p>In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. Refer to Note 5, Borrowings for disclosures on changes to the Company's debt agreements that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>Gain on sale of loans, net - includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including (1) net gain on sale of loans, which represents the premium we receive in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of loans into the secondary market, (2) loan origination fees (credits), points and certain costs, (3) provision for or benefit from investor reserves, (4) the change in fair value of interest rate locks and loans held for sale, (5) the gain or loss on forward commitments hedging loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and (6) the fair value of originated MSRs. An estimate of the Gain on sale of loans, net is recognized at the time an IRLC is issued, net of a pullthrough factor. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in current period earnings. When the mortgage loan is sold into the secondary market, any difference between the proceeds received and the current fair value of the loan is recognized in current period earnings in Gain on sale of loans, net. Included in Gain on sale of loans, net is the Fair value of originated MSRs, which represents the estimated fair value of MSRs related to loans which we have sold and retained the right to service.</p>
<p>Loan servicing (loss) income, net - includes income from servicing, sub-servicing and ancillary fees, and is recorded to income as earned, which is upon collection of payments from borrowers. This amount also includes the Change in fair value of MSRs, which is the adjustment for the fair value measurement of the MSR asset as of the respective balance sheet date. Refer to Note 3, Mortgage Servicing Rights for information related to the gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of MSRs.</p>
<p>Interest income, net - includes interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loans held for investment net of the interest expense paid on our loan funding facilities. Interest income is recorded as earned and interest expense is recorded as incurred. Interest income is accrued and credited to income daily based on the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") outstanding. The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due.</p>
<p>Other income - is derived primarily from deposit income, personal finance subscription revenue, closing fees, net appraisal revenue, net title insurance fees, personal loans business, real estate network referral fees and professional service fees.</p>
<p>The following significant revenue streams fall within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and are disaggregated hereunder. The remaining revenue streams within the scope of ASC 606 are immaterial, both individually and in aggregate.</p>
<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>Rocket Money subscription revenue - The Company recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract. We have determined that subscriptions represent a stand-ready obligation to perform over the subscription term. These performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Contracts are one month to one year in length. Subscription revenues were $65,950 and $46,448 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $192,119 and $128,627 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Amrock closing fees - The Company recognizes closing fees for non-recurring services provided in connection with the origination of the loan. These fees are recognized at the time of loan closing for purchase transactions or at the end of a client's three-day rescission period for refinance transactions, which represents the point in time the loan closing services performance obligation is satisfied. The consideration received for closing services is a fixed fee per loan that varies by state and loan type. Closing fees were $29,231 and $21,172 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $75,057 and $59,470 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Amrock appraisal revenue, net - The Company recognizes appraisal revenue when the appraisal service is completed. The Company may choose to deliver appraisal services directly to its client or subcontract such services to a third-party licensed and/or certified appraiser. In instances where the Company performs the appraisal, revenue is recognized as the gross amount of consideration received at a fixed price per appraisal. The Company is an agent in instances where a third-party appraiser is involved in the delivery of appraisal services and revenue is recognized net of third-party appraisal expenses. Appraisal revenue was $9,222 and $8,279 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $27,552 and $33,098 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Rocket Homes real estate network referral fees - The Company recognizes real estate network referral fee revenue based on arrangements with partner agencies contingent on the closing of a transaction. As this revenue stream is variable, and is contingent on the successful transaction close, the revenue is constrained until the occurrence of the transaction. At this point, the constraint on recognizing revenue is deemed to have been lifted and revenue is recognized for the consideration expected to be received. Real estate network referral fees were $14,363 and $16,841 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $40,657 and $37,588 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash</h2>
<p>The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain our bank accounts with a relatively small number of high-quality financial institutions.</p>
<p>Restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of cash on deposit for a repurchase facility, client application deposits, title premiums collected from the insured that are due to the underwriter, and principal and interest received in collection accounts for purchased assets.</p>

<h2>Loans subject to repurchase right from Ginnie Mae</h2>
<p>For certain loans sold to Ginnie Mae, the Company as the servicer has the unilateral right to repurchase any individual loan in a Ginnie Mae securitization pool if that loan meets defined criteria, including being delinquent more than 90 days. Once the Company has the unilateral right to repurchase the delinquent loan, the Company has effectively regained control over the loan and must re-recognize the loan on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and establish a corresponding liability regardless of the Company's intention to repurchase the loan. The asset and corresponding liability are recorded at the unpaid principal balance of the loan, which approximates its fair value.</p>

<h2>Recently Adopted Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01: Leases (Topic 842) - Common Control Arrangements. The new guidance requires all lessees in a lease with a lessor under common control to amortize leasehold improvements over the useful life of the common control group and provides new guidance for recognizing a transfer of assets between entities under common control as an adjustment to equity when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. There was no impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures upon adoption in January of 2024.</p>
<h2>Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures around significant segment expenses and the chief operating decision maker. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirements of the update, which is expected to result in expanded disclosures upon adoption.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures relating to the tax rate reconciliation and the income taxes paid information. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirements of the update, which is expected to result in expanded disclosures upon adoption.</p>
<h2>2. Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Fair value is the price that would be received if an asset were sold or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date. Required disclosures include classification of fair value measurements within a three-level hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3). Classification of a fair value measurement within the hierarchy is dependent on the classification and significance of the inputs used to determine the fair value measurement. Observable inputs are those that are observed, implied from, or corroborated with externally available market information. Unobservable inputs represent the Company's estimates of market participants' assumptions.</p>
<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>Fair value measurements are classified in the following manner:</p>
<p>Level 1 -Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Level 2 -Valuation is based on either observable prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, observable prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are derived directly from, or through correlation to, observable market data at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Level 3 -Valuation is based on the Company's internal models using assumptions at the measurement date that a market participant would use.</p>
<p>In determining fair value measurement, the Company uses observable inputs whenever possible. The level of a fair value measurement within the hierarchy is dependent on the lowest level of input that has a significant impact on the measurement as a whole. If quoted market prices are available at the measurement date or are available for similar instruments, such prices are used in the measurements. If observable market data is not available at the measurement date, judgment is required to measure fair value.</p>
<p>The following is a description of measurement techniques for items recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no material items recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Mortgage loans held for sale: Loans held for sale that trade in active secondary markets are valued using Level 2 measurements derived from observable market data, including market prices of securities backed by similar mortgage loans adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk. Loans held for sale for which there is little to no observable trading activity of similar instruments are valued using Level 3 measurements based upon dealer price quotes and internal models.</p>
<p>IRLCs: The fair value of IRLCs is based on current market prices of securities backed by similar mortgage loans (as determined above under mortgage loans held for sale), net of costs to close the loans, subject to the estimated loan funding probability, or "pull-through factor". Given the significant and unobservable nature of the pull-through factor, IRLCs are classified as Level 3.</p>
<p>MSRs: The fair value of MSRs is determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net future cash flows. The model includes estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, float earnings and contractual servicing fee income, among others. MSRs are classified as Level 3.</p>
<p>Forward commitments: The Company's forward commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.</p>
<p>Investment securities: Investment securities are trading debt securities that are recorded at fair value using observable market prices for similar securities or identical securities that are traded in less active markets, which are classified as Level 2 and include highly rated municipal, government and corporate bonds. As of March 31, 2023, the investment securities were classified as available for sale. The investments securities were subsequently transferred to the trading classification during 2023 due to the intent and frequency of purchases and sales.</p>
<p>Non-mortgage loans held for sale: Non-mortgage loans held for sale are personal loans, including solar loans. The fair value of non-mortgage loans is determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net future cash flows. Non-mortgage loans are classified as Level 3.</p>

<p>Assets and Liabilities of the consolidated CFE : Assets and liabilities represent non-mortgage loans and investment debt certificates at the consolidated CFE, respectively. The Company has elected the fair value option and to measure both the assets and liabilities of the consolidated CFE using the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities. The Company determined inputs to the fair value measurement of the financial assets to be more observable. The fair value of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated CFE are determined using an internal valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net future cash flows and are classified as Level 3. The net equity in the consolidated CFE represents the fair value of the Company's beneficial interest in the entity.</p>
<h2>Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis</h2>
<p>The table below shows a summary of financial statement items that are measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, including assets measured under the fair value option. There were no material transfers of assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>

The total UPB of mortgage loans serviced, excluding subserviced loans, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $512,980,084 and $468,237,971, respectively. The portfolio primarily consists of high-quality performing agency and government (FHA and VA) loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, delinquent loans (defined as 60-plus days past-due) were 1.40% and 1.23%, respectively, of our total portfolio. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold excess servicing cash flows on certain agency loans for total proceeds of $136,916 and $383,694, respectively.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the weighted average discount rate and prepayment speed assumptions used to determine the fair value of MSRs as well as the expected life of the loans in the servicing portfolio:</p>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of MSRs are prepayment speeds and the discount rate. Increases in prepayment speeds generally have an adverse effect on the value of MSRs as the underlying loans prepay faster. In a declining interest rate environment, the fair value of MSRs generally decreases as prepayments increase and therefore, the estimated life of the MSRs and related cash flows decrease. Decreases in prepayment speeds generally have a positive effect on the value of MSRs as the underlying loans prepay less frequently. In a rising interest rate environment, the fair value of MSRs generally increases as prepayments decrease and therefore, the estimated life of the MSRs and related cash flows increase. Increases in the discount rate result in a lower MSRs value and decreases in the discount rate result in a higher MSRs value. MSRs uncertainties are hypothetical and do not always have a direct correlation with each assumption. Changes in one assumption may result in changes to another assumption, which might magnify or counteract the uncertainties.</p>

<h2>Credit Risk</h2>
<p>The Company is subject to credit risk associated with mortgage loans that it purchases and originates during the period of time prior to the sale of these loans. The Company considers credit risk associated with these loans to be minimal as it holds the loans for a short period of time, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is generally less than 45 days from the date of borrowing, and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid. The Company is also subject to credit risk associated with mortgage loans it has repurchased as a result of breaches of representations and warranties during the period of time between repurchase and resale.</p>
<h2>5. Borrowings</h2>
<p>The Company maintains various funding facilities, financing facilities and unsecured senior notes, as shown in the tables below. Interest rates typically have two main components; a base rate - most commonly SOFR, which is sometimes subject to a minimum floor, plus a spread. Some funding facilities have a commitment fee, which can be up to 50 basis points per year. The commitment fee charged by lenders is calculated based on the committed line amount multiplied by a negotiated rate. The Company is required to maintain certain covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity, maximum total debt or liabilities to net worth ratio, pretax net income requirements and other customary debt covenants, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>The amount owed and outstanding on the Company's loan funding facilities fluctuates based on its origination volume, the amount of time it takes the Company to sell the loans it originates and the Company's ability to use its cash to self-fund loans. In addition to self-funding, the Company may use surplus cash to "buy-down" the effective interest rate of certain loan funding facilities or to self-fund a portion of our loan originations. Buy-down funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have the ability to withdraw these funds at any time, unless a margin call has been made or a default has occurred under the relevant facilities. We will also deploy cash to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which can be transferred to a mortgage loan funding facility or the early buy out line, provided that such loans meet the eligibility criteria to be placed on such lines. The remaining portion will be funded in normal course over a short period of time, generally less than 45 days.</p>
<p>The terms of the Senior Notes restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiary guarantors among other things to: (1) merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets and; (2) create liens on assets.</p>

<h2>6. Transactions with Related Parties</h2>
<p>The Company has entered into various transactions and agreements with RHI, its subsidiaries, certain other affiliates and related parties (collectively, "Related Parties"). These transactions include providing financing and services as well as obtaining financing and services from these Related Parties.</p>
<h2>Financing Arrangements</h2>
<p>On June 9, 2017, Rocket Mortgage and RHI entered into an unsecured line of credit, as further amended and restated on September 16, 2021 ("RHI Line of Credit"), pursuant to which Rocket Mortgage has a borrowing capacity of $2,000,000. The RHI Line of Credit matures on July 27, 2025. Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum of the applicable base rate, plus a spread of 1.25%. The line of credit is uncommitted and RHI has sole discretion over advances. The RHI Line of Credit also contains negative covenants which restrict the ability of the Company to incur debt and create liens on certain assets. It also requires Rocket Mortgage to maintain a quarterly consolidated net income before taxes if adjusted tangible net worth meets certain requirements. The Company did not draw on the RHI Line of Credit during the period and there wereno outstanding amounts due as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>RHI and RTI are parties to a surplus debenture, effective as of December 28, 2015, and as further amended and restated on July 31, 2023 (the "RHI/RTI Debenture"), pursuant to which RTI is indebted to RHI for an aggregate principal amount of $21,500. The RHI/RTI Debenture matures on December 31, 2030. Interest under the RHI/RTI Debenture accrues at an annual rate of 8%. Principal and interest under the RHI/RTI Debenture are due and payable quarterly, in each case subject to RTI achieving a certain amount of surplus and payments of all interest before principal payments begin. Any unpaid amounts of principal and interest shall be due and payable upon the maturity of the RHI/RTI Debenture. RTI repaid an aggregate of $ 429 and $250 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1,291 and $750 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total amount of interest accrued was $434 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $1,291 and $1,286 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate amount due to RHI was $30,264 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Holdings and RHI entered into an agreement for an uncommitted, unsecured revolving line of credit ("RHI 2nd Line of Credit"), which will provide for financing from RHI to the Company of up to $100,000. The RHI 2nd Line of Credit matures on July 31, 2025. Borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at a rate per annum of the applicable base rate plus a spread of 1.25%. The negative covenants of the line of credit restrict the ability of the Company to incur debt and create liens on certain assets. The line of credit also contains customary events of default. The Company did not draw on the RHI 2nd Line of Credit during the period and there were no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The Notes receivable and due from affiliates was $15,226 and $19,530 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Notes payable and due to affiliates was $30,511 and $31,006 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Services, Products and Other Transactions</h2>
<p>We have entered into transactions and agreements to provide certain services to Related Parties. We recognized revenue of $1,450 and $2,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $4,710 and $7,184 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the performance of these services, which was included in Other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We have also entered into transactions and agreements to purchase certain services, products and other transactions from Related Parties. We incurred expenses of $801 and $556, which are included in Salaries, commissions and team member benefits; $13,142 and $12,677, which are included in General and administrative expenses; and $2,813 and $2,637, which are included in Marketing and advertising expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We incurred expenses of $ 2,210 and $1,611, which are included in Salaries, commissions and team member benefits; $37,975 and $35,929, which are included in General and administrative expenses; and $8,115 and $9,341, which are included in Marketing and advertising expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).</p>

<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>The Company has also entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with RHI and our Chairman as described further in Note 7, Income Taxes. The Company has also guaranteed the debt of a related party as described further in Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.</p>
<h2>Lease Transactions with Related Parties</h2>
<p>The Company is a party to lease agreements for certain offices, including our headquarters in Detroit, with various affiliates of Bedrock Management Services LLC ("Bedrock"), a related party, and other related parties of the Company. The Company incurred expenses related to these arrangements of $ 18,550 and $18,934 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $56,848 and $55,620 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in General and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).</p>
<h2>7. Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company had an income tax benefit of $15,895 on Loss before income taxes of $497,319 and an income tax expense of $2,680 on Income before income taxes of $117,625 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had an income tax expense of $5,878 on Loss before income taxes of $6,907 and an income tax benefit of $2,606 on Loss before income taxes of $159,992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's income tax expense varies from the expense that would be expected based on statutory rates due principally to its organizational structure and valuation allowances for deferred tax benefits the Company does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.</p>
<p>Rocket Companies owns a portion of the units of Holdings, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes and in most applicable jurisdictions for state and local income tax purposes. The remaining portion of Holdings is owned by RHI and our Chairman ("LLC Members"). As a partnership, Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by Holdings is passed through and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including Rocket Companies, in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement of Holdings (the "Holdings Operating Agreement"). Rocket Companies is a C Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of Holdings.</p>
<p>Several subsidiaries of Holdings, such as Rocket Mortgage, Amrock and other subsidiaries, are single member LLC entities. As single member LLCs of Holdings, all taxable income or loss generated by these subsidiaries passes through and is included in the income or loss of Holdings. A pr ovision for state and local income taxes is required for certain jurisdictions that tax single member LLCs as regarded entities. O ther subsidiaries of Holdings, such as Rocket Title Insurance Company, LMB Mortgage Services and others, are treated as C Corporations and separately file and pay taxes apart from Holdings in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state, local and Canada.</p>
<h2>Tax Receivable Agreement</h2>
<p>The Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Holdings when Holdings Units are redeemed from or exchanged by the LLC Members. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of Holdings Units as direct purchases of Holdings Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.</p>
<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>The Company previously entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the "Tax Receivable Agreement") with the LLC Members that will obligate the Company to make payments to the LLC Members generally equal to 90% of the applicable cash tax savings that the Company actually realizes or in some cases is deemed to realize as a result of the tax attributes generated by (i) certain increases in our allocable share of the tax basis in Holdings' assets resulting from (a) the purchases of Holdings Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock) from the LLC Members (or their transferees of Holdings Units or other assignees) using the net proceeds from our initial public offering or in any future offering, (b) exchanges by the LLC Members (or their transferees of Holdings Units or other assignees) of Holdings Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock) for cash or shares of our Class B common stock or Class A common stock, as applicable, or (c) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement; (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) disproportionate allocations (if any) of tax benefits to Holdings as a result of section 704(c) of the Code that relate to the reorganization transactions. The Company will retain the benefit of the remaining 10% of these tax savings.</p>
<p>No payment was made to the LLC Members pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. A payment of $35,697 was made to the LLC Members pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of the taxable income of Rocket Companies in the future. Any such changes in these factors or changes in the Company's determination of the need for a valuation allowance related to the tax benefits acquired under the Tax Receivable Agreement could adjust the Tax receivable agreement liability recognized and recorded within earnings in future periods.</p>
<h2>Tax Distributions</h2>
<p>The holders of Holdings' Units, including Rocket Companies Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their share of any taxable income of Holdings. The Holdings Operating Agreement provides for pro rata cash distributions ("tax distributions") to the holders of the Holdings Units in an amount generally calculated to provide each holder of Holdings Units with sufficient cash to cover its tax liability in respect of the Holdings Units. In general, these tax distributions are computed based on Holdings' estimated taxable income, multiplied by an assumed tax rate as set forth in the Holdings Operating Agreement.</p>
<p>For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Holdings paid tax distributions totaling $30 and $14,222, respectively, to holders of Holdings Units other than Rocket Companies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Holdings paid no tax distributions to holders of Holdings Units other than Rocket Companies.</p>
<h2>8. Derivative Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The Company uses forward commitments to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on certain fixed and adjustable rate commitments. Utilization of forward commitments involves some degree of basis risk. Basis risk is defined as the risk that the hedging instrument's price does not offset the increase or decrease in the market price of the underlying financial instrument being hedged. The Company calculates an expected hedge ratio to mitigate a portion of this risk. The Company's derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedging instruments, and therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in current period Net (loss) income. Hedging gains and losses are included in Gain on sale of loans, net and Change in fair value of MSRs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).</p>

<p>Counterparty agreements for forward commitments contain master netting agreements.The table below presents the gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities subject to master netting agreements. Margin cash is cash that is exchanged by counterparties to be held as collateral related to these derivative financial instruments. Margin cash held on behalf of counterparties is recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, and the related liability is classified in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Margin cash pledged to counterparties is excluded from Cash and cash equivalents and instead recorded in Other assets as a margin call receivable from counterparties in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had $58,405 and $66,598 of margin cash pledged to counterparties related to these forward commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

<h2>Counterparty Credit Risk</h2>
<p>Credit risk is defined as the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract, which exceeds the value of existing collateral, if any. The Company attempts to limit its credit risk by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate.</p>
<h2>Rocket Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)</h2>
<p>($ in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts or Unless Otherwise Noted)</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of contractual nonperformance by its trading counterparties and counterparties to its various over-the-counter derivative financial instruments noted in the above Notional and Fair Value discussion. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and entering into netting agreements with the counterparties as appropriate.</p>
<p>Certain counterparties have master netting agreements. The master netting agreements contain a legal right to offset amounts due to and from the same counterparty. Derivative assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of loss positions with the same counterparty and, therefore, also represent the Company's maximum counterparty credit risk. The Company incurred no credit losses due to nonperformance of any of its counterparties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.</p>
<h2>9. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Lock Commitments</h2>
<p>IRLCs are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each client's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The number of days from the date of the IRLC to expiration of fixed and variable rate lock commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was40 days and 41 days, respectively, on average.</p>

The ultimate outcome of these or other proceedings, including any monetary awards against Rocket Companies or one or more of its subsidiaries, is uncertain and there can be no assurance as to the amount of any such potential awards. Rocket Companies and its subsidiaries will incur defense costs and other expenses in connection with these proceedings. Plus, if a judgment for money that exceeds specified thresholds is rendered against Rocket Companies or any of its subsidiaries and it or they fail to timely pay, discharge, bond or obtain a stay of execution of such judgment, it is possible that one or more of the companies could be deemed in default of loan funding facilities and other agreements governing indebtedness. If the final resolution in one or more of these proceedings is unfavorable, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of Rocket Companies.</p>

<h2>11. Segments</h2>
<p>The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as its Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), has evaluated how the Company views and measures its performance. ASC 280, Segment Reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in that guidance, the Company has determined that it has two reportable segments - Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the Company's internal operations and the nature of its marketing channels, which drive client acquisition into the mortgage platform. This determination reflects how the CODM monitors performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions.</p>
<h2>Direct to Consumer</h2>
<p>In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with Rocket Mortgage online and/or with the Company's mortgage bankers. The Company markets to potential clients in this segment through various brand campaigns and performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. The segment also includes title insurance, appraisals and settlement services complementing the Company's end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment and are viewed as an extension of the client experience. Servicing enables Rocket Mortgage to establish and maintain long term relationships with our clients, through multiple touchpoints at regular engagement intervals.</p>
<p>Revenues in the Direct to Consumer segment are generated primarily from the gain on sale of loans, which includes loan origination fees, revenues associated with title insurance, appraisals and settlement services and revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market, as well as the fair value of originated MSRs and hedging gains and losses. Loan servicing income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing loans and other ancillary servicing fees, as well as changes in the fair value of MSRs due to changes in valuation assumptions and realization of cash flows.</p>

<h2>Partner Network</h2>
<p>The Rocket Professional platform supports our Partner Network segment, where we leverage our superior client service and widely recognized brand to grow marketing and influencer relationships, and our mortgage broker partnerships through Rocket Pro TPO ("third party origination"). Our marketing partnerships consist of well-known consumer-focused companies that find value in our award-winning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient mortgage process, where mortgages may not be their primary offering. We also enable clients to start the mortgage process through the Rocket platform in the way that works best for them, including through a local mortgage broker.</p>
<p>Revenues in the Partner Network segment are generated primarily from the gain on sale of loans, which includes loan origination fees, revenues associated with title insurance, appraisals and settlement services and revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market, as well as the fair value of originated MSRs and hedging gains and losses.</p>
<h2>Other Information About Our Segments</h2>
<p>The Company measures the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. The accounting policies applied by our segments are described in Note 1, Business, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies . Directly attributable expenses include Salaries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses and Other expenses, such as servicing costs and origination costs.</p>
<p>The Company does not allocate assets to its reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is managed on a consolidated basis and is not used in the context of segment reporting.</p>
<p>The Company also reports an "All Other" category that includes operations from Rocket Money, Rocket Loans, Rocket Homes and includes professional service fee revenues from related parties. These operations are neither significant individually nor in aggregate and therefore do not constitute a reportable segment.</p>

<p>The non-controlling interest holders have the right to exchange Holdings Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class D common stock or Class C common stock (together referred to as "Paired Interests"), for, at our option, (i) shares of our Class B common stock or Class A common stock or (ii) cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of our Class A common stock). As such, future exchanges of Paired Interests by non-controlling interest holders will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in-capital when Holdings has positive or negative net assets, respectively. During the periods presented, neither our Chairman nor RHI has exchanged any Paired Interests.</p>
<h2>13. Share-based Compensation</h2>
<p>Restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance stock units ("PSUs") and stock options are granted to team members and directors of the Company and its affiliates under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, with forfeitures recognized as they occur.</p>
<p>The Company granted approximately 1,100,000 and 13,500,000 RSUs with an estimated future expense of $22,500 and $180,300 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These awards generally vest semi-annually over a three-year period, subject to the grantee's employment or service with the Company through each applicable vesting date.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Company authorized approximately 1,100,000 PSUs at target during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that will vest based on the satisfaction of certain market, performance and service conditions. A portion of the PSUs will cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on the satisfaction of certain market and service conditions. The fair value of the award is determined based on a Monte Carlo valuation model. The remaining portion of the PSUs will cliff vest at the end of a three-year period based on the satisfaction of certain performance and service conditions, which will be established by the Company at a future date. The Company has determined that the service inception date precedes the grant date and the fair value of these awards will be remeasured quarterly based on the current period share price until the awards are granted. This portion of the PSUs is not considered contingently issuable and is excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company has an employee stock purchase plan, referred to as the Team Member Stock Purchase Plan ("TMSPP"), under which eligible team members may direct the Company to withhold up to 15% of their gross pay to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to85% of the closing market price on the exercise date. The TMSPP is a liability classified compensatory plan and the Company recognizes compensation expense over the offering period based on the fair value of the purchase discount. The number of shares purchased by team members through the TMSPP were 434,822 and 802,759, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and1,685,807 and 2,475,858 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries have individual compensation plans that include equity awards and stock appreciation rights.</p>

<h2>14. Earnings Per Share</h2>
<p>The Company applies the two-class method for calculating and presenting earnings per share by separately presenting earnings per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In applying the two-class method, the Company allocates undistributed earnings equally on a per share basis between Class A and Class B common stock. According to the Company's certificate of incorporation, the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to participate in earnings equally on a per-share basis, as if all shares of common stock were of a single class, and in dividends as may be declared by the board of directors. Holders of the Class A and Class B common stock also have equal priority in liquidation. Shares of Class C and Class D common stock do not participate in earnings of Rocket Companies, Inc. As a result, the shares of Class C and Class D common stock are not considered participating securities and are not included in the weighted-average shares outstanding for purposes of earnings per share. RSUs and PSUs awarded as part of the Company's compensation program are included in the weighted-average Class A shares outstanding in the calculation of basic earnings per share once the units are fully vested.</p>
<p>Basic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing Net (loss) income attributable to Rocket Companies by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing Net (loss) income attributable to Rocket Companies by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. There was no Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or 2023. See Note 12, Non-controlling Interest for a description of Paired Interests and their potential impact on Class A and Class B share ownership.</p>
<p>Diluted earnings per share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from share-based awards and Class D common stock. The treasury stock method is used to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards, which assumes the proceeds upon vesting or exercise of awards would be used to purchase common stock at the average price for the period. The if-converted method is used to calculate the dilutive effect of converting Class D common stock to Class A common stock.</p>

After evaluating the potential dilutive effect under the if-converted method, the outstanding Holdings Units for the assumed exchange of non-controlling interests were determined to be anti-dilutive and thus were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Holding Units were dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and therefore included in the earnings per share calculation.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<p>The following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Form 10-Q") and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," and in Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in our Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</h2>
<p>This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "target," "will," "would" and, in each case, their negative or other various or comparable terminology. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth are forward-looking statements. As you read this Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described under the heading "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors, including those described under the heading "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q, could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Our forward-looking statements made herein are made only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We expressly disclaim any intent, obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this Form 10-Q.</p>

<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h2>Business Trends</h2>
<p>From January to September 2024, the U.S. inflation rate declined from 3.1% to 2.4%, progressing toward the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. In mid-September, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5.00%. Subsequent to quarter end, in November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by an additional 25 basis points to 4.75%. Mortgage interest rates declined during the quarter, providing some relief to home affordability, however, rate volatility, constrained housing inventory, rising home prices and economic uncertainty persist, impacting both refinance and purchase origination activity across the industry.</p>
<h2>Three months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>We originated $28.5 billion in residential mortgage loans, an increase of $6.3 billion, or 28%, compared to $22.2 billion for the same period in 2023. Our Net loss for the period was $481.4 million, a decrease of $596.4 million, compared to Net income of $114.9 million for the same period in 2023. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $285.9 million, an increase of $212.7 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $73.2 million for the same period in 2023. For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.</p>
<h2>Nine months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>We originated $73.4 billion in residential mortgage loans, an increase of $11.9 billion, or 19%, compared to $61.5 billion for the same period in 2023. Our Net loss for the period was $12.8 million, an increase of $144.6 million, compared to Net loss of $157.4 million for the same period in 2023. We generated $685.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA, an increase of $672.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $12.5 million for the same period in 2023. For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively "our non-GAAP financial measures") as non-GAAP measures which management believes provide useful information to investors. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income (loss), or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define our non-GAAP financial measures differently, and as a result, our measures of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on these measures for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, these measures allow management to compare our results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.</p>
<p>We define "Adjusted revenue" as total revenues net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges. We define "Adjusted net income (loss)" as tax-effected net income (loss) before share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, career transition program and the tax effects of those adjustments as applicable. We define "Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share" as Adjusted net income (loss) divided by the adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding which includes diluted weighted average Class A common stock and the assumed pro forma exchange and conversion of Class D common stock outstanding for the applicable period presented. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income (loss) before interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges and career transition program.</p>
<p>We exclude from each of our non-GAAP financial measures the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, as this represents a non-cash non-realized adjustment to our total revenues, reflecting changes in assumptions including discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in market interest rates, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operation. We also exclude effects of contractual prepayment protection associated with sales of MSRs. Adjusted EBITDA includes Interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of Interest income, net, as these expenses are a direct cost driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<p>Our definitions of each of our non-GAAP financial measures allow us to add back certain cash and non-cash charges, and deduct certain gains that are included in calculating Total revenue, net, Net (loss) income attributable to Rocket Companies or Net (loss) income. However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. From time to time in the future, we may include or exclude other items if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors.</p>
<p>Although we use our non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.</p>
<p>Limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures included, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;</li>
<li>(b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt;</li>
<li>(c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and</li>
<li>(d) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>We compensate for these limitations by using our non-GAAP financial measures along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. See below for reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Additionally, our U.S. GAAP-based measures can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.</p>

<h2>Key Performance Indicators</h2>
<p>We monitor a number of key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of our business operations. Our loan production key performance indicators enable us to monitor our ability to generate gain on sale revenue as well as understand how our performance compares to the total mortgage origination market. Our servicing portfolio key performance indicators enable us to monitor the overall size of our servicing portfolio of business, the related value of our mortgage servicing rights, and the health of the business as measured by the average MSR delinquency rate. Other key performance indicators for other Rocket Companies, besides Rocket Mortgage ("Oth er Rocket Companies" ), allow us to monitor both revenues and unit sales generated by these businesses. We include Rocket Money paid subscriptions, as we believe the metric is a key indicator of growth and revenue. We also include Rockethomes.com average unique monthly visits, as we believe traffic on the site is an indicator of consumer interest.</p>

<h2>Description of Certain Components of Financial Data</h2>
<h2>Components of Revenue</h2>
<p>Our sources of revenue include Gain on sale of loans, net, Loan servicing (loss) income, net, Interest income, net and Other income.</p>
<h2>Gain on sale of loans, net</h2>
<p>Gain on sale of loans, net includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including (1) net gain on sale of loans, which represents the premium we receive in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of loans into the secondary market, (2) loan origination fees, credits, points and certain costs, (3) provision for or benefit from investor reserves, (4) the change in fair value of interest rate locks ("IRLCs" or "rate lock") and loans held for sale, (5) the gain or loss on forward commitments hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs and (6) the fair value of originated MSRs. MS R assets are created at the time mortgage loans held for sale are securitized and sold to investors for cash, while the Company retains the right to service the loan.</p>
<h2>Loan servicing (loss) income, net</h2>
<p>Loan servicing fee income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing the loans and includes ancillary revenue such as late fees and modification incentives. Loan servicing fee income is recorded to income as earned, which is upon collection of payments from borrowers. We have elected to measure the MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes in fair value of MSRs, net primarily due to the realization of expected cash flows and/or changes in valuation inputs and estimates, are recognized in current period earnings.</p>
<h2>Interest income, net</h2>
<p>Interest income, net is interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale net of the interest expense paid on our loan funding facilities.</p>
<h2>Other income</h2>
<p>Other income i ncludes revenues generated from R ocket Money (personal finance subscription revenue), Amrock (closing fees and appraisal fees), Rocket Loans (personal loans), Rocket Homes (real estate network referral fe es), Deposit income related to revenue earned on deposits, including escrow deposits an d professional service fees. The professional service fees represent amounts received in exchange for professional services provided to affiliated companies. Services are provided primarily in connection with technology, facilities, human resources, accounting, training and security functions. Other income also includes revenues from additional entities and other miscellaneous income.</p>
<h2>Components of operating expenses</h2>
<p>Our operating expenses as presented in the statement of operations data includeSala ries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses, Marketing and advertising expenses, Interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt and Other expenses.</p>
<h2>Salaries, commissions and team member benefits</h2>
<p>Salaries, commissions and team member benefits include all payroll, benefits and share-based compensation expenses for our team members.</p>
<h2>General and administrative expenses</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy costs, professional services, loan processing expenses on loans that do not close or that are not charged to clients on closed loans, commitment fees, fees on loan funding facilities, license fees, office expenses and other operating expenses.</p>
<h2>Marketing and advertising expenses</h2>
<p>Marketing and advertising expenses a re primarily related to performance and brand marketing.</p>
<h2>Interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt</h2>
<p>Interest and amortization expense related to our Senior Notes.</p>
<h2>Other expenses</h2>
<p>Other expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization on property and equipment, mortgage servicing related expenses and expenses generated from Amrock (title insurance services, property valuation and settlement services).</p>
<h2>Income taxes</h2>
<p>In calculating the provision for interim income taxes, in accordance with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. At the end of each interim period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. Tax-effects of significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur.</p>
<h2>Tax Receivable Agreement</h2>
<p>Refer to Note 7 , Income Taxes for more information on Tax Receivable Agreement.</p>
<h2>Share-based compensation</h2>
<p>Share-based compensation is comprised of both equity and liability awards and is measured and expensed accordingly under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718 Compensation Stock Compensation . As indicated above, share-based compensation expense is included as part of salaries, benefits and team member benefits.</p>
<h2>Non-controlling interest</h2>
<p>We are the sole managing member of Holdings and consolidate the financial results of Holdings. Therefore, we report a non-controlling interest based on the Holdings Units of Holdings held by Dan Gilbert, our founder and Chairman (our "Chairman") and RHI on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income or loss is attributed to the non-controlling interests based on the weighted average Holdings Units outstanding during the period and is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Refer to Note 12, Non-controlling Interest for more information on non-controlling interests.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Gain on sale of loans, net table</h2>
<p>At the time an IRLC is issued, an estimate of the Gain on sale of loans, net is recognized in the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the table above. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in this same component as the loan progresses through closing, which is the moment that loans move from an IRLC to a loan held for sale, and ultimately through the sale of the loan. We deploy a hedge strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes from the point of the IRLC through the sale of the loan. The changes to the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs in each period is dependent on several factors, including mortgage origination volume, how long a loan remains at a given stage in the origination process and the movement of interest rates during that period as compared to the immediately preceding period. Loans originated during an increasing rate environment generally decrease in value, and loans originated during a decreasing rate environment generally increase in value. When the mortgage loan is sold into the secondary market, any difference between the proceeds received and the current fair value of the loan is recognized and moves from the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the Net gain on sale of loans component in the table above. The Revaluation gain from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs component reflects the forward hedge commitments intended to offset the various fair value adjustments that impact the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs and the Net gain on sale of loans components. As a result, these three components should be evaluated in combination when evaluating Gain on sale of loans, net, as the sum of these components are primarily driven by net rate lock volume. Furthermore, at the point of sale of the loan, the Fair value of originated MSRs and the Provision for investor reserves are recognized each in their respective components shown above.</p>
<h2>Three months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>Gain on sale of loans, net was $844.4 million, an increase of $272.3 million, or 48%, compared to $572.1 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 43% increase in net rate lock volume, impacting Net gain on sale of loans, Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs, and Revaluation from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs.</p>
<p>The Fair value of originated MSRs was $337.7 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 2%, when compared to $330.6 million for the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in sold loan volume, offset by a lower MSR fair value multiple during the period.</p>
<p>The Provision for investor reserves expense was flat period over period.</p>
<h2>Nine months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>Gain on sale of loans, net was $2.3 billion, an increase of $666.0 million, or 41%, compared to $1.6 billion for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 23% increase in net rate lock volume and 13% higher gain on sale margin, impacting Net gain on sale of loans, Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs, and Revaluation from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs.</p>
<p>The Fair value of originated MSRs was $906.0 million, an increase of $56.0 million, or 7%, when compared to $850.0 million for the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in sold loan volume, offset by a lower MSR fair value multiple during the period.</p>
<p>The Investor reserves liability balance was relatively flat in the current and prior period. The $73.7 million reduction in provision expense was primarily due to a decrease in losses on repurchased loans in the current period, compared to the same period in 2023.</p>

<h2>Three months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>Total expenses during the period were $1.1 billion, an increase of $58.7 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2023. General and administrative expenses were $221.1 million, an increase of $21.7 million, or 11%, compared to $199.4 million for the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in variable costs associated with higher origination volume and increased third-party credit report costs per unit, partially offset by other loan processing and vendor cost efficiencies. Salaries, commissions and team member benefits were $607.5 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 3%, compared to $589.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase, excluding 2023 non-recurring Career transition program expense of $51.5 million, was driven by increased variable compensation associated with the higher origination volume during the current period.</p>
<h2>Nine months ended September 30, 2024 summary</h2>
<p>Total expenses during the period were $3.3 billion, an increase of $72.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $690.7 million, an increase of $95.5 million, or 16%, compared to $595.2 million for the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in variable costs associated with higher origination volume and increased third-party credit report costs per unit, partially offset by other loan processing and vendor cost efficiencies.</p>
<h2>Summary Results by Segment for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023</h2>
<p>Our operations are organized by distinct marketing channels which promote client acquisition and are categorized under two reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with the Rocket Mortgage app and/or with our mortgage bankers, consisting of sales team members across our platform. We market to potential clients in this segment through various performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. This also includes providing title insurance services, appraisals and settlement services to these clients as part of our end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment as they are viewed as an extension of the client experience with the primary objective to establish and maintain positive, regular touchpoints with our clients, which positions us to have high retention and recapture the clients' next refinance, purchase and personal loan transactions. These activities position us to be the natural choice for clients' next refinance or purchase transaction.</p>
<p>The Rocket Professional platform supports our Partner Network segment, where we leverage our superior client service and widely recognized brand to grow marketing and influencer relationships, and our mortgage broker partnerships through Rocket Pro TPO. Our marketing partnerships consist of well-known consumer-focused companies that find value in our awardwinning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient mortgage process, where mortgages may not be their primary offering. We also enable clients to start the mortgage process through the Rocket platform in the way that works best for them, including through a local mortgage broker. Rocket Pro TPO works exclusively with mortgage brokers, community banks and credit unions. Rocket Pro TPO's partners provide the face-to-face service their clients desire, while tapping into the expertise, technology and award-winning process of Rocket Mortgage.</p>
<p>We measure the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. Contribution margin is intended to measure the direct profitability of each segment and is calculated as Adjusted revenue less directly attributable expenses. Adjusted revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure described above. Directly attributable expenses include Salaries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses, Marketing and advertising expenses and Other expenses, such as direct servicing costs and origination costs. For segments, we measure gain on sale margin of sold loans and refer to this metric as 'sold loan gain on sale margin'. A loan is considered sold when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. Sold loan gain on sale margin reflects the gain on sale revenue of loans sold into the secondary market divided by the sold loan volume for the period. By contrast, 'gain on sale margin', which we reference outside of the segment discussion, measures the gain on sale revenue, net divided by net rate lock volume for the period. See below for our overview and discussion of segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For additional discussion, see Note 11, Segments of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q.</p>

<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>· cash flow from our operations, including:</li>
<li>· sale of whole loans into the secondary market;</li>
<li>· sale of mortgage servicing rights and excess servicing cash flows into the secondary market;</li>
<li>· loan origination fees;</li>
<li>· servicing fee income;</li>
<li>· interest income on loans held for sale; and</li>
<li>· other income</li>
<li>· borrowings, including under our funding facilities; financing facilities; unsecured senior notes; and</li>
<li>· cash and marketable securities on hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, our primary uses of funds have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>· origination of loans;</li>
<li>· interest expense;</li>
<li>· repayment of debt;</li>
<li>· operating expenses;</li>
<li>· acquisition of mortgage servicing rights; and</li>
<li>· distributions to RHI including those to fund distributions for payment of taxes by RHI shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also subject to contingencies which may have a significant impact on the use of our cash.</p>
<p>In order to originate and aggregate loans for sale into the secondary market, we use our own working capital and borrow or obtain money on a short-term basis primarily through committed and uncommitted funding facilities, generally established with large global banks.</p>
<p>Our funding facilities are primarily in the form of master repurchase agreements. We also have funding facilities directly with the GSEs. Loans financed under these facilities are generally financed at approximately 97% to 98% of the principal balance of the loan (although certain types of loans are financed at lower percentages of the principal balance of the loan), which requires us to fund the balance from cash generated from operations. Once closed, the underlying residential mortgage loan that is held for sale is pledged as collateral for the borrowing or advance that was made under these funding facilities. In most cases, the loans will remain in one of the funding facilities for only a short time, generally less than 45 days, until the loans are pooled and sold. During the time the loans are held for sale, we earn interest income from the borrower on the underlying mortgage loan. This income is partially offset by the interest and fees we have to pay under the funding facilities.</p>
<p>When we sell a pool of loans in the secondary market, the proceeds received from the sale of the loans are used to pay back the amounts we owe on the funding facilities. We rely on the cash generated from the sale of loans to fund future loans and repay borrowings under our funding facilities. Delays or failures to sell loans in the secondary market could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position.</p>
<p>As discussed in Note 5, Borrowings , of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, we had 16 different funding and financing facilities in different amounts and with various maturities together with the Senior Notes. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate available amount under our facilities was $21.5 billion, with combined outstanding balances of $8.6 billion and unutilized capacity of $12.9 billion.</p>
<p>The amount of financing actually advanced on each individual loan under our funding facilities, as determined by agreed upon advance rates, may be less than the stated advance rate depending, in part, on the market value of the mortgage loans securing the financings. Each of our funding facilities allows the bank providing the funds to evaluate the market value of the loans that are serving as collateral for the borrowings or advances being made. If the bank determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, the bank can require us to provide additional collateral or reduce the amount outstanding with respect to those loans (e.g., initiate a margin call). Our inability or unwillingness to satisfy the request could result in the termination of the facilities and possible default under our other funding facilities. In addition, a large unanticipated margin call could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.</p>
<p>The amount owed and outstanding on our funding facilities fluctuates significantly based on our origination volume, the amount of time it takes us to sell the loans we originate and the amount of loans being self-funded with cash. We may from time to time use surplus cash to "buy-down" the effective interest rate of certain funding facilities or to self-fund a portion of our loan originations. Buy-down funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have the ability to withdraw these funds at any time, unless a margin call has been made or a default has occurred under the relevant facilities. We will also deploy cash to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which can be transferred to a warehouse line or the early buy out line, provided that such loans meet the eligibility criteria to be placed on such lines.</p>
<p>We remain in a strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of $8.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, which includes $1.2 billion of Cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which could be transferred to funding facilities (warehouse lines) at our discretion, $3.3 billion of undrawn lines of credit from financing facilities, and $2.0 billion of undrawn MSR lines. Margin cash held on behalf of counterparties is recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, and the related liability is classified in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Margin cash pledged to counterparties is excluded from Cash and cash equivalents and instead recorded in Other assets, as a receivable, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p>Our funding facilities, early buy out facilities, MSRs facilities and unsecured lines of credit also generally require us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and the availability of funds under these facilities is subject to, among other conditions, our continued compliance with these covenants. These financial covenants include, but are not limited to, maintaining (1) a certain minimum tangible net worth, (2) minimum liquidity, (3) a maximum ratio of total liabilities or total debt to tangible net worth and (4) pre-tax net income requirements. A breach of these covenants can result in an event of default under these facilities and as such allows the lenders to pursue certain remedies. In addition, each of these facilities, as well as our unsecured lines of credit, includes cross default or cross acceleration provisions that could result in all facilities terminating if an event of default or acceleration of maturity occurs under any facility. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023</h2>
<h2>Cash Flows</h2>
<p>Our Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash were $1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $256.7 million, or 26%, compared to $991.9 million at September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by less corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, partially offset by the increase in MSR purchases during the period.</p>
<h2>Equity</h2>
<p>Equity was $8.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $154.0 million, or 2%, compared to $8.5 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of net loss of $245.5 million, partially offset by share-based compensation expense of $141.2 million.</p>
<h2>Distributions</h2>
<p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material dividend or tax distributions. Except for tax distributions, these distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors.</p>
<h2>Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies</h2>
<p>There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our outstanding contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 from information and amounts previously disclosed as of December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies". Refer to Notes 5, Borrowings and 9, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees , of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of contractual obligations, commercial commitments and other contingencies, including legal contingencies.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective</h2>

<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes to the Company's exposure to market risks since what was disclosed in the Company's December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.</p>
<h2>PART II. OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, matters pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 9 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading Legal included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for legal proceedings and related matters.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We included a detailed discussion of our risk factors in "Part I - Item 1A. - Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our risk factors have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report 2024 Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. The risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition and/or future results.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds</h2>
<h2>Share Repurchase Authorization</h2>
<p>On November 10, 2020, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Common Stock, including both Class A and Class D, which authorized repurchases, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market, in accordance with applicable securities laws (the "Share Repurchase Program"). The Share Repurchase Program was renewed on November 11, 2022 and expired on November 11, 2024. During the Share Repurchase Program period, Rocket Companies repurchased 32.1 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.73. There were no share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>We returned $409.3 million to shareholders in aggregate under the $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program. At the time of its expiration, approximately $590.7 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program.</p>
<h2>Item 5. Other Information</h2>
<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024,no director or "officer" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company informed the Company of the adoption, modification or termination of a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or a "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.</p>
