    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >
          What are Bloom Energy's key products and their technological
          advantages?
        answer: >
          Bloom Energy's main products are the Energy Server and the Electrolyzer,
          both built on their proprietary solid oxide platform. The Energy
          Server converts fuel (natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen) into
          electricity through a non-combustion electrochemical process, offering
          higher efficiency than traditional power generation. The Bloom
          Electrolyzer produces hydrogen more efficiently than lower-temperature
          alternatives, requiring less electricity due to its high-temperature
          operation at 700-900 degrees Celsius.

          gigawatts per year production capacity. The company has 325 active
          patents in the U.S. and 145 internationally, with a research team
          including 57 PhDs. In 2023, they consolidated operations to improve
          efficiency and opened a multi-gigawatt manufacturing facility in
