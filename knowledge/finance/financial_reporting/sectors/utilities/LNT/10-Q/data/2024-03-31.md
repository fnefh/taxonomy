COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1(a) General The interim unaudited Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the 2023 Form 10-K .

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which unless otherwise noted are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. Results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

A change in management's estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurred. Certain prior period amounts in the Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for comparative purposes.

Derivatives Refer to Note 10 for discussion of changes in Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's derivative liabilities/assets during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets.

Regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items (in millions):

|  | Alliant Energy | Alliant Energy | IPL | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |

|  | $1,136 | $1,130 | $648 | $644 | $488 | $486 |

NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
-------------------------------------

WPL currently expects construction costs associated with its approximately1,100 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately $180 million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW's order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW's retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of March 31, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.

NOTE 4. RECEIVABLES
-------------------

Sales of Accounts Receivable IPL maintains a Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (Receivables Agreement) whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. In March 2024, IPL amended and extended through March 2026 the purchase commitment from the third party to which it sells its receivables. The transfers of receivables meet the criteria for sale accounting established by the transfer of financial assets accounting rules. As of March 31, 2024, IPL had $92 million of available capacity under its sales of accounts receivable program. IPL's maximum and average outstanding aggregate cash proceeds (based on daily outstanding balances) related to the sales of accounts receivable program for the three months ended March 31 were as follows (in millions):

| Deferred proceeds | 197 | 228 |

| Fair value of deferred proceeds | $184 | $216 |

As of March 31, 2024, outstanding receivables past due under the Receivables Agreement were $22 million. Additional attributes of IPL's receivables sold under the Receivables Agreement for the three months ended March 31 were as follows (in millions):

NOTE 7(b) Long-term Debt In March 2024, AEF entered into a $300 million variable rate (6% as of March 31, 2024) term loan credit agreement (with Alliant Energy as guarantor), which expires in March 2025. This term loan credit agreement amends and restates the term loan credit agreement that expired in March 2024, and retired the $300 million variable rate term loan set forth therein. AEF's restated term loan credit agreement includes an option to increase the amount outstanding with one or more additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million. In March 2024, WPL issued $300 million of 5.375% debentures due 2034. WPL's debentures were issued as green bonds, and an amount equal to or in excess of the net proceeds will be allocated or disbursed for the development and acquisition of WPL's solar EGUs.

Convertible Senior Notes As of March 31, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of Alliant Energy's convertible senior notes due 2026 (the Notes) to convert their Notes were not met, and as a result, the Notes were classified as "Long-term debt, net" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the net carrying amount of the Notes was $569 million, with unamortized debt issuance costs of $6 million, and the estimated fair value (Level 2) of the Notes was $567 million. As of March 31, 2024, there were no shares of Alliant Energy's common stock related to the potential conversion of the Notes included in diluted EPS based on Alliant Energy's average stock prices and the relevant terms of the Notes.

NOTE 10(b) Equity-based Compensation Plans A summary of compensation expense, including amounts allocated to IPL and WPL, and the related income tax benefits recognized for share-based compensation awards for the three months ended March 31 was as follows (in millions):

|  | Alliant Energy | Alliant Energy | IPL | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Compensation expense | $4 | $3 | $2 | $2 | $2 | $1 |
| Income tax benefits | 1 | 1 | 1 | - | - | - |

As of March 31, 2024, Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $22 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between1 year and 2 years.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, performance shares and restricted stock units were granted to key employees under the equity-based compensation plans as follows. These shares and units will be paid out in shares of common stock, and are therefore accounted for as equity awards.

Table of Contents

|  | Grants | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance shares (total shareowner return metric) | 123,098 | $46.04 |
| Performance shares (net income and diversity metrics) (formerly granted as performance restricted stock units) | 140,683 | 48.40 |
| Restricted stock units | 120,557 | 48.40 |

As of March 31, 2024, 242,680 shares were included in the calculation of diluted EPS related to the nonvested equity awards.

NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
-------------------------------

Commodity Derivatives -
-----------------------

Notional Amounts As of March 31, 2024, gross notional amounts and settlement/delivery years related to outstanding swap contracts, option contracts, physical forward contracts and FTRs that were accounted for as commodity derivative instruments were as follows (units in thousands):

|  | Electricity | Electricity | FTRs | FTRs | Natural Gas | Natural Gas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | MWhs | Years | MWhs | Years | Dths | Years |
| Alliant Energy | 1,412 | 2024-2026 | 4,162 | 2024 | 173,746 | 2024-2032 |
| IPL | 673 | 2024-2026 | 1,444 | 2024 | 78,790 | 2024-2030 |
| WPL | 739 | 2024-2026 | 2,718 | 2024 | 94,956 | 2024-2032 |

Financial Statement Presentation Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value each reporting date on the balance sheets as assets or liabilities as follows (in millions):

|  | Alliant Energy | Alliant Energy | IPL | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| Current derivative assets | $16 | $44 | $12 | $30 | $4 | $14 |
| Non-current derivative assets | 40 | 44 | 22 | 24 | 18 | 20 |
| Current derivative liabilities | 49 | 51 | 23 | 22 | 26 | 29 |
| Non-current derivative liabilities | 45 | 47 | 7 | 8 | 38 | 39 |

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's derivative assets decreased primarily due to settlements of FTRs, natural gas and electricity contracts, and lower natural gas prices. Based on IPL's and WPL's cost recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets.

Credit Risk-related Contingent Features Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, derivative assets and derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts would have been presented on the balance sheets as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents

|  | Alliant Energy | Alliant Energy | IPL | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Gross (as reported) | Net | Gross (as reported) | Net | Gross (as reported) | Net |
| March 31, 2024 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Derivative assets | $56 | $26 | $34 | $17 | $22 | $9 |
| Derivative liabilities | 94 | 64 | 30 | 13 | 64 | 51 |
| December 31, 2023 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Derivative assets | 88 | 47 | 54 | 32 | 34 | 15 |
| Derivative liabilities | 98 | 57 | 30 | 8 | 68 | 49 |

Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement.

Interest Rate Derivative The interest rate derivative associated with AEF's interest rate swap maturing in January 2026 was valued based on quoted prices that utilize current market interest rate forecasts. As of March 31, 2024, $ 3 million of non-current interest rate derivative assets was recorded in "Deferred charges and other" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. This interest rate derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge, with changes in fair value recorded as other comprehensive income/loss. As of March 31, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive income included $2 million of income related to the interest rate swap. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2 023 , $1 million and $1 million , respectively, of reductions to interest expense were recorded in Alliant Energy's income statement related to the interest rate swap.

NOTE 13(c) Guarantees and Indemnifications -
--------------------------------------------

Whiting Petroleum Whiting Petroleum is an independent oil and gas company. In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. Based on information made available to Alliant Energy by Whiting Petroleum, the Whiting Petroleum affiliate holds an approximate 6% share in the partnerships, and currently known obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. The general partnerships were formed under California law, and Alliant Energy Resources, LLC may need to perform under the guarantees if the affiliate of Whiting Petroleum is unable to meet its partnership obligations.

As of March 31, 2024, the currently known partnership obligations for the abandonment obligations are estimated at $ 49 million, which represents Alliant Energy's currently estimated maximum exposure under the guarantees. Alliant Energy estimates its expected loss to be a portion of the $49 million of known partnership abandonment obligations of the Whiting Petroleum affiliate and the other partners. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to these guarantees that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Whiting Petroleum completed a business combination with Oasis Petroleum Inc. in 2022. The combined operations are now known as Chord Energy Corporation. The business combination is not expected to affect the scope of the Whiting Petroleum affiliate's obligations to Alliant Energy or Alliant Energy's related guarantees.

Non-utility Wind Farm in OklahomaIn 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF acquired a cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm located in Oklahoma. The wind farm provides electricity to a third party under a long-term PPA. Alliant Energy provided a parent guarantee of its subsidiary's indemnification obligations under the related operating agreement and PPA. Alliant Energy's obligations under the operating agreement were $51 million as of March 31, 2024 and will reduce annually until expiring in July 2047. Alliant Energy's obligations under the PPA are subject to a maximum limit of $17 million and expire in December 2031, subject to potential extension. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to this guarantee that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Transfers of Renewable Tax Credits In 2023, IPL and WPL entered into agreements to transfer renewable tax credits from certain wind, solar and battery storage facilities to other corporate taxpayers in exchange for cash. IPL and WPL provided indemnifications associated with $76 million and $22 million, respectively, of proceeds for renewable tax credits transferred to other corporate taxpayers in 2023 in the event of an adverse interpretation of tax law, including whether the related tax credits meet the qualification requirements. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote.

NOTE 13(d) Environmental Matters -
----------------------------------

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Sites IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment. At March 31, 2024, estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, which are not discounted, were as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents

|  | Alliant Energy | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Range of estimated future costs | $8 - $29 | $6 - $18 | $2 - | $11 |
| Current and non-current environmental liabilities | $13 | $8 | $5 |  |

IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential Clean Air Act issues associated with emissions from IPL's coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL's remaining requirements include fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from IPL's electric customers.

Other Environmental Contingencies In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however, future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs and electric and gas distribution systems to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, including the Clean Air Act.

NOTE 13(e) MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints A group of stakeholders, including MISO cooperative and municipal utilities, previously filed complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requesting a reduction to the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners, including ITC Midwest LLC and ATC. In 2019, FERC issued an order on the previously filed complaints and reduced the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners to 9.88% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2020, FERC issued orders in response to various rehearing requests and increased the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners from 9.88% to 10.02% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated FERC's prior orders that established the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners and remanded the cases to FERC for further proceedings, which may result in additional changes to the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners. Any further changes in FERC's decisions may have an impact on Alliant Energy's share of ATC's future earnings and customer costs.

NOTE 13(f) Collective Bargaining Agreements At March 31, 2024, employees covered by collective bargaining agreements represented53%, 70% and 83% of total employees of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively. In August 2024, IPL's collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expires, representing 18% and 53% of total employees of Alliant Energy and IPL, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This MDA includes information relating to Alliant Energy, and IPL and WPL (collectively, the Utilities), as well as ATC Holdings, AEF and Corporate Services. Where appropriate, information relating to a specific entity has been segregated and labeled as such. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the Notes included in this report, as well as the financial statements, notes and MDA included in the 2023 Form 10-K . Unless otherwise noted, all "per share" references in MDA refer to earnings per diluted share.

2024 HIGHLIGHTS
---------------

Key highlights since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K include the following:

Customer Investments:
---------------------

* · In March 2024, IPL completed construction of the Duane Arnold solar facility (50 MW in Linn County, Iowa).
* · In March 2024 and April 2024, FERC and the PSCW, respectively, approved the sales of WPL's partial ownership interests in West Riverside to WEC Energy Group, Inc. (100 MW) and Madison Gas and Electric Company (25 MW). These sales are currently expected to occur in June 2024.
* · In April 2024, WPL received orders from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct improvements at the natural gas-fired Neenah Energy Facility and Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility, which would increase the capacity and efficiency of the EGUs.
* · In April 2024, IPL and WPL entered into agreements to transfer a portion of the renewable tax credits generated in 2024 and 2025 from certain wind, solar and battery storage facilities to other corporate taxpayers in exchange for cash.

Rate Matters:
-------------

* · Refer to Note 3 for discussion of WPL's March 2024 filing for judicial review of PSCW orders related to the recovery and deferral of the return on incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025.

Environmental Matters:
----------------------

* · In April 2024, the EPA issued the final Section 111(d) rule for certain fossil-fueled EGUs and repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The final Section 111(d) rule requires states to implement plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through various Best System of Emission Reduction measures at affected sources, including retirement, enforceable limits on operational capacity, co-firing with low-GHG fuels, or carbon capture and storage technology. State plans are subject to EPA approval, and must be submitted within 24 months of the final rule's effective date, which has not yet been determined. The final rule's compliance requirements will be phased in beginning in 2030 and covers fossil-fueled EGUs that utilize steam boilers to generate electricity, including IPL's coal-fired Ottumwa Generating Station, George Neal Generating Station, Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 3 and Louisa Generating Station, and IPL's natural gasfired Burlington Generating Station and Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 4. The final rule does not apply to EGUs that are retired by January 2032 and is not currently expected to impact WPL's coal-fired Columbia Energy Center or Edgewater Generating Station given current plans to retire these EGUs prior to this deadline. In addition, the final rule does not impact existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines, including IPL's Marshalltown Generating Station and Emery Generating Station, and WPL's Riverside Energy Center and West Riverside Energy Center; however, these EGUs could be subject to future Section 111(d) rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing combustion turbines. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters, including resolution of ongoing litigation that has been suspended while the EPA revised its regulations.
* · In April 2024, the EPA issued final revised standards under Section 111(b), which establishes carbon dioxide emissions limits from certain new and reconstructed fossil-fueled EGU combustion turbines that commenced operation after May 23, 2023 with a capacity greater than 25 MW. The final revised standards do not apply to IPL's Marshalltown Generating Station or WPL's West Riverside Energy Center, which commenced operation prior to the applicability date of the final revised standards. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these revised standards, including resolution of ongoing litigation that has been suspended while the EPA revised its regulations.
* · In April 2024, the EPA issued a final rule that revises discharge limits for specific categories of wastewater from existing coal-fired EGUs. The new limitations will be implemented in each facility's wastewater discharge permits issued by state agencies and become effective as soon as possible but no later than December 31, 2029. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the final rule and are unable to predict with certainty future compliance impacts.
* · In April 2024, the EPA issued revisions to the Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, which significantly expand the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, including some IPL and WPL facilities. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the revised Coal Combustion Residuals Rule and are unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these updates.

Legislative Matters:
--------------------

* · In May 2024, the Major Economic Growth Attraction program was enacted in Iowa, which offers various tax incentives for up to two qualified businesses for c ertain large-scale projects with capital investments greater than $1 billion constructed on certified sites greater than 250 acres in Iowa. The most significant provision of this program for Alliant Energy encourages economic development in IPL's service territory. Alliant Energy has various development-ready sites throughout Iowa, including the 1,300-acre Big Cedar Industrial Center Mega-site in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the 465-acre Prairie View Industrial Center Super Park in Ames, Iowa.
* · In May 2024, legislation was enacted in Iowa related to the advance rate-making principles for certain investments in Iowa. The most signification provisions of this legislation for Alliant Energy would allow IPL to include electric storage and nuclear-fired generation projects in the advance rate-making principles request process prior to making these investments in Iowa, and require IPL to obtain a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUB in order to construct electric storage projects.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------

Financial Results Overview The table below includes EPS for Utilities and Corporate Services, ATC Holdings, and Non-utility and Parent, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy's net income and EPS attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for the three months ended March 31 were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

Table of Contents

|  | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Income (Loss) | EPS | Income (Loss) | EPS |
| Utilities and Corporate Services | $159 | $0.62 | $163 | $0.65 |
| ATC Holdings | 9 | 0.04 | 9 | 0.04 |
| Non-utility and Parent | (10) | (0.04) | (9) | (0.04) |
| Alliant Energy Consolidated | $158 | $0.62 | $163 | $0.65 |

Alliant Energy's Utilities and Corporate Services net income decreased by $4 million for the three-month period, primarily due to lower retail electric and gas sales due to impacts of warmer than normal temperatures during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and higher financing and depreciation expenses. These items were partially offset by higher revenue requirements from WPL's capital investments.

Net Income Variances The following items contributed to increased (decreased) net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (in millions):

Sales Trends and TemperaturesAlliant Energy's retail electric sales volumes decreased 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in sales volumes to industrial customers due to standby service customers that can use other generation and changes in temperatures, partially offset by an additional day of sales due to leap year in 2024. Alliant Energy's retail gas sales volumes decreased 10% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in temperatures, partially offset by an additional day of sales due to leap year in 2024.

Estimated decreases to operating income from the impacts of temperatures for the three months ended March 31 were as follows (in millions):

|  | Electric | Electric | Electric | Gas | Gas | Gas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 | Change | 2024 | 2023 | Change |

| Total Alliant Energy | ($19) | ($9) | ($10) | ($11) | ($6) | ($5) |

Electric Sales for Resale - Bulk Power and OtherBulk power and other volume changes were due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by MISO. These changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of Alliant Energy's EGUs and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. Changes in bulk power and other revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating income.

Gas Transportation/Other Gas transportation/other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in the gas volumes supplied to Alliant Energy's natural gasfired EGUs caused by the availability and dispatch of such EGUs.

Impact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations-
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ratings Triggers In March 2024, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services changed Alliant Energy's and IPL's outlooks from stable to negative. These outlook changes are not expected to have a material impact on Alliant Energy's and IPL's liquidity or collateral obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Certain Financial CommitmentsA summary of Alliant Energy's and IPL's off-balance sheet arrangements and Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's contractual obligations is included in the 2023 Form 10-K and has not changed materially from the items reported in the 2023 Form 10-K , except for the items described in Notes 4 , 7 and 13 .

OTHER MATTERS

Critical Accounting Estimates The summary of critical accounting estimates included in the 2023 Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below.

Long-Lived Assets -
-------------------

Regulated Operations -

Solar Generation Projects Recently Completed or Under Construction - Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect construction costs associated with WPL's approximately 1,100 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately $180 million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW's order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW's retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of March 31, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
------------------------------------------------------------------
