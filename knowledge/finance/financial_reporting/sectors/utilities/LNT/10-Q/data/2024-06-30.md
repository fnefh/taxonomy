## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements contained in this report that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified as such because the statements include words such as "may," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "project," "will," "projections," "estimate," or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL that could materially affect actual results include:

- · IPL's and WPL's ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to allow for, among other things, the recovery of and/or the return on costs, including fuel costs, operating costs, transmission costs, capacity costs, deferred expenditures, deferred tax assets, tax expense, interest expense, capital expenditures, marginal costs to service new customers, and remaining costs related to EGUs that have been or may be permanently closed and certain other retired assets, environmental remediation costs, and decreases in sales volumes, as well as earning their authorized rates of return, payments to their parent of expected levels of dividends, and the impact of rate design on current and potential customers and demand for energy in their service territories;
- · weather effects on utility sales volumes and operations;
- · the impact of IPL's retail electric base rate moratorium, if approved by the IUC;
- · the ability to obtain deferral treatment for the recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs in between rate reviews;
- · IPL's and WPL's ability to obtain rate relief to allow for the return on costs of solar generation projects that exceed initial cost estimates;
- · the direct or indirect effects resulting from cybersecurity incidents or attacks on Alliant Energy, IPL, WPL, or their suppliers, contractors and partners, or responses to such incidents;
- · the impact of customer- and third party-owned generation, including alternative electric suppliers, in IPL's and WPL's service territories on system reliability, operating expenses and customers' demand for electricity;
- · economic conditions and the impact of business or facility closures in IPL's and WPL's service territories;
- · the impact of energy efficiency, franchise retention and customer disconnects on sales volumes and operating income;
- · the impact that price changes may have on IPL's and WPL's customers' demand for electric, gas and steam services and their ability to pay their bills;
- · changes in the price of delivered natural gas, transmission, purchased electricity and delivered coal, particularly during elevated market prices, and any resulting changes to counterparty credit risk, due to shifts in supply and demand caused by market conditions, regulations and MISO's seasonal resource adequacy process;
- · the ability to obtain regulatory approval for construction projects with acceptable conditions;
- · the ability to complete construction of renewable generation and storage projects by planned in-service dates and within the cost targets set by regulators due to cost increases of and access to materials, equipment and commodities, which could result from tariffs, duties or other assessments, such as any additional tariffs resulting from U.S. Department of Commerce investigations into and any decisions made regarding the sourcing of solar project materials and equipment from certain countries, labor issues or supply shortages, the ability to successfully resolve warranty issues or contract disputes, the ability to achieve the expected level of tax benefits based on tax guidelines, project costs and the level of electricity output generated by qualifying generating facilities, and the ability to efficiently utilize the renewable generation and storage project tax benefits for the benefit of customers;
- · the impacts of changes in the tax code, including tax rates, minimum tax rates, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes impacting the availability of and ability to transfer renewable tax credits;
- · the ability to utilize tax credits generated to date, and those that may be generated in the future, before they expire, as well as the ability to transfer tax credits that may be generated in the future at adequate pricing;
- · disruptions to ongoing operations and the supply of materials, services, equipment and commodities needed to construct capital projects, which may result from geopolitical issues, supplier manufacturing constraints, regulatory requirements, labor issues or transportation issues, and thus affect the ability to meet capacity requirements and result in increased capacity expense;

AROs Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the recognition of additional ARO regulatory assets in the second quarter of 2024, substantially resulting from the enactment of the revised CCR Rule.

Assets retired early In May 2023, IPL retired the Lansing Generating Station. IPL is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this EGU from both its retail and wholesale customers. IPL's retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period filed with the IUC in October 2023 included a request for continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing through 2037. In June 2024, IPL reached a partial non-unanimous settlement agreement with certain stakeholders, which is subject to IUC approval. The agreement includes a return of the remaining net book value of Lansing, but does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing. As a result, the return on the remaining net book value is no longer probable of recovery from IPL's retail electric customers, and in the second quarter of 2024, a pre-tax non-cash charge of $60 million was recorded to "Asset valuation charge for IPL's Lansing Generating Station" in Alliant Energy's and IPL's income statements, with a corresponding decrease in Alliant Energy's and IPL's assets retired early regulatory assets. A decision from the IUC on the settlement agreement is currently expected in the third quarter of 2024, with final rates expected to be effective October 1, 2024.

Derivatives Refer to Note 12 for discussion of changes in Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's derivative liabilities/assets during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets.

Regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items (in millions):

Tax-related The increase in Alliant Energy's and WPL's tax-related regulatory liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax benefits resulting from WPL electing investment tax credit treatment for its Cassville solar facility in the second quarter of 2024. A majority of these benefits will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding, with a portion of the benefits passed on to WPL's electric customers in 2024 and 2025.

## NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

WPL currently expects construction costs associated with its approximately1,100 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately $195 million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW's order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW's retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of June 30, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.

In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025. As a result, as of June 30, 2024, Alliant Energy and WPL concluded Edgewater Unit 5 (net book value of $496 million) no longer meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and $806 million was reclassified to utility electric generation plant in service from utility electric plant anticipated to be retired early.

WPL is currently leasing the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility from AEF's Non-utility Generation business. WPL is responsible for the operation of the EGU and has exclusive rights to its output. In May 2024, WPL renewed this financing lease through 2044. There are no lease renewal periods remaining.

In June 2024, WEC Energy Group, Inc. and Madison Gas and Electric Company acquired partial ownership interests in West Riverside. The related proceeds are included in "Proceeds from sales of partial ownership interests in West Riverside" in investing activities in Alliant Energy's and WPL's cash flows statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024. As a result of these transactions, WPL's undivided current ownership interest in West Riverside is 56.6%.

## NOTE 4. RECEIVABLES

Sales of Accounts Receivable IPL maintains a Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (Receivables Agreement) whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. In March 2024, IPL amended and extended through March 2026 the purchase commitment from the third party to which it sells its receivables. The transfers of receivables meet the criteria for sale accounting established by the transfer of financial assets accounting rules. Effective May 2024, the limit on cash proceeds under the Receivables Agreement was changed to $110 million. As of June 30, 2024, IPL had $65 million of available capacity under its sales of accounts receivable program. IPL's maximum and average outstanding aggregate cash proceeds (based on daily outstanding balances) related to the sales of accounts receivable program for the three and six months ended June 30 were as follows (in millions):

NOTE 7(b) Long-term Debt In March 2024, AEF entered into a $300 million variable rate (6% as of June 30, 2024) term loan credit agreement (with Alliant Energy as guarantor), which expires in March 2025. This term loan credit agreement amends and restates the term loan credit agreement that expired in March 2024, and retired the $300 million variable rate term loan set forth therein. AEF's restated term loan credit agreement includes an option to increase the amount outstanding with one or more additional term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million.

In June 2024, AEF issued $375 million of 5.4% senior notes due 2027 (with Alliant Energy as guarantor). The net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce Alliant Energy's outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2024, WPL issued $300 million of 5.375% debentures due 2034. WPL's debentures were issued as green bonds, and an amount equal to or in excess of the net proceeds will be allocated or disbursed for the development and acquisition of WPL's solar EGUs.

Convertible Senior Notes As of June 30, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of Alliant Energy's convertible senior notes due 2026 (the Notes) to convert their Notes were not met, and as a result, the Notes were classified as "Long-term debt, net" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. As of June 30, 2024, the net carrying amount of the Notes was $570 million, with unamortized debt issuance costs of $5 million, and the estimated fair value (Level 2) of the Notes was $568 million. As of June 30, 2024, there were no shares of Alliant Energy's common stock related to the potential conversion of the Notes included in diluted EPS based on Alliant Energy's average stock prices and the relevant terms of the Notes.

## NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Rates Overall effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, which were computed by dividing income tax expense (benefit) by income before income taxes, were as follows. The effective income tax rates were different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, production tax credits, investment tax credits, amortization of excess deferred taxes and the effect of rate-making on property-related differences. Also impacting Alliant Energy's and IPL's effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were the pre-tax non-cash charge of $60 million for IPL's Lansing Generation Station discussed in Note 2 and the pre-tax non-cash charge of $20 million for the portion of recorded AROs allocated to IPL's steam business discussed in Note 11 .

As of June 30, 2024, Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $19 million, $9 million and $8 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between1 year and 2 years.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, performance shares and restricted stock units were granted to key employees under the equity-based compensation plans as follows. These shares and units will be paid out in shares of common stock, and are therefore accounted for as equity awards.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Alliant Energy's and IPL's derivative assets increased primarily due to new FTRs resulting from the annual FTR auction in the second quarter of 2024 operated by MISO. Based on IPL's and WPL's cost recovery mechanisms, the majority of changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets result in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets.

Credit Risk-related Contingent Features Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered.

Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, derivative assets and derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts would have been presented on the balance sheets as follows (in millions):

| December 31, 2023      |                     |                  |                     |       |                     |       |
| Derivative assets      | 88                  | 47               | 54                  | 32    | 34                  | 15    |
| Derivative liabilities | 98                  | 57               | 30                  | 8     | 68                  | 49    |

Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement.

Interest Rate Derivative The interest rate derivative associated with AEF's interest rate swap maturing in January 2026 was valued based on quoted prices that utilize current market interest rate forecasts. As of June 30, 2024, $3 million of non-current interest rate derivative assets was recorded in "Deferred charges and other" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. This interest rate derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge, with changes in fair value recorded as other comprehensive income/loss. As of June 30, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive income included $3 million of income related to the interest rate swap. Reductions to interest expense of $1 million and $2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $1 million and $1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, were recorded in Alliant Energy's income statement related to the interest rate swap.

## NOTE 14(c) Guarantees and Indemnifications -

Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum) In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum, an independent oil and gas company. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. Based on information made available to Alliant Energy by Whiting Petroleum, the Whiting Petroleum affiliate holds an approximate 6% share in the partnerships, and currently known obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. The general partnerships were formed under California law, and Alliant Energy Resources, LLC may need to perform under the guarantees if the affiliate of Whiting Petroleum is unable to meet its partnership obligations.

In 2022, Whiting Petroleum completed a business combination with Oasis Petroleum Inc., resulting in Chord Energy Corporation. In May 2024, Chord Energy Corporation completed a business combination with Enerplus Corporation. These business combinations are not expected to affect the scope of the Whiting Petroleum affiliate's partnership obligations or Alliant Energy's related guarantees; however, such business combinations substantially reduce the likelihood that Alliant Energy will be obligated to make any payments under these guarantees.

As of June 30, 2024, the currently known partnership obligations for the abandonment obligations are estimated at $49 million, which represents Alliant Energy's currently estimated maximum exposure under the guarantees. Alliant Energy is not currently aware of, nor does it currently expect to incur in the future, any material liabilities related to these guarantees and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to these guarantees as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Non-utility Wind Farm in OklahomaIn 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF acquired a cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm located in Oklahoma. The wind farm provides electricity to a third party under a long-term PPA. Alliant Energy provided a parent guarantee of its subsidiary's indemnification obligations under the related operating agreement and PPA. Alliant Energy's obligations under the operating agreement were $51 million as of June 30, 2024 and will reduce annually until expiring in July 2047. Alliant Energy's obligations under the PPA are subject to a maximum limit of $17 million and expire in December 2031, subject to potential extension. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to this guarantee that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Transfers of Renewable Tax Credits In 2023 and 2024, IPL and WPL entered into agreements to transfer renewable tax credits from certain wind, solar and battery storage facilities to other corporate taxpayers in exchange for cash. As of June 30, 2024, IPL and WPL provided indemnifications associated with $147 million and $50 million, respectively, of proceeds for renewable tax credits transferred to other corporate taxpayers in the event of an adverse interpretation of tax law, including whether the related tax credits meet the qualification requirements. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote.

## NOTE 14(d) Environmental Matters -

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Sites IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment. At June 30, 2024, estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, which are not discounted, were as follows (in millions):

IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential Clean Air Act issues associated with emissions from IPL's coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL's remaining requirements include fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from IPL's electric customers.

Other Environmental Contingencies In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however, future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs and electric and gas distribution systems to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, CCR Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, including the Clean Air Act.

NOTE 14(e) MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints A group of stakeholders, including MISO cooperative and municipal utilities, previously filed complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requesting a reduction to the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners, including ITC Midwest LLC and ATC. In 2019, FERC issued an order on the previously filed complaints and reduced the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners to 9.88% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2020, FERC issued orders in response to various rehearing requests and increased the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners from 9.88% to 10.02% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated FERC's prior orders that established the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners and remanded the cases to FERC for further proceedings, which may result in additional changes to the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners. Any further changes in FERC's decisions may have an impact on Alliant Energy's share of ATC's future earnings and customer costs.

NOTE 14(f) Collective Bargaining Agreements At June 30, 2024, employees covered by collective bargaining agreements represented53%, 70% and 83% of total employees of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively. In August 2024, IPL's collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expires, representing 18% and 54% of total employees of Alliant Energy and IPL, respectively. While the process to renew the agreement is underway and a tentative agreement has been reached, Alliant Energy and IPL are currently unable to predict the outcome.

## NOTE 15. SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

Certain financial information relating to Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's business segments is as follows. Intersegment revenues were not material to their respective operations. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of asset valuation charges recorded in the second quarter of 2024 related to IPL's Lansing Generating Station, which decreased the assets for "Utility - Electric," and Note 11 for discussion of additional AROs recorded in the second quarter of 2024 substantially due to the enactment of the revised CCR Rule, which primarily increased the assets for "Utility - Electric."

## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This MDA includes information relating to Alliant Energy, and IPL and WPL (collectively, the Utilities), as well as ATC Holdings, AEF and Corporate Services. Where appropriate, information relating to a specific entity has been segregated and labeled as such. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the Notes included in this report, as well as the financial statements, notes and MDA included in the 2023 Form 10-K . Unless otherwise noted, all "per share" references in MDA refer to earnings per diluted share.

## 2024 HIGHLIGHTS

Key highlights since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K include the following:

## Customer Investments:

- · In March 2024, IPL completed construction of the Duane Arnold solar facility (50 MW in Linn County, Iowa).
- · In April 2024, WPL received orders from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct improvements at the natural gas-fired Neenah Energy Facility and Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility, which would increase the capacity and efficiency of the EGUs.
- · In April 2024 and June 2024, IPL and WPL entered into agreements to transfer a portion of the renewable tax credits generated in 2024 and 2025 from certain wind, solar and battery storage facilities to other corporate taxpayers in exchange for cash.
- · In May 2024, WPL completed construction of the Grant County solar facility (200 MW in Grant County, Wisconsin).
- · In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025.
- · In July 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations awarded WPL's Columbia Energy Storage Project, a 20 MW carbon dioxidebased long-duration energy storage system at the Columbia Energy Center (currently expected to be retired by June 1, 2026) site, up to approximately $30 million in grant funding during construction of the project. WPL currently expects to submit project plans to the PSCW later in 2024.
- · In July 2024, WPL filed a certificate of authority application with the PSCW for approval to repower the Bent Tree wind farm, which would be eligible for production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. A decision from the PSCW is currently expected in 2025.

## Rate Matters:

- · In October 2023, IPL filed a retail electric and gas rate review with the IUC for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. In June 2024, IPL reached a partial, non-unanimous settlement agreement with certain stakeholders, which is subject to IUC approval. Final rates are expected to be effective October 1, 2024. The settlement agreement reflects the following:
- · Annual retail electric base rate increase of $185 million, with customers receiving credits for the first 12 months through a tax benefit rider, a subsequent retail electric base rate moratorium through September 2029, and an average retail electric rate base of $7,279 million;
- · Annual retail gas base rate increase of $10 million, and an average retail gas rate base of $630 million;
- · Return on common equity of 9.65% (for all assets that to do not have advance ratemaking principles) and a 51% common equity component of its regulatory capital structure;
- · Key drivers include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation, as well as updated depreciation rates and certain incremental costs and benefits incurred resulting from the 2020 derecho windstorm;
- · Earnings sharing mechanism beginning in 2025, where IPL would apply excess earnings to the remaining net book value of IPL's highest earning asset with advance ratemaking principles (currently the Emery Generation Station) based on its authorized return on common equity as follows;

| Threshold Above Authorized Return on Common Equity   | Sharing                |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| First 50 basis points                                | 75% customers, 25% IPL |
| >50 to 100 basis points                              | 50% customers, 50% IPL |
| >100 to 150 basis points                             | 25% customers, 75% IPL |
| >150 basis points                                    | 100% customers         |

- · Creation of an individual customer rate tariff, which would allow IPL to attract new load growth to its service territory;
- · Electric distribution system investment cap not to exceed $900 million in aggregate or $325 million in any given year from 2026 through 2029, with certain exceptions;
- · IPL to retain renewable tax benefits and energy margins for new generation resources, as well as retain renewable tax benefits from the repowering of existing wind farms, including the Franklin County wind farm;
- · Discontinuation of the renewable energy rider; and
- · A return of the remaining net book value of the Lansing Generating Station; however, the agreement does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing, resulting in Alliant Energy and IPL recording a pre-tax non-cash charge of $60 million to "Asset valuation charge for IPL's Lansing Generating Station" in their income statements in the second quarter of 2024.
- · In July 2024, the PSCW issued an oral decision authorizing WPL to refund $34 million, plus interest, to its retail electric customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 for fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2023 that were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period.
- · Refer to Note 3 for discussion of WPL's March 2024 filing for judicial review of PSCW orders related to the recovery and deferral of the return on incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025.

## Growing Customer Demand:

- · Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are pursuing opportunities for customer growth, including new customers at Alliant Energy's development-ready sites in Iowa and Wisconsin, and have executed various agreements for data centers. The timing and amount of increases in load are subject to various factors, including interconnections, and any executed or future agreements with customers are not expected to result in immediate increases in load.

## Environmental Matters:

- · In May 2024, the EPA enacted the revised CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, including some IPL and WPL facilities. As a result, as discussed in Note 11 , Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recorded additional AROs in the second quarter of 2024. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to evaluate the revised CCR Rule and are unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these updates, including resolution of ongoing litigation.
- · In May 2024, the EPA enacted the final Section 111(d) rule for certain fossil-fueled EGUs and repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The final Section 111(d) rule requires states to implement plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through various Best System of Emission Reduction measures at affected sources, including retirement, enforceable limits on operational capacity, co-firing with low-greenhouse gases fuels, or carbon capture and storage technology. State plans are subject to EPA approval, and must be submitted by May 2026. The final rule's compliance requirements will be phased in beginning in 2030 and covers fossilfueled EGUs that utilize steam boilers to generate electricity, including IPL's coal-fired Ottumwa Generating Station, George Neal Generating Station, Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 3 and Louisa Generating Station, WPL's coal-fired Edgewater Generating Station Unit 5 (WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals), and IPL's natural gas-fired Burlington Generating Station and Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 4. The final rule does not apply to EGUs that are retired by January 2032 and is not currently expected to impact WPL's coal-fired Columbia Energy Center given current plans to retire this EGU prior to this deadline. In addition, the final rule does not impact existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines, including IPL's Marshalltown Generating Station and Emery Generating Station, and WPL's Riverside Energy Center and West Riverside Energy Center; however, these EGUs could be subject to future Section 111(d) rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing combustion turbines. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters, including resolution of ongoing litigation.
- · In May 2024, the EPA enacted final revised standards under Section 111(b), which establishes carbon dioxide emissions limits from certain new and reconstructed fossil-fueled EGU combustion turbines that commenced operation after May 23, 2023 with a capacity greater than 25 MW. The final revised standards do not apply to IPL's Marshalltown Generating Station or WPL's West Riverside Energy Center, which commenced operation prior to the applicability date of the final revised standards. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these revised standards, including resolution of ongoing litigation.
- · In May 2024, the EPA enacted a final rule that revises discharge limits for specific categories of wastewater from existing coal-fired EGUs. The new limitations will be implemented in each facility's wastewater discharge permits issued by state agencies and become effective as soon as possible but no later than December 31, 2029. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the final rule and are unable to predict with certainty future compliance impacts, including resolution of ongoing litigation; however, costs to comply with this rule could have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.

## Legislative Matters:

- · In May 2024, the Major Economic Growth Attraction program was enacted in Iowa, which offers various tax incentives for up to two qualified businesses for c ertain large-scale projects with capital investments greater than $1 billion constructed on certified sites greater than 250 acres in Iowa. The most significant provision of this program for Alliant Energy encourages economic development in IPL's service territory. Alliant Energy has various development-ready sites throughout Iowa, including the 1,300-acre Big Cedar Industrial Center Mega-site in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the 465-acre Prairie View Industrial Center Super Park in Ames, Iowa.
- · In May 2024, legislation was enacted in Iowa related to the advance rate-making principles for certain investments in Iowa. The most significant provisions of this legislation for Alliant Energy would allow IPL to include electric storage and nuclear-fired generation projects in the advance rate-making principles request process prior to making these investments in Iowa, and require IPL to obtain a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUC in order to construct electric storage projects.

## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial Results Overview The table below includes EPS for Utilities and Corporate Services, ATC Holdings, and Non-utility and Parent, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy's net income and EPS attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for the three months ended June 30 were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

| Alliant Energy Consolidated      | $87           | $0.34  | $160          | $0.64  |

Alliant Energy's Utilities and Corporate Services net income decreased by $79 million for the three-month period, primarily due to an asset valuation charge for IPL's Lansing Generating Station as a result of the proposed rate review settlement, an ARO charge allocated to the steam business at IPL due to the revised CCR Rule, the timing of income taxes, higher financing and depreciation expenses, estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales, and changes in WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries. These items were partially offset by higher revenue requirements from WPL's capital investments.

Net Income Variances The following items contributed to increased (decreased) net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 (in millions):

Sales Trends and TemperaturesAlliant Energy's retail electric sales volumes decreased 1% and 2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to changes in sales volumes to IPL's industrial customers due to standby service customers that can use other generation and changes in temperatures. Alliant Energy's retail gas sales volumes decreased 9% and 10% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to changes in temperatures. The six-month decrease in sales was partially offset by an extra day of sales during the first quarter of 2024 due to leap year.

Estimated increases (decreases) to operating income from the impacts of temperatures for the three and six months ended June 30 were as follows (in millions):

Electric Sales for Resale - Bulk Power and OtherBulk power and other volume changes were due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by MISO. These changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of Alliant Energy's EGUs and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. Changes in bulk power and other revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating income.

Gas Transportation/Other Gas transportation/other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in the gas volumes supplied to Alliant Energy's natural gasfired EGUs caused by the availability and dispatch of such EGUs.

## Impact of Credit Ratings on Liquidity and Collateral Obligations-

Ratings Triggers In March 2024, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services changed Alliant Energy's and IPL's outlooks from stable to negative. These outlook changes are not expected to have a material impact on Alliant Energy's and IPL's liquidity or collateral obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Certain Financial CommitmentsA summary of Alliant Energy's and IPL's off-balance sheet arrangements and Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's contractual obligations is included in the 2023 Form 10-K and has not changed materially from the items reported in the 2023 Form 10-K , except for the items described in Notes 4 , 7 and 14 .

## OTHER MATTERS

Critical Accounting Estimates The summary of critical accounting estimates included in the 2023 Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below.

Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities In May 2023, IPL retired the Lansing Generating Station. IPL is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this EGU from both its retail and wholesale customers. IPL's retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period filed with the IUC in October 2023 included a request for continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing through 2037. IPL's partial non-unanimous rate review settlement agreement filed with the IUC in June 2024 includes a return of the remaining net book value of Lansing; however, the agreement does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing, therefore the return on the remaining net book value is no longer probable of recovery from IPL's retail electric customers. As a result, in the second quarter of 2024, a pre-tax non-cash charge of $60 million was recorded to "Asset valuation charge for IPL's Lansing Generating Station" in Alliant Energy's and IPL's income statements, with a corresponding decrease in Alliant Energy's and

## Table of Contents

IPL's assets retired early regulatory assets. A decision from the IUC on the settlement agreement is currently expected in the third quarter of 2024.

## Long-Lived Assets -

## Regulated Operations -

Generating Units Subject to Early Retirement - In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025. As a result, Alliant Energy and WPL concluded Edgewater Unit 5 no longer meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of June 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of Edgewater Unit 5.

Solar Generation Projects Recently Completed or Under Construction - Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect construction costs associated with WPL's approximately 1,100 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately $195 million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW's order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW's retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of June 30, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.

AROs The fair value of a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset is recorded as a liability when an asset is placed in service, when a legal obligation is subsequently identified or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement costs. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions, including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation and discount rates. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. The estimates are subject to change and future updates could have a material impact on Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's financial condition and results of operations. In the second quarter of 2024, substantially due to the enactment of the revised CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recorded additional AROs of $355 million, $102 million and $253 million, respectively. These amounts are expected to be adjusted in the future as additional information is obtained for the specific site closure plans, including the determination of whether or not individual sites are considered legal obligations and the acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which could change management assumptions and result in a material change to the recorded ARO amounts. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of AROs.

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk are reported in the 2023 Form 10-K and have not changed materially.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's management evaluated, with the participation of each of Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Disclosure Committee, the effectiveness of the design and operation of Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of June 30, 2024 pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

There was no change in Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Alliant Energy's, IPL's or WPL's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

None. SEC regulations require Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to disclose information about certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL reasonably believe will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period.
