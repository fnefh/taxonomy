## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements contained in this report that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified as such because the statements include words such as "may," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "project," "will," "projections," "estimate," or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL that could materially affect actual results include:

- · the direct or indirect effects resulting from cybersecurity incidents or attacks on Alliant Energy, IPL, WPL, or their suppliers, contractors and partners, or responses to such incidents;
- · the impact of customer- and third party-owned generation, including alternative electric suppliers, in IPL's and WPL's service territories on system reliability, operating expenses and customers' demand for electricity;
- · the impact of energy efficiency, franchise retention and customer disconnects on sales volumes and margins;
- · the impact that price changes may have on IPL's and WPL's customers' demand for electric, gas and steam services and their ability to pay their bills;
- · inflation and higher interest rates;
- · changes in the price of delivered natural gas, transmission, purchased electricity and delivered coal, particularly during elevated market prices, and any resulting changes to counterparty credit risk, due to shifts in supply and demand caused by market conditions, regulations and MISO's seasonal resource adequacy process;
- · IPL's and WPL's ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to allow for, among other things, the recovery of and/or the return on costs, including fuel costs, operating costs, transmission costs, capacity costs, deferred expenditures, deferred tax assets, tax expense, interest expense, capital expenditures, and remaining costs related to EGUs that may be permanently closed and certain other retired assets, decreases in sales volumes, earning their authorized rates of return, and the payments to their parent of expected levels of dividends;
- · the ability to obtain regulatory approval for construction projects with acceptable conditions;
- · the ability to complete construction of renewable generation and storage projects by planned in-service dates and within the cost targets set by regulators due to cost increases of and access to materials, equipment and commodities, which could result from tariffs, duties or other assessments, such as any additional tariffs resulting from U.S. Department of Commerce investigations into and any decisions made regarding the sourcing of solar project materials and equipment from certain countries, labor issues or supply shortages, the ability to successfully resolve warranty issues or contract disputes, the ability to achieve the expected level of tax benefits based on tax guidelines, project costs and the level of electricity output generated by qualifying generating facilities, and the ability to efficiently utilize the renewable generation and storage project tax benefits for the benefit of customers;
- · the ability to utilize tax credits generated to date, and those that may be generated in the future, before they expire, as well as the ability to transfer tax credits that may be generated in the future at adequate pricing;
- · disruptions to ongoing operations and the supply of materials, services, equipment and commodities needed to construct solar generation, battery storage and electric and gas distribution projects, which may result from geopolitical issues, supplier manufacturing constraints, labor issues or transportation issues, and thus affect the ability to meet capacity requirements and result in increased capacity expense;
- · the future development of technologies related to electrification, and the ability to reliably store and manage electricity;
- · federal and state regulatory or governmental actions, including the impact of legislation, and regulatory agency orders;
- · the impacts of changes in the tax code, including tax rates, minimum tax rates, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes impacting the availability of renewable tax credits;

- · weather effects on results of utility operations;
- · continued access to the capital markets on competitive terms and rates, and the actions of credit rating agencies;
- · changes to MISO's resource adequacy process establishing capacity planning reserve margin and capacity accreditation requirements that may impact how and when new and existing generating facilities, including IPL's and WPL's additional solar generation, may be accredited with energy capacity, and may require IPL and WPL to adjust their current resource plans, to add resources to meet the requirements of MISO's process, or procure capacity in the market whereby such costs might not be recovered in rates;
- · issues associated with environmental remediation and environmental compliance, including compliance with all environmental and emissions permits and future changes in environmental laws and regulations, including changes to the Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and federal, state or local regulations for greenhouse gases emissions reductions from new and existing fossil-fueled EGUs under the Clean Air Act, and litigation associated with environmental requirements;
- · increased pressure from customers, investors and other stakeholders to more rapidly reduce greenhouse gases emissions;
- · the ability to defend against environmental claims brought by state and federal agencies, such as the EPA and state natural resources agencies, or third parties, such as the Sierra Club, and the impact on operating expenses of defending and resolving such claims;
- · the direct or indirect effects resulting from breakdown or failure of equipment in the operation of electric and gas distribution systems, such as mechanical problems and explosions or fires, and compliance with electric and gas transmission and distribution safety regulations, including regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration;
- · issues related to the availability and operations of EGUs, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, availability of warranty coverage and successful resolution of warranty issues or contract disputes for equipment breakdowns or failures, performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, operator error, employee safety, transmission constraints, compliance with mandatory reliability standards and risks related to recovery of resulting incremental operating, fuel-related and capital costs through rates;

- · risks associated with operation and ownership of non-utility holdings;

## Table of Contents

In January 2023, AEF received $50 million of proceeds from its December 2022 term loan credit agreement, which was classified as "Other short-term borrowings" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.

NOTE 7(b) Long-term Debt In September 2023, IPL issued $300 million of 5.70% senior debentures due 2033. The net proceeds from IPL's issuance were used to reduce cash amounts received from its sales of accounts receivable program, reduce commercial paper classified as long-term debt, for general corporate purposes and/or were placed in money market fund investments. In June 2023, AEF retired its $400 million 3.75% senior notes. In March 2023, WPL issued $300 million of 4.95% debentures due 2033. WPL's debentures were issued as green bonds, and an amount equal to or in excess of the net proceeds were disbursed for the development and acquisition of its solar EGUs.

Convertible Senior Notes In March 2023, Alliant Energy issued $575 million of 3.875% convertible senior notes (the Notes), which are senior unsecured obligations, and used the net proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2026 unless earlier converted or repurchased, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Alliant Energy may not redeem the Notes prior to the maturity date. Holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances:

- · during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2023 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Alliant Energy's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day during such period;
- · during the 5 business day period after any10 consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price (as defined in the related Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Alliant Energy's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or
- · upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.

On or after December 15, 2025 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion of the Notes, Alliant Energy will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted.

The initial conversion rate is 15.5461 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $64.32 per share of Alliant Energy's common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, Alliant Energy will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event.

If Alliant Energy undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the related Indenture), then, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require Alliant Energy to repurchase for cash all or any portion of its Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

As of September 30, 2023, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert their Notes were not met, and as a result, the Notes were classified as "Long-term debt, net" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, the net carrying amount of the Notes was $567 million, with unamortized debt issuance costs of $8 million, and the estimated fair value (Level 2) of the Notes was $556 million. As of September 30, 2023, there were no shares of Alliant Energy's common stock related to the potential conversion of the Notes included in diluted EPS based on Alliant Energy's average stock prices and the relevant terms of the Notes.

## NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Rates Overall effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, which were computed by dividing income tax expense (benefit) by income before income taxes, were as follows. The effective income tax rates were different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, production tax credits, amortization of excess deferred taxes and the effect of rate-making on property-related differences.

Iowa Tax Reform - Pursuant to Iowa tax reform enacted in 2022, in September 2023, the Iowa Department of Revenue announced an Iowa corporate income tax rate of 7.1%, effective January 1, 2024. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Given the announcement of the new Iowa corporate income tax rate, Alliant Energy's and IPL's deferred tax liabilities were remeasured based upon the new rate effective January 1, 2024, which resulted in a $73 million reduction of Alliant Energy's and IPL's tax-related regulatory assets and a corresponding decrease in their deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter of 2023. The reduction in tax-related regulatory assets is expected to provide cost benefits to IPL's customers in the future. Alliant Energy parent company's deferred tax assets were remeasured based upon the new rate effective January 1, 2024, which resulted in a charge of $8 million recorded to income tax expense in Alliant Energy's income statement and an increase in deferred tax liabilities on Alliant Energy's balance sheet in the third quarter of 2023. Based on the remeasurement of Alliant Energy parent company's deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2022 for the Iowa corporate income tax rate of 8.4% effective January 1, 2023, a charge of $8 million was recorded to income tax expense in Alliant Energy's income statement in the third quarter of 2022. Alliant Energy is currently unable to predict with certainty the timing or amount of any future rate reductions.

As of September 30, 2023, Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $11 million, $6 million and $5 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between1 year and 2 years.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, performance shares, performance restricted stock units and restricted stock units were granted to key employees under existing plans as follows. These shares and units will be paid out in shares of common stock, and are therefore accounted for as equity awards.

| | Grants | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance shares | 108,513 | $55.68 |
| Performance restricted stock units | 123,990 | 52.71 |
| Restricted stock units | 105,982 | 52.77 |

As of September 30, 2023, 274,960 shares were included in the calculation of diluted EPS related to the nonvested equity awards.

## NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

## Commodity Derivatives -

Notional Amounts As of September 30, 2023, gross notional amounts and settlement/delivery years related to outstanding swap contracts, option contracts, physical forward contracts and FTRs that were accounted for as commodity derivative instruments were as follows (units in thousands):

| | Electricity | Electricity | FTRs | FTRs | Natural Gas | Natural Gas | Coal | Coal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Financial Statement Presentation Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value each reporting date on the balance sheets as assets or liabilities as follows (in millions):

| | Alliant Energy | Alliant Energy | IPL | IPL | WPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |

| Current derivative liabilities | 32 | 59 | 15 | 40 | 17 | 19 |
| Non-current derivative liabilities | 34 | 20 | 6 | 6 | 28 | 14 |

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's derivative assets decreased primarily due to settlements of natural gas, FTR and electricity contracts and lower natural gas prices, partially offset by new FTRs resulting from the annual FTR auction in the second quarter of 2023 operated by MISO. Alliant Energy's and IPL's derivative liabilities decreased primarily due to settlement of natural gas contracts. Based on IPL's and WPL's cost recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets.

Credit Risk-related Contingent Features Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that

would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered.

Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, derivative assets and derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts would have been presented on the balance sheets as follows (in millions):

Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement.

Interest Rate Derivative In January 2023, AEF entered into a $300 million interest rate swap maturing in January 2026 to mitigate interest rate risk. Under the terms of the swap, AEF exchanged a variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate of 3.93% on a portion of its variable-rate term loan borrowings. The related interest rate derivative was valued based on quoted prices that utilize current market interest rate forecasts. As of September 30, 2023, $6 mi llion of non-current interest rate derivative assets was recorded in "Deferred charges and other" on Alliant Energy's balance sheet. This interest rate derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge, with changes in fair value recorded as other comprehensive income/loss. As of September 30, 2023, accumulated other comprehensive income included $4 million of income related to the interest rate swap. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $1 million and $2 million, respe ctively, of reductions to interest expense were recorded in Alliant Energy's income statement related to the interest rate swap.

## NOTE 13(c) Guarantees and Indemnifications -

Whiting Petroleum Whiting Petroleum is an independent oil and gas company. In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. Based on information made available to Alliant Energy by Whiting Petroleum, the Whiting Petroleum affiliate holds an approximate 6% share in the partnerships, and currently known obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. The general partnerships were formed under California law, and Alliant Energy Resources, LLC may need to perform under the guarantees if the affiliate of Whiting Petroleum is unable to meet its partnership obligations.

As of September 30, 2023, the currently known partnership obligations for the abandonment obligations are estimated at $58 million, which represents Alliant Energy's currently estimated maximum exposure under the guarantees. Alliant Energy estimates its expected loss to be a portion of the $58 million of known partnership abandonment obligations of the Whiting Petroleum affiliate and the other partners. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to these guarantees that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay; however, as of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, a liability of $5 million is recorded in "Other liabilities" on Alliant Energy's balance sheets for expected credit losses related to the contingent obligations that are in the scope of these guarantees.

Whiting Petroleum completed a business combination with Oasis Petroleum Inc. in July 2022. The combined operations are now known as Chord Energy Corporation. The business combination is not expected to affect the scope of the Whiting Petroleum affiliate's obligations to Alliant Energy or Alliant Energy's related guarantees.

Non-utility Wind Farm in OklahomaIn 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF acquired a cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm located in Oklahoma. The wind farm provides electricity to a third party under a long-term PPA. Alliant Energy provided a parent guarantee of its subsidiary's indemnification obligations under the related operating agreement and PPA. Alliant Energy's obligations under the operating agreement were $51 million as of September 30, 2023 and will reduce annually until expiring in July 2047. Alliant Energy's obligations under the PPA are subject to a maximum limit of $17 million and expire in December 2031, subject to potential extension. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to this guarantee that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

## NOTE 13(d) Environmental Matters -

Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Sites IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment. At September 30, 2023, estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, which are not discounted, were as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents

| | Alliant Energy | IPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Range of estimated future costs | $9 - $36 | $5 - | $4 - $25 |
| Current and non-current environmental liabilities | $18 | $8 | $10 |

IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential Clean Air Act issues associated with emissions from IPL's coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL's remaining requirements include fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from IPL's electric customers.

Other Environmental Contingencies In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however, future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs and electric and gas distribution systems to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, including the Clean Air Act.

NOTE 13(e) MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints A group of stakeholders, including MISO cooperative and municipal utilities, previously filed complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requesting a reduction to the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners, including ITC Midwest LLC and ATC. In 2019, FERC issued an order on the previously filed complaints and reduced the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners to 9.88% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2020, FERC issued orders in response to various rehearing requests and increased the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners from 9.88% to 10.02% for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In August 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated FERC's prior orders that established the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners and remanded the cases to FERC for further proceedings, which may result in additional changes to the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners. Any further changes in FERC's decisions may have an impact on Alliant Energy's share of ATC's future earnings and customer costs.

## 2023 HIGHLIGHTS

Key highlights since the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K include the following:

## Customer Investments:

- · In 2021, IPL filed for advance rate-making principles with the IUB for up to 400 MW of solar generation and 75 MW of battery storage. In April 2023, the IUB approved advance rate-making principles for up to 200 MW of solar generation. The IUB's order included a cost target of $1,575/kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission upgrade costs among other costs. In May 2023, IPL requested reconsideration of certain ratemaking principles for the up to 200 MW of solar generation, including the cost target and return on common equity. In June 2023, IPL and the IUB filed a joint motion for remand of the other 200 MW of solar generation and 75 MW of battery storage for further reconsideration by the IUB, which was granted by the court. In June 2023, the IUB granted reconsideration of advance rate-making principles for the 400 MW of solar generation and 75 MW of battery storage. In October 2023, the IUB issued an order approving a modified non-unanimous settlement agreement with the Iowa Office of Consumer Advocate among other stakeholders, for up to 400 MW of solar generation, subject to a cost target of $1,650/kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission upgrade costs among other costs, and a related return on common equity of no less than 10.25% with the opportunity to request a higher return on common equity in future IPL retail electric rate review filings. Any reasonable and prudent costs incurred in excess of the cost target are eligible for recovery at the return on common equity determined in IPL retail electric rate review filings. The IUB's order also included a consumer protection plan, which monitors IPL's achievement of certain aggregate summer capacity factors for the up to 400 MW of solar generation projects during June, July and August each calendar year over 30 years. Actual three-year rolling average summer capacity factors will be compared to target capacity factors, which may result in surpluses or deficits that would be offset against one another and contribute to an accumulated balance in a given calendar year. Surpluses or deficits will be capped at $3 million in aggregate per year. At the end of the program, any accumulated deficit balance would be addressed in IPL's next rate review, and any accumulated surplus balance would not result in any return to IPL. In November 2023, IPL accepted these advance rate-making principles.
- · In October 2023, WPL received an oral decision from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct, own and operate approximately 99 MW of battery storage at the Edgewater Generating Station.
- · In August 2023, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct, own and operate 175 MW of battery storage, with 100 MW and 75 MW at the Grant County and Wood County solar projects, respectively.
- · In June 2023, WPL filed requests with the PSCW for approval to construct improvements at the natural gas-fired Neenah Energy Facility and Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility, which would increase the capacity and efficiency of the EGUs. A decision from the PSCW is currently expected by the second quarter of 2024.
- · In April 2023, the IUB issued a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) granting IPL approval to construct, own and operate up to 150 MW of solar generation and up to 75 MW of battery storage at the Wever project in Lee County, Iowa. In March 2023, the IUB issued a GCU Certificate granting IPL approval to construct, own and operate up to 50 MW of solar generation and up to 25 MW of battery storage at the Creston project in Union County, Iowa. These solar projects are included in the IUB's October 2023 order approving advance rate-making principles for up to 400 MW of solar generation.

## Rate Matters:

- · In April 2023, WPL filed a retail electric and gas rate review with the PSCW for the 2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period. The key drivers for the filing include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation and battery storage. The filing requested approval for WPL to implement increases in annual rates for its retail electric and gas customers of $111 million and $17 million in 2024, respectively, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on January 1, 2024. WPL's filing also requested approval to implement an additional $71 million increase in annual rates for its retail electric customers in 2025, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on January 1, 2025. WPL also requested to maintain its current authorized return on common equity of 10% and implement an approximate 56% common equity component of its regulatory capital structure, as well as receive continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of Edgewater Unit 5, which is currently expected to be retired by June 1, 2025. A decision from the PSCW is currently expected by the end of 2023.
- · In October 2023, IPL filed a retail electric and gas rate review with the IUB for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. The key drivers for the filing include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation and repowering of the existing Franklin County wind farm. The filing requested approval for IPL to implement increases in annual rates for its retail electric and gas customers of $160 million and $14 million, respectively, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on October 1, 2024. IPL's filing also requested approval to implement an additional $124 million increase in annual rates for its retail electric customers in 2025, with any granted rate changes expected to be effective on October 1, 2025. IPL also requested a return on common equity of 10% and a 52% common equity component of its regulatory capital structure, as well as to receive continued recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of the Lansing Generating Station through 2037, which was retired in May 2023. A decision from the IUB is currently expected by the third quarter of 2024.
- · In August 2023, the PSCW authorized WPL to collect $117 million in higher rates, plus interest, from its retail electric customers from October 2023 through December 2025 for fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2022 that were higher than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period.

## Legislative Matters:

- · Refer to Note 9 for discussion of the Iowa corporate income tax rate that will be effective January 1, 2024, pursuant to Iowa tax reform enacted in 2022.

## Financings and Common Stock Dividends:

- · Refer to " Results of Operations " for discussion of expected future issuances of common stock and common stock dividends, and expected future issuances and retirements of long-term debt, by the end of 2024.

## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as utility electric margins and utility gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Utility electric margins are defined as electric revenues less electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses. Utility gas margins are defined as gas revenues less cost of gas sold. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other utility and non-utility revenues, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and taxes other than income tax expense.

Management believes that utility electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses and cost of gas sold are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to electric and gas revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses. The presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. These utility electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities define utility electric and gas margin. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.

Additionally, the table below includes EPS for Utilities and Corporate Services, ATC Holdings, and Non-utility and Parent, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

Financial Results Overview Alliant Energy's net income and EPS attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for the three months ended September 30 were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

Table of Contents

| | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Income (Loss) | EPS | Income (Loss) | EPS |
| Utilities and Corporate Services | $281 | $1.11 | $249 | $0.99 |
| ATC Holdings | 9 | 0.03 | 5 | 0.02 |
| Non-utility and Parent | (31) | (0.12) | (27) | (0.11) |
| Alliant Energy Consolidated | $259 | $1.02 | $227 | $0.90 |

Alliant Energy's Utilities and Corporate Services net income increased by $32 million for the three-month period, primarily due to higher revenue requirements and AFUDC from WPL's capital investments, and lower other operation and maintenance expenses. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense.

Alliant Energy's Non-utility and Parent net income decreased by $4 million for the three-month period, primarily due to higher interest expense.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, operating income and a reconciliation of utility electric and gas margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, was as follows (in millions):

Electric Sales for Resale Electric sales for resale volume changes were largely due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by MISO. These changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of Alliant Energy's EGUs and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. Changes in sales for resale revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on electric margins.

Gas Transportation/Other Gas transportation/other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in the gas volumes supplied to Alliant Energy's natural gasfired EGUs caused by the availability and dispatch of such EGUs. Changes in these transportation/other revenues did not have a significant impact on gas margins.

Income Taxes - Refer to Note 9 for details of effective income tax rates.

Other Future Considerations - In addition to items discussed in this report, the following key items could impact Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's future financial condition or results of operations:

- · Financing Plans - Alliant Energy currently expects to issue up to $225 million of common stock in 2024 through one or more offerings and its Shareowner Direct Plan. The amount of common stock issued in 2024 will largely be used to fund capital contributions from Alliant Energy to WPL, which is dependent on the PSCW's decision on WPL's common equity component of its capital structure for the 2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period. IPL and AEF currently expect to issue up to $700 million and $1.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively, by the end of 2024. IPL and AEF have $500 million and $400 million of long-term debt, respectively, and AEF has $50 million of short-term borrowings, maturing in 2024.
- · Common Stock Dividends - Alliant Energy announced a 6% increase in its expected targeted 2024 annual common stock dividend to $1.92 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.48 per share, beginning with the February 2024 dividend payment. The timing and amount of future dividends is subject to approved quarterly dividend declarations from Alliant Energy's Board of Directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors.
- · Cash Flows From Operating Activities Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in future cash flows from operating activities resulting from the transfer of future renewable tax credits to other corporate taxpayers pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
- · Higher Earnings on Increasing Rate Base - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in earnings in 2024 compared to 2023 due to impacts from increasing revenue requirements related to investments in the utility business.
- · Depreciation and Amortization Expense - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2024 compared to 2023 due to capital projects placed in service in 2023 and 2024 and lower amortization of WPL's West Riverside liquidated damages. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of WPL's West Riverside liquidated damages.
- · Interest Expense - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 due to financings completed in 2023 and planned by the end of 2024 as discussed above, as well as expected higher interest rates.
- · AFUDC - Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect a decrease and IPL currently expects an increase in AFUDC in 2024 compared to 2023 largely due to changes in construction work in progress balances related to construction activity on capital projects.

Financing Activities The following items contributed to increased (decreased) financing activity cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 (in millions):

| | Alliant Energy | IPL | WPL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Higher net proceeds from common stock issuances | $182 | $- | $- |

| Other | 45 | 12 | 29 |
| | $94 | $398 | ($376) |

State Regulatory Financing Authorization - In March 2023, WPL received authorization from the PSCW to have up to $500 million of short-term borrowings and/or letters of credit outstanding at any time through the expiration date of WPL's credit facility agreement.

Common Stock Issuances and Common Stock Dividends - Refer to Note 6 for discussion of common stock issuances by Alliant Energy in 2023. Refer to " Results of Operations " for discussion of expected issuances of common stock and common stock dividends in 2024.

Short-term Debt - Refer to Note 7(a) for discussion of Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's single credit facility agreement that was amended and extended in March 2023, which includes a revised cross-default provision related to prepayment of material debt prior to the stated maturity and certain other confirming changes, as well as details for proceeds from AEF's December 2022 term loan credit agreement.

Long-term Debt - Refer to Note 7(b) for discussion of various issuances and retirements of long-term debt by Alliant Energy, AEF, IPL and WPL in 2023. Refer to " Results of Operations " for discussion of expected future issuances and retirements of long-term debt by the end of 2024.

Interest Rate Risk - As of September 30, 2023, Alliant Energy's exposure to risk resulting from changes in interest rates associated with variable-rate borrowings was mitigated primarily due to its issuance of convertible senior notes and an interest rate swap on a portion of its variable-rate term loan borrowings, as well as WPL's issuance of green bonds and IPL's issuance of senior debentures, all of which were executed in 2023. Assuming the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings and cash amounts outstanding under IPL's sales of accounts receivable program at September 30, 2023, Alliant Energy's annual pre-tax expense would increase by approximately $6 million.

## Table of Contents

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Certain Financial CommitmentsA summary of Alliant Energy's and IPL's off-balance sheet arrangements and Alliant Energy's, IPL's and WPL's contractual obligations is included in the 2022 Form 10-K and has not changed materially from the items reported in the 2022 Form 10-K , except for the items described in Notes 4 , 7 and 13 .

## OTHER MATTERS

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The summary of critical accounting policies and estimates included in the 2022 Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below.

## Long-Lived Assets -

Regulated Operations -

Generating Units Subject to Early Retirement - In May 2023, IPL retired the Lansing Generating Station. IPL is currently allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this EGU from both its retail and wholesale customers, and as a result, Alliant Energy and IPL concluded that no impairment was required as of September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Lansing retirement.

IPL's Solar Generation Projects Under Construction - As discussed in " 2023 Highlights ," IPL accepted the IUB's advance rate-making principles approved in October 2023 for 400 MW of solar generation. Alliant Energy and IPL review property, plant and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. If IPL is disallowed recovery of any portion of, or is only allowed a partial return on, the carrying value of the solar generation projects under construction, then an impairment charge is recognized. IPL currently expects estimated construction costs associated with the 400 MW of new solar generation will exceed the cost target approved by the IUB by approximately 10%. Alliant Energy and IPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of September 30, 2023 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred.

Environmental Matters The summary of environmental matters included in the 2022 Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below.

## Environmental Regulation -

Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 111(d) - In May 2023, the EPA published proposed standards under Section 111(d) of the CAA, which establish emission guidelines for states to implement Best System of Emission Reduction standards for greenhouse gases emissions from existing fossil-fueled EGUs and certain combustion turbines, and would be phased in beginning in 2030. The EPA also proposed to repeal the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The EPA's proposed standards would require states to implement plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled EGUs and certain combustion turbines through various measures, including retirement, enforceable limits on operational capacity, co-firing with low-greenhouse gases fuels, or other technological controls. State plans must be submitted within 24 months of the final rule's effective date and are subject to EPA approval. The proposed standards could impact IPL's coal-fired Ottumwa Generating Station, George Neal Generating Station, Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 3 and Louisa Generating Station, and IPL's natural gas-fired Burlington Generating Station and Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 4. In addition, the proposed standards could impact natural gas-fired combustion turbines with a capacity of 300 MW or more, including IPL's Marshalltown Generating Station and Emery Generating Station, and WPL's Riverside Energy Center and West Riverside Energy Center. The proposed standards are currently not expected to impact WPL's coal-fired Columbia Energy Center or Edgewater Generating Station given current plans to retire these EGUs prior to the proposed 2030 implementation deadline. The timeline for expected issuance of the EPA's final reconsidered 111(d) rule cannot be predicted with certainty, but is expected to be issued in 2024. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters.

Clean Air Act Section 111(b) - In May 2023, the EPA published proposed standards under Section 111(b) of the CAA, which establish carbon dioxide emissions limits from certain new and reconstructed fossil-fueled EGUs and would apply prospectively. The timeline for expected issuance of the EPA's final reconsidered 111(b) rule cannot be predicted with certainty, but is expected to be issued in 2024. Marshalltown and West Riverside are currently subject to the EPA's Section 111(b) regulation. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these standards.

Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule - In May 2023, the EPA published proposed amendments to the CCR Rule, which regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste. These proposed amendments would expand the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, including some IPL and WPL facilities. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these updates.

Environmental Stewardship Alliant Energy's current voluntary environmental-related goals include the following:

- · By 2030, reduce greenhouse gases emissions from its utility operations by 50% from 2005 levels, reduce its electric utility water supply by 75% from 2005 levels and electrify 100% of its owned light-duty fleet vehicles.
- · By 2040, eliminate all coal-fired EGUs from its generating fleet and reduce greenhouse gases emissions from its utility operations by 80% from 2005 levels.
- · By 2050, aspire to achieve net-zero greenhouse gases emissions from its utility operations.

Alliant Energy's aspirational greenhouse gases goal includes EPA reportable emissions based on applicable regulatory compliance requirements for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from its owned fossil-fueled EGUs and distribution of natural gas. In addition, Alliant Energy's environmental stewardship efforts include a goal to partner to plant more than 1 million trees by the end of 2030. Future updates to sustainable energy plans and attaining these goals will depend on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in Alliant Energy's service territories.

## PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

None. SEC regulations require Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to disclose information about certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL reasonably believe will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL use a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period.
