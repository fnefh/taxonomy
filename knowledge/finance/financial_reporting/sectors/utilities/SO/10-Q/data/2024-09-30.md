CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning regulated
rates, the strategic goals for the business, customer and sales growth, economic conditions, including inflation, cost recovery and other rate actions, current and proposed
environmental regulations and related compliance plans and estimated expenditures, pending or potential litigation matters, access to sources of capital, financing
activities, completion dates and costs of construction projects, matters related to the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, completion of announced acquisitions, filings
with state and federal regulatory authorities, and estimated construction plans and expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential," or "continue"
or the negative of these terms or other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the
forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

*   the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory changes, including tax, environmental, and other laws and regulations to which Southern Company
    and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations;
*   the extent and timing of costs and legal requirements related to CCR;
*   current and future litigation or regulatory investigations, proceedings, or inquiries, including litigation and other disputes related to the Kemper County energy
    facility and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4;
*   the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate, including from the
    development and deployment of alternative energy sources;
*   variations in demand for electricity and natural gas;
*   available sources and costs of natural gas and other fuels and commodities;
*   the ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects, limits on pipeline capacity, public and policymaker support for such
    projects, and operational interruptions to natural gas distribution and transmission activities;
*   transmission constraints;
*   the ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of facilities or other projects due to
    challenges which include, but are not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors;
    subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor
    or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements;
    operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related
    thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or
    operational performance; challenges related to pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological
    conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a
    result of project delays;
*   legal proceedings and regulatory approvals and actions related to past, ongoing, and proposed construction projects, including PSC approvals and FERC and NRC
    actions;
*   the ability to construct facilities in accordance with the requirements of permits and licenses, to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the
    requirements of tax credits and other incentives, and to integrate facilities into the Southern Company system upon completion of construction;
*   investment performance of the employee and retiree benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds;
*   advances in technology, including the pace and extent of development of low- to no-carbon energy and battery energy storage technologies and negative carbon
    concepts;
*   performance of counterparties under ongoing renewable energy partnerships and development agreements;
*   state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations, including rate actions relating to ROE, equity ratios, additional
    generating capacity, and fuel and other cost recovery mechanisms;
*   the ability to successfully operate the traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, Southern Power's
    generation and battery energy storage facilities, and Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage facilities and the successful performance of
    necessary corporate functions;
*   the inherent risks involved in operating nuclear generating facilities;

(continued)
*   the inherent risks involved in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and transportation and storage of natural gas, including accidents,
explosions, fires, mechanical problems, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and other environmental risks;
*   the performance of projects undertaken by the non-utility businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities;
*   internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(A) INTRODUCTION
The condensed quarterly financial statements of each Registrant included herein have been prepared by such Registrant, without audit, pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Condensed Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 have been derived from the audited financial
statements of each Registrant. In the opinion of each Registrant's management, the information regarding such Registrant furnished herein reflects
all adjustments, which, except as otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each Registrant believes that the
disclosures regarding such Registrant are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Disclosures which would substantially
duplicate the disclosures in the Form 10-K and details which have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the filing of the Form
10-K are generally omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q unless specifically required by GAAP. Therefore, these Condensed
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. Due to the
seasonal variations in the demand for energy and other factors, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results to be expected for the full year.
Certain prior year data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on the overall results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any Registrant.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
In the third quarter 2024, Alabama Power discontinued the development of a multi-use commercial facility. Given the decision to discontinue
commercial development, Alabama Power performed an impairment test using a comparative market analysis and determined the carrying amount
of the asset exceeded its fair value, net of selling costs. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment loss of $36 million ($27 million after tax) reflected in
other operations and maintenance on the statements of income.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Goodwill</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>(in millions)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company</td>
    <td>$ 5,161</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company Gas:</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gas distribution operations</td>
    <td>$ 4,034</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gas marketing services</td>
    <td>981</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company Gas total</td>
    <td>$ 5,015</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if goodwill
impairment indicators exist.

Natural Gas for Sale

With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. For any declines in market prices
below the WACOG considered to be other than temporary, an adjustment is recorded to reduce the value of natural gas inventories to market
value. Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to
year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end
are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated.

Southern Company Gas recorded no material adjustments to natural gas inventories for either period presented. Nicor Gas' inventory decrement at
September 30, 2024 is expected to be restored prior to year-end.

See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Following initial criticality for Plant Vogtle Unit 4 on February 14, 2024, Georgia Power recorded AROs of approximately $ 118 million. See Note (B) under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
In September 2024, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 through 4. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in a decrease in Georgia Power's ARO liability of $389 million. See "Nuclear Decommissioning" herein for additional information.

Nuclear Decommissioning
See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K under "Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information. Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The decommissioning cost estimates are based on removal of the plant from service and prompt dismantlement. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making these estimates.

(*) Based on Georgia Power's ownership interests.

For ratemaking purposes, Georgia Power's decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive
portion of the facilities and the site study estimate for spent fuel management. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for
ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of 2.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 2.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an
estimated trust earnings rate of 4.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 4.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Effective May 1, 2024, as
approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant Vogtle Unit 4.

Alabama Power

Rate ECR

On May 8, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to lower Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. The approved decrease in the Rate ECR factor will have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income but will decrease operating cash flows. The rate will adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in January 2026 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.

Reliability Reserve Accounting Order

On September 18, 2024, Alabama Power notified the Alabama PSC of its intent to use a portion of its $ 143 million reliability reserve balance during 2024. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

(UNAUDITED)
Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity
On October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total
purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates Lindsay
Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024,
Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the
acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station.
As part of the acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility
remains committed to a third party through April 2027. Upon expiration of the power sales agreement, Alabama Power expects to recover costs
associated with the Lindsay Hill Generating Station acquisition through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.
The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions,
approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 to the financial statements under
"Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Mississippi Power's 2024 IRP includes a schedule to retire Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 by
the end of 2028.
Alabama Power currently expects to retire Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (300 MWs based on 60% ownership) by the end of 2028. Alabama
Power and Mississippi Power continue to evaluate operating conditions and business needs relevant to the anticipated retirement of Plant Greene
County Units 1 and 2.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" herein for additional
information.
Georgia Power

(UNAUDITED)
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulation among Georgia
Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors. In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable
costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. In doing so, the Georgia PSC
recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in
which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of the additional costs.
Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.
Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December
2028.
•
Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems collocated with existing
Georgia Power-owned solar facilities, on which the Georgia PSC is expected to render a decision establishing certified amounts in the fourth
quarter 2024, as well as the issuance of a request for proposals for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities.
Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.
On January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction with Mitsubishi Power Americas,
Inc. and Black & Veatch Construction, Inc. to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Yates (Plant Yates Units 8,
9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.
In the third quarter 2024, Georgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage
facilities totaling 500 MWs and a 265-MW battery energy storage facility, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026, as authorized in the
2023 IRP Update and 2022 IRP, respectively.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Transmission Asset Sales
On March 7, 2024, the FERC approved the sale of transmission line assets under the integrated transmission system agreement, with a net book
value of $236 million. On April 24, 2024, the sale, with a purchase price of $ 351 million, was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of
approximately $114 million ($84 million after tax) recorded in the second quarter 2024.
Storm Damage Recovery
Georgia Power is recovering $31 million annually under the 2022 ARP for incremental operating and maintenance costs of damage from major
storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. During September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant damage to Georgia Power's
transmission and distribution facilities. The initial estimated incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset
for storm damage totaled approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the amounts included in the storm damage reserve will be capitalized to
property, plant, and equipment once the nature of storm restoration costs is fully assessed. At September 30, 2024, Georgia Power's regulatory
asset balance related to storm damage was $1.2 billion. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the next base
rate case and in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have
a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's net income but do impact the related operating cash flows.

Nuclear Construction
Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power placed Unit 3 and Unit 4 in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. During the second quarter 2024, following
Unit 4's in-service date, Southern Nuclear evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations and reduced
the remaining estimate to complete forecast by approximately $21 million. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of
approximately $21 million ($16 million after tax) in the second quarter 2024 to recognize capital costs previously charged to income.
Georgia Power's net capital costs incurred through September 30, 2024 in connection with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and its approximate
proportionate share of additional capital costs to be incurred after September 30, 2024, including completion of site demobilization and remaining

(a) Includes approximately $1.2 billion of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners. Excludes financing costs capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $440 million
accrued through Unit 4's in-service date.
(b) Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power's financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaled approximately $ 3.53 billion, of which $3.08 billion had
been recovered through Unit 4's in-service date.
Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit
3. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the common facilities construction costs continued to be
recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the
remaining depreciation expense until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component
of financing costs and depreciation expense are being recovered over 10 years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC, with a
remaining balance of $24 million and $30 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The equity component of financing costs ($ 40 million at
September 30, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be
recognized in Georgia Power's statements of income in the periods it is billable to customers.
After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $ 2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for
Unit 3 and common facilities, Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as
$647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency
Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately
5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Reductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately
$310 million in 2023 and $ 80 million through the second quarter 2024. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since
commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate
AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024, which resulted in a negative impact to earnings of approximately $ 10 million (for one
month) in the second quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 in-service date. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4,
Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and related financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general retail revenue requirements.

Mississippi Power
Performance Evaluation Plan
On June 13, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2024 with no change in retail rates.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
On May 7, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ECO Plan filing for 2024, resulting in an $ 8 million annual increase in
revenues effective with the first billing cycle of June 2024.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
On June 13, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2024, resulting in a $ 5 million
annual decrease in revenues effective with the first billing cycle of July 2024. This decrease is not expected to have a significant effect on
Mississippi Power's net income but will affect operating cash flows.
System Restoration Rider
On April 11, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which indicated no change in retail rates. Mississippi
Power's minimum annual SRR accrual was increased from $12 million to $13 million.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the
review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene
County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50% ownership), all
by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia Power.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $ 476 million at September 30, 2024, and Mississippi Power is
continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at
retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with a
2020 Mississippi PSC order. The Plant Watson and Plant Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund, and
establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company Gas
Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
On June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the
program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with

a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over the five-year extension of $355 million.
Rate Proceedings
Atlanta Gas Light
On July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's triennial Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, filed
on February 1, 2024, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related
revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the
Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of
Transportation (GDOT) infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge, if approved, will be based on requests filed annually
on September 1, with new rates to become effective January 1 of the following year. Finally, the stipulation requires Atlanta Gas Light to include
an alternate rate plan for the three-year period of 2025 through 2027 with its 2025 GRAM filing.
On July 31, 2024, Atlanta Gas Light submitted its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC, which includes projections for portions of the
System Reinforcement Rider and municipal, county, and GDOT projects. The filing requests a traditional annual base rate increase of $120 million
based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025. In accordance with the approved Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing,
Atlanta Gas Light also included two alternative annual base rate increases for 2025 that provide for lower increases in 2025 with subsequent
increases in 2026 and 2027. Resolution of the GRAM filing is expected by December 31, 2024, with new rates effective January 1, 2025. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
On August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of
$63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and
increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January
1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments will be effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia
Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the third quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
(C) CONTINGENCIES
See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits and other contingencies.
General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation
or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings not
specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have
a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants intend to dispute the allegations raised in and vigorously defend against the pending legal challenges discussed below; however,
the ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company and Mississippi Power
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $ 270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the
grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round
53

(UNAUDITED)
2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of $ 137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power
filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. In 2020,
Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled
Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with
the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of a
civil investigation related to the DOE grants. In August 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia unsealed a civil action in
which defendants Southern Company, SCS, and Mississippi Power are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the False Claims Act by
fraudulently inducing the DOE to disburse funds pursuant to the grants. The federal government declined to intervene in the action. In October
2023, the plaintiff, a former SCS employee, filed an amended complaint, again alleging certain violations of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff
seeks to recover all damages incurred personally and on behalf of the federal government caused by the defendants' alleged violations, as well as
treble damages and attorneys' fees, among other relief. On February 2, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On August
28, 2024, the court granted the defendants' motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing the plaintiff's False Claims Act count along with its
accompanying treble damages and attorneys' fees but allowing the employment retaliation claim to proceed. The plaintiff requested interlocutory
appeal of the court's decision on October 4, 2024. On October 14, 2024, the defendants asserted counterclaims for conversion and
misappropriation of trade secrets. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial
statements.
Alabama Power
In September 2022, Mobile Baykeeper filed a citizen suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama alleging that Alabama
Power's plan to close the Plant Barry surface impoundment utilizing a closure-in-place methodology violates the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) and regulations governing CCR. Among other relief requested, Mobile Baykeeper sought a declaratory judgment that the
RCRA and regulations governing CCR were being violated, preliminary and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of Alabama Power's
closure plan, and the development of a closure plan that satisfies regulations governing CCR requirements. In December 2022, Alabama Power
filed a motion to dismiss the case. On January 4, 2024, the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice by the U.S. District Court judge. On February
1, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied by the U.S. District Court judge on July 22, 2024. On August 20, 2024, the
plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit challenging the denial of the motion to reconsider the order
of dismissal.
In January 2023, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violations (NOPV) associated with Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry surface
impoundment. On September 26, 2024, Alabama Power reached a settlement with the EPA resolving two of the three allegations in the NOPV
related to the groundwater monitoring system and the emergency action plan at the Plant Barry surface impoundment. Alabama Power has
affirmed to the EPA its position that it is in compliance with CCR requirements.
These matters could have a material impact on Alabama Power's financial statements, including ARO estimates and cash flows. See Note 6 to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of Alabama Power's ARO liabilities.
Georgia Power
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint, which was amended in December 2022, in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer has impacted groundwater and air, resulting in
alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a
medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. In December 2022, the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia granted Georgia Power's motion
to transfer the case to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia. In May 2023, the Superior Court of
54

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
Monroe County, Georgia denied Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In July 2023, the Superior
Court of Monroe County, Georgia denied the remaining motions to dismiss certain claims and plaintiffs that Georgia Power filed at the outset of
the case. On March 11, 2024, Georgia Power filed a motion to dismiss certain claims. On March 14, 2024, Georgia Power filed motions for
summary judgment. In May 2024, Georgia Power filed additional motions for summary judgment. In August 2024, the court denied certain
motions for summary judgment, while granting other motions for summary judgment, eliminating some claims from the first one-plaintiff trial.
In October 2021, February 2022, and January 2023, a total of eight additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries
and property damage. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. After Georgia Power
removed these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without
prejudice in November 2022 and January 2023. In May 2023, the plaintiffs in the cases originally filed in October 2021, February 2022, and
January 2023 refiled their eight complaints in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia. Also in May 2023, a new complaint was filed in the
Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer have impacted
groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including punitive
damages. Also in May 2023, Georgia Power removed all of these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The plaintiffs
are requesting the court remand the cases back to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia.
The amount of possible loss, if any, from these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three then-
serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to
include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon
including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper County energy facility prior to placing the Kemper County
energy facility into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by
customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were
improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid
customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of
themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.
The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of
the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against
all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file
a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state
law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In
November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In
January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In
February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In March 2022, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the
dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. In May 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi
Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings. In
June 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss
55

(UNAUDITED)
the complaint with prejudice, which was granted on March 15, 2023. On March 28, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In December 2023, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing the
plaintiffs' complaint against Mississippi Power, and the plaintiffs filed a petition for panel rehearing, which was denied on January 10, 2024. The
plaintiffs did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. This matter is now concluded.
Southern Power
In 2021, Southern Power and certain of its subsidiaries filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association against First Solar
for defective design of actuators on trackers and inverters installed by First Solar under the engineering, procurement, and construction agreements
associated with five solar projects owned by Southern Power and partners and managed by Southern Power. In 2023, Southern Power received an
award of approximately $36 million and filed for confirmation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Subsequently in 2023, First Solar filed a
motion to dismiss the confirmation and, in February 2024, filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Supreme Court of New York
County, New York. In March 2024, Southern Power dismissed the proceeding in Delaware without prejudice and filed an opposition to First
Solar's petition in the New York matter. On May 6, 2024, the Supreme Court of New York County, New York denied First Solar's petition to
vacate and confirmed the arbitration award. This matter is now concluded.
At September 30, 2024, $ 16 million of the award remains on the balance sheet as restricted cash and as a liability to fund future replacement costs.
See Note (A) under "Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash" for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases
of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up
affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received
authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs
through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or
other applicable state regulatory agencies.
Georgia Power's environmental remediation liability was $ 13 million and $14 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site
Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and potential
cleanup of such sites is expected.
Southern Company Gas' environmental remediation liability was $ 230 million and $222 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known former manufactured gas plant
operating sites. Southern Company Gas has identified one former manufactured gas plant site in North Carolina where environmental
investigation and remediation are possible. Costs associated with this site cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental
remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of the applicable Registrants.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
On June 7, 2024 and August 15, 2024, the Court of Federal Claims entered final judgments on damages in the third and fourth round of lawsuits,
respectively, against the U.S. government awarding Alabama Power a total of $100 million and Georgia Power a total of $ 121 million (based on
its ownership interests), which represent claims for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019. This represents all outstanding
claims.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
At September 30, 2024, Alabama Power recognized both a receivable and a regulatory liability of $ 100 million. Alabama Power expects to credit
recovery for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from the Alabama PSC. At September 30, 2024, Georgia Power recognized a
receivable of $259 million and a payable to the joint owners of Plants Hatch and Vogtle of $ 138 million (based on their ownership interests) and
credited the award to accounts where the original costs were charged, which reduced rate base, fuel, and cost of service for the benefit of
customers, as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC. As a result of this regulatory treatment, there will be no material impact on Southern
Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income.
Other Matters
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
In April 2019, Bellsouth Telecommunications d/b/a AT&T Alabama (AT&T) filed a complaint against Alabama Power with the FCC alleging that
the pole rental rate AT&T is required to pay pursuant to the parties' joint use agreement is unjust and unreasonable under federal law. The
complaint sought a new rate and approximately $87 million in refunds of alleged overpayments for the preceding six years. In August 2019, the
FCC stayed the case in favor of arbitration, which AT&T has not pursued. The joint use agreement remains in effect. The ultimate outcome of this
matter cannot be determined at this time, but an adverse outcome could have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company
and Alabama Power. Georgia Power and Mississippi Power have joint use agreements with other AT&T affiliates.
(D) REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND LEASE INCOME
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources, some of which are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers, such
as leases, derivatives, and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Included in the wholesale electric revenues of the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power are revenues associated with affiliate transactions. These revenues are generated through long-term PPAs or short-
term energy sales made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Amounts related to these affiliate revenues are eliminated in
consolidation for Southern Company. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenues" and "Affiliate Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K for additional information. See "Lease Income" herein and Note (J) for additional information on revenue accounted for under lease and
derivative accounting guidance, respectively.

Contract assets for Georgia Power primarily relate to retail customer fixed bill programs, where the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's
continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service
agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract liabilities for Georgia Power primarily relate to cash collections
recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements. Southern Company Gas' contract assets relate to work performed on an
energy efficiency enhancement and upgrade contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. Southern Company Gas receives cash
advances from a third-party financial institution to fund work performed, of which approximately $68 million had been received at September 30,
2024. These advances have been accounted for as long-term debt on the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Affiliate
Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the construction contract. At September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $102 million and $91 million, respectively, and
contract liabilities of $132 million and $115 million, respectively, for outstanding performance obligations, all of which are expected to be
satisfied within one year.

Revenues recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023,
were $20 million and $97 million, respectively, for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants. Contract liabilities are primarily
classified as current on the balance sheets as the corresponding revenues are generally expected to be recognized within one year.

Remaining Performance Obligations
Southern Company's subsidiaries may enter into long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations
are satisfied over the contract term. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily relate to PPAS
whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable;
however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, these
contracts primarily relate to the U.S. General Services Administration contract described above. Southern Company's unregulated distributed
generation business also has partially satisfied performance

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
(E) CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Southern Company
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $ 127 million and $126 million,
respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings from these investments
were immaterial for all periods presented.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIES
because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to
absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Solar had total assets of $ 5.6 billion, total liabilities of $378 million and $399 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to the
limited partner in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without
limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter.
Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Wind had total assets of $ 2.1 billion, total liabilities of $ 184 million and $187 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $36 million and $38 million, respectively. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement,
distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its
members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash
distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited
liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities of each entity,
including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to partner consent and the
liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any
long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax equity investors
or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the arrangements are structured similar
to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out rights.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the other VIEs had total assets of $ 1.7 billion, total liabilities of $240 million and $230 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $710 million and $761 million, respectively. Under the terms of the partnership agreements,
distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional distributions require partner consent.

among other things, extended the maturity date from 2025 to 2027. In May 2024, (i) Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company
Gas Capital, along with Nicor Gas, extended the maturity

dates of certain of their multi-year credit arrangements from 2028 to 2029; (ii) Southern Company and Southern Power extended the maturity date
of their combined multi-year credit arrangement from 2028 to 2029; (iii) Southern Company, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO amended their credit
arrangements aggregating $150 million, $100 million, and $30 million, respectively, which extended the maturity dates from 2024 to 2025; and
(iv) Georgia Power entered into two new credit arrangements aggregating $300 million, which mature in 2025. In June 2024, Mississippi Power
amended certain of its multi-year credit arrangements aggregating $150 million, which extended the maturity dates from 2026 to 2027.
Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit
debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the
indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable
borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At September 30, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO
were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of
borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At September 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate
demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion
(comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition,
at September 30, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue
bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are
classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate
demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the
balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit.
Convertible Senior Notes
In May 2024, Southern Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2024A 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15,
2027 (Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes).
Interest on the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes is payable semiannually, beginning December 15, 2024. The Series 2024A Convertible
Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier converted or repurchased, but are not redeemable at the option of Southern Company.
The Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes are direct, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of Southern Company, ranking equally with all
of Southern Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding, and are effectively subordinated to all
secured indebtedness of Southern Company.
Holders may convert their Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day preceding
March 15, 2027, but only under the following circumstances:
*   during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Southern Company's common stock for at
    least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day as
    determined by Southern Company;

•
during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (Measurement Period) in which the trading price per $1,000
principal amount of Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product
of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or
upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes.
On or after March 15, 2027, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at any time prior to the close of
business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions.
Southern Company will settle conversions of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of
the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a
combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Southern Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Southern Company's
conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes being converted. The Series
2024A Convertible Senior Notes are initially convertible at a rate of 10.8166 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount converted,
which is approximately equal to $92.45 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental
change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), Southern Company will, in certain circumstances,
increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for conversions in connection with the make-whole fundamental
change.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), holders of the
Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes may require Southern Company to purchase all or a portion of their Series 2024A Convertible Senior
Notes, in principal amounts equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series
2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Earnings per Share

For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is attributable to awards outstanding under
stock-based compensation plans and the Series 2023A convertible senior notes and Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes. EPS dilution resulting
from stock-based compensation plans is determined using the treasury stock method, and EPS dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible
senior notes and Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes is determined using the net share settlement method. See "Convertible Senior Notes"
herein and Note 8 to the financial statements under "Convertible Senior Notes" and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K
for additional information. Shares used to compute diluted EPS were as follows:

For all periods presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because the
awards were anti-dilutive.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no dilution resulting from the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes, and
the dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible senior notes was immaterial.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was no dilution resulting from the Series 2023 A convertible senior notes or Series
2024A Convertible Senior Notes.
Georgia Power Lease Modification
See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information on Georgia Power's leases. In June 2024, Georgia Power
recognized a lease modification related to an existing affiliate PPA with Southern Power which converted from an operating lease to a finance
lease upon its approval by the FERC. As a result, Georgia Power removed from its balance sheet operating lease right-of-use assets, net of
amortization of $8 million and lease obligations of $ 10 million maturing through 2025 and recorded finance lease right-of-use assets of
$44 million and lease obligations of $45 million maturing through 2035. See Note (B) under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for
additional information.
(G) INCOME TAXES
See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional tax information.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable
AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal
income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs.
Details of significant changes in the effective tax rate for the applicable Registrants are provided herein.
Southern Company
Southern Company's effective tax rate was 19.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.9% for the corresponding period
in 2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes at Alabama
Power, higher pre-tax earnings, and an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power, partially
offset by an increase in PTCs and the recognition of certain state tax positions from amended returns primarily at Georgia Power. See
"Unrecognized Tax Benefits" herein for additional information.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's effective tax rate was 21.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.3% for the corresponding period in
2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's effective tax rate was 18.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.2% for the corresponding period in
2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state tax
credit carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in PTCs and the recognition of certain state tax positions from amended returns. See
"Unrecognized Tax Benefits" herein for additional information.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's effective tax rate was 20.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.9% for the corresponding period
in 2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Southern Company's and Georgia Power's unrecognized tax position balances at September 30, 2024 were $ 73 million and $34 million,
respectively, compared to $116 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31,

2023. The decreases from prior periods are primarily related to the 2019 and 2020 amended state filing positions related to tax credit utilization
and decreased Southern Company's and Georgia Power's effective tax rates.
(H) RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the exception of
employees at PowerSecure. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending December 31,
2024. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of management and highly
compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other
postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded
supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses.
See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
On each Registrant's condensed statements of income, the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is included in other operations and
maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic benefit costs are included in other income (expense), net. Components of the net
periodic benefit costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following tables.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power
products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market
approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and
overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market
data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected
payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present
value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair
value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's
expectation of future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value
Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note (J) for additional information on how
these derivatives are used.

For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred compensation trusts,
external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held
within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining
the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then
evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather
market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector
news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading
levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.

The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
decommissioning. See Note 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to two of its acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make generation-based
payments to the seller, commencing at the commercial operation of each facility and continuing through 2026 and 2036, respectively. The
obligations are primarily categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using significant unobservable
inputs for the forecasted facility's generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount
rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects the net present value of expected payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted
generation is expected to be immaterial.

Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection facilities and
network upgrades constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating facility to the transmission system. The obligations are
categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using observable inputs for the contracted amounts and
reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects the net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" primarily includes investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized as
Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds, and/or agency bonds.
At September 30, 2024, the fair value measurements of private market investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that
are calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $188 million and unfunded commitments related to the
private market investments totaled $89 million. Private market investments include high-quality private equity funds across several market sectors,
funds that invest in real estate assets, and a private credit fund. Private market funds do not have redemption rights. Distributions from these funds
will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

(*) The carrying amount of Southern Company Gas' long-term debt includes fair value adjustments from the effective date of the 2016 merger with Southern Company. Southern
Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.
The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
rates available to the Registrants.
(J) DERIVATIVES
The Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as
counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not
limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance
sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note (I) for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash
flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled
foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or
principal, respectively. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Energy-Related Derivatives
The Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes.
However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market

volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution
utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other
applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility.
The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market
volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser.
However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity
prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a
volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-
traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the
intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in natural gas revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating
companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered
through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge
anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in accumulated OCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same
period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in
the statements of income as incurred.
Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common
and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative
unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying
goods being delivered.
At September 30, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over
which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

(*) Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a
contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of 118 million mmBtu long natural gas positions and 11 million mmBtu short natural gas positions
at September 30, 2024, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume.

In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply
contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas
subject to such a feature is 13 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 3 million mmBtu for Alabama Power, 5 million mmBtu for
Georgia Power, 2 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 3 million mmBtu for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax losses expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings for
the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 are immaterial for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives
related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or
losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item as the
earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income
statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of
income as incurred.

For cash flow hedges of interest rate derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains and (losses) expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to
interest expense for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 are $(14) million for Southern Company and immaterial for the traditional
electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas. Deferred gains and losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be
amortized into earnings through 2054 for Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, 2052 for Alabama Power, and 2046 for
Southern Company Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives
related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions,

including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate
securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are
both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the
U.S. currency exchange rates. Southern Company has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in
the fair value hedges of its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and
the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of OCI.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts

The Registrants enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and
payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master
netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting across product
lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are presented net to the extent that
there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

Pre-tax gains on energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were $ 6 million and $69 million for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $7 million and $36 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,
and reflected in cost of natural gas on the statements of income of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and were immaterial for the
other Registrants for all periods presented.

Contingent Features
The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit
rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit,
or cash. At September 30, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

For Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and
the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
$61 million at September 30, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
immaterial at September 30, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with
contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below
BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at September 30, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related
contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.

Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative
transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin
requirements. At September 30, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern
Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on
the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into
these accounts. At September 30, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $22 million.

The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally
enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that

have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in
order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to
post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or
letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to
entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the
counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas
may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable
Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting
and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded
on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

**Southern Company**

The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power
and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities
providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets,
including renewable energy and battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern
Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses
including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services.

Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity
in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern
Company Gas. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $102 million and $280 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and $156 million and $406 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies
and Southern Power were immaterial for all periods presented. The "All Other" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does
not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial,
governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas
marketing services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other.

Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that
construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.

Gas pipeline investments consist of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership
interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of
Southern Company Gas. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

Gas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar.

The "All other" column includes segments and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage and
fuels operations. The "All other" column included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to
the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies (Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The
primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and
the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional
electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other
complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas' reportable segments are gas distribution operations,
gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services. See Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information on
segment reporting. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially
all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the
sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market. For additional information on the Registrants' primary business activities, see BUSINESS
- "The Southern Company System" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K.
The Registrants continue to focus on several key performance indicators. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company
Gas, these indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and
execution of major construction projects. Southern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree
Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating
Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system.
For Southern Power, key performance indicators include, but are not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to
evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers. In addition, Southern Company and the
Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator.
Recent Developments
Alabama Power
On May 8, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to lower Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or
approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings.
On October 24, 2024, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. for a total
purchase price of approximately $622 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Tenaska Alabama Partners, L.P. owns and operates Lindsay
Hill Generating Station, an approximately 855-MW combined cycle generation facility, in Autauga County, Alabama. On October 30, 2024,
Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the
acquisition of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station. Alabama Power expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the third quarter 2025.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Alabama Power" herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status
Georgia Power placed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. During the second quarter 2024,
following Unit 4's in-service date, Southern Nuclear evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations
and reduced the remaining estimate to complete forecast by approximately $21 million. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to
income of approximately $21 million ($16 million after tax) in the second quarter 2024 to recognize capital costs previously charged to income.
Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast, including completion of site

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
demobilization and remaining contractor obligations, is $10.7 billion. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power
Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule" herein for additional information.
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power included in retail rate base $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base
items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues
increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR
tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia
Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024,
following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters" herein for additional
information.
Rate Plans
In accordance with the terms of the 2022 ARP, on October 1, 2024, Georgia Power filed tariff adjustments to become effective January 1, 2025
that would result in a net increase in rates of $306 million pending approval by the Georgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Rate Plans" herein for additional
information.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulation among Georgia
Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors. The 2023 IRP Update includes the authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400
MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was
approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated
Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Mississippi Power
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the
review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene
County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50% ownership), all
by the end of 2028.
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund, and
establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Mississippi Power" herein for additional information.
Southern Power
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 150-MW South
Cheyenne solar facility. In addition, Southern Power continued construction of the 200-MW first phase, the 180-MW second phase, and the 90-
MW third phase of the Millers Branch solar facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Southern Power committed to expand construction of the
third phase of the

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Millers Branch solar project by 42 MWs of capacity, substantially all of which is contracted under a 15-year PPA, and commercial operation is
projected to occur in the fourth quarter 2026. With the expansion of the third phase, the Millers Branch solar project will have a total generating
capacity of 512 MWs. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
At September 30, 2024, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various
partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service
value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount was 97% through 2028 and 89% through 2033, with an average remaining
contract duration of approximately 12 years.
Southern Company Gas
Atlanta Gas Light
On July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's triennial Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, filed
on February 1, 2024, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related
revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the
Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of
Transportation (GDOT) infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge, if approved, will be based on requests filed annually
on September 1, with new rates to become effective January 1 of the following year. Finally, the stipulation requires Atlanta Gas Light to include
an alternate rate plan for the three-year period of 2025 through 2027 with its 2025 GRAM filing.
On July 31, 2024, Atlanta Gas Light submitted its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC, which includes projections for portions of the
System Reinforcement Rider and municipal, county, and GDOT projects. The filing requests a traditional annual base rate increase of
$120 million. In accordance with the approved Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, Atlanta Gas Light also included two alternative
annual base rate increases for 2025 that provide for lower increases in 2025 with subsequent increases in 2026 and 2027. Resolution of the GRAM
filing is expected by December 31, 2024, with new rates effective January 1, 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
On June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the
program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the
program, for a maximum total investment over the five-year extension of $355 million.
On August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of
$63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased
costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an
ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments will be effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is
expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the third quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company
Net Income

| | Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 | Year-To-Date 2024 vs. Year-To-Date 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | (change in millions) | (% change) | (change in millions) | (% change) |
| | $113 | 7.9 | $746 | 23.9 |

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $1.5 billion ($1.40 per share) in the third quarter 2024 compared to $1.4 billion
($1.30 per share) for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was
$3.9 billion ($3.53 per share) compared to $3.1 billion ($2.86 per share) for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to
increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing, an after-tax charge of $120 million in the third quarter 2023 related to the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and increases in other revenues, partially offset by increases in interest expense, non-fuel operations
and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales. Also contributing to the year-to-
date 2024 increase was an increase in retail electric revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2024 and warmer weather in the
second quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 and an increase in natural gas revenues from rate increases.
Retail Electric Revenues
In the third quarter 2024, retail electric revenues were $5.4 billion compared to $5.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, retail electric revenues were $13.8 billion compared to $12.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail
electric revenues were as follows:

| | Third Quarter 2024 vs. | | Year-To-Date 2024 vs. | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Third Quarter 2023 | | Year-To-Date 2023 | |
| | (change in millions) | (% change) | (change in millions) | (% change) |
| Rates and pricing | $ 458 | 8.9% | $ 1,051 | 8.3% |
| Sales growth (decline) | (39) | (0.8) | 24 | 0.2 |
| Weather | (15) | (0.3) | 279 | 2.2 |
| Fuel and other cost recovery | (177) | (3.4) | (158) | (1.2) |
| Retail electric revenues | $ 227 | 4.4% | $ 1,196 | 9.5% |

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023 primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff at Georgia
Power, customer bill credits in 2023 at Alabama Power related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes, base tariff
increases at Georgia Power in accordance with its 2022 ARP, higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable
demand-driven pricing at Georgia Power, and an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues at Alabama Power. See Note (B) to the Condensed
Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter 2024 and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.5% and 0.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024,
respectively, primarily due to decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased
0.1% in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to customer growth, largely offset by decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH
sales increased 2.1% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increased customer usage, primarily driven by existing
96

data centers, and customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.4% and 0.3% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively,
primarily due to increases in the pipeline, chemicals, and transportation sectors.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased $177 million and $158 million in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared
to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to lower recoverable fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rates for the traditional electric
operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs.
Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income.
The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other
compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note
(B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale electric revenues were $721 million compared to $727 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-
to-date 2024, wholesale electric revenues were $1.92 billion compared to $1.93 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases in the
third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were due to decreases in energy revenues of $38 million and $36 million, respectively, partially offset by
increases in capacity revenues of $32 million and $25 million, respectively. The decreases in energy revenues were primarily due to decreases
related to the average net cost of fuel and purchased power. Partially offsetting the year-to-date 2024 decrease in energy revenues was an increase
in the volume of KWHs sold under natural gas and solar PPAs at Southern Power. The increases in capacity revenues were primarily due to a net
increase in revenues from capacity contracts at Georgia Power and an increase in capacity revenues associated with natural gas PPAs at Southern
Power. The changes for year-to-date 2024 in capacity and energy revenues also reflect decreases resulting from power sales agreements that
ended in May 2023 at Alabama Power.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than
solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income
and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market
prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's
electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are
driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales
from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility
through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and
maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions,
equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated
municipal and rural association sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.

| | (change in millions) | (% change) | | (change in millions) | (% change) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | $19 | 9.4 | | $29 | 4.8 |

In the third quarter 2024, other electric revenues were $222 million compared to $203 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase
was primarily due to increases of $15 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, $8 million
in pole attachment revenues at Georgia Power, and $6 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, partially offset by a decrease
of $7 million due to an arbitration award received in 2023 at Southern Power and a net increase of $7 million in realized losses associated with
price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at Georgia Power.
For year-to-date 2024, other electric revenues were $631 million compared to $602 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase
was primarily due to increases of $34 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, $17 million
in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, and $10 million in customer fees primarily at Georgia Power, partially offset by a net
increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at
Georgia Power and a decrease of $14 million related to liquidated damages receipts associated with generation facility production guarantees and
an arbitration award in 2023 at Southern Power.
Natural Gas Revenues
In the third quarter 2024, natural gas revenues were $682 million compared to $689 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, natural gas revenues were $3.2 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in natural gas
revenues were as follows:

| Other | | (15) | (2.2) | | (43) | (1.3) |
| Natural gas revenues | | $ (7) | (1.0)% | | $ (197) | (5.8)% |

Revenues from rate changes increased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to rate increases,
partially offset by a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Rate
Proceedings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to
lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather. Natural gas
distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas
revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
Revenues from gas marketing services decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower
commodity prices.

2024, other revenues were $820 million compared to $662 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases in the third quarter and
year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of $49 million and $97 million, respectively, at PowerSecure primarily related to distributed
infrastructure projects and $14 million and $36 million, respectively, in unregulated sales at Georgia Power associated with power delivery
construction and maintenance projects, partially offset by decreases of $7 million and $19 million, respectively, at Southern Linc primarily related
to equipment sales associated with commercial customers. Also contributing to the year-to-date 2024 increase were increases of $14 million in
unregulated sales at Georgia Power associated with energy conservation projects and renewables and $10 million in unregulated sales associated
with outdoor lighting at the traditional electric operating companies.

In the third quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.4 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $111 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an $8 million net
decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. Also contributing to the decrease was a $60 million credit to nuclear fuel
expense at Georgia Power resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs.
For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.8 billion compared to $4.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to a $174 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a $21
million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. Also contributing to the decrease was a $60 million credit to nuclear
fuel expense at Georgia Power resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs.
See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" herein for additional information.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have
a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.

Fuel

In the third quarter 2024, fuel expense was $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to an 11.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, a 9.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a
7.5% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, partially offset by a 15.2% increase in the average cost per KWH generated by
nuclear, a 12.9% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, and an 11.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro. Also
contributing to the third quarter 2024 decrease was $60 million of credits recorded to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to
nuclear fuel disposal costs at Georgia Power.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $3.2 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to a 9.1% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, a 5.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas,
and a 1.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 17.6% increase in the average cost per KWH generated
by nuclear, a 15.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, a 15.3% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, and a
7.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal. Also contributing to the year-to-date 2024 decrease was $60 million of credits recorded
to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs at Georgia Power.

Purchased Power
In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense was $249 million compared to $207 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
increase was primarily due to an increase of 8.9% in the volume of KWHs purchased and an increase of 1.5% in the average cost per KWH
purchased.
For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense was $669 million compared to $680 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease
was primarily due to a decrease of 7.1% in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by an increase of 2.2% in the average cost per KWH
purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of
wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's
generation.

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities' rates include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount
expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas - Natural Gas Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural
gas distribution utilities represented 77% and 81% of the total cost of natural gas in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively.
For year-to-date 2024, cost of natural gas was $0.9 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease reflects
lower gas cost recovery as a result of a decrease of 22% in natural gas prices.

due to a decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.4% in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to a
decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.7% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to customer growth.
Industrial KWH sales increased 0.6% and 0.1% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the pipeline
and forest products sectors.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023
primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs
associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and
do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $89 million compared to $106 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 12.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of lower market demand.
For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $259 million compared to $358 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 41.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May
2023, partially offset by a 23.3% increase in the price of energy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also
included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above
Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were $34 million compared to $14 million for the corresponding period in
2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were $103 million compared to $43 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The increases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 178.8% and 188.4%, respectively, in the
volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy
revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

In the third quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $481 million compared to $524 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to a $34 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $9 million net decrease
related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was due to a $45 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $26 million net decrease related
to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate ECR" in

(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.

Fuel
In the third quarter 2024, fuel expense was $384 million compared to $402 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to a 15.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, and a 13.8%
decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, partially offset by a 37.5% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas and an
18.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $1.1 billion compared to $1.0 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily
due to a 35.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas and an 18.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro
facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by an 11.1% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which excludes
tolling agreements.

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $49 million compared to $42 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 4.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Alabama Power and other Southern Company
system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources.

For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $148 million compared to $197 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 36.1% in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and
the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation, partially offset by an increase of 14.1% in the average
cost per KWH purchased.

Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern
Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.

Purchased Power - Affiliates
In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $48 million compared to $80 million for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 48.9% in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central
Alabama Generating Station generation, partially offset by an increase of 16.9% in the average cost per KWH purchased.
For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $134 million compared to $193 million for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 45.1% in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central
Alabama Generating Station generation and a reduction in capacity-related expenses due to lower capacity needs in 2024, partially offset by an
increase of 27.0% in the average cost per KWH purchased.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company
within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the
FERC.

and distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in technology
infrastructure and application production costs.
For year-to-date 2024, other operations and maintenance expenses were $1.34 billion compared to $1.28 billion for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million related to an impairment loss associated with Alabama Power discontinuing the
development of a multi-use commercial facility, $32 million in generation expenses primarily associated with Rate CNP Compliance-related
expenses, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in planned outages, $17 million in certain employee compensation and benefits, $10 million in
customer accounts primarily associated with bad debt expense, and $8 million related to the injuries and damages reserve. The increases were
partially offset by a decrease of $21 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs, as well as a $5 million increase in
nuclear property insurance refunds.

Georgia Power's net income in the third quarter 2024 was $1.1 billion compared to $0.8 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-
date 2024, net income was $2.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher
retail revenues associated with the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP
and an after-tax charge of $120 million in the third quarter 2023 related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also contributing to the
increase for year-to-date 2024 was warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Retail Revenues

periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates net of the elimination of the NCCR
tariff, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP, and higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable
demand-driven pricing. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters"
herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter 2024 and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 2.1% and 0.4% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024,
respectively, primarily due to decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased
0.6% and 2.5% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage, primarily driven by existing
data centers, and customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased 0.4% in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to decreases in
the paper and electronics sectors, partially offset by increases in the transportation and pipeline sectors. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales
were flat for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increases in the transportation and pipeline sectors, offset by decreases in the paper and electronics
sectors.
Fuel revenues and costs are allocated between retail and wholesale jurisdictions. Retail fuel cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter
and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 due to lower recoverable fuel costs. Electric rates include provisions
to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs,

including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses
and do not affect net income. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues were $78 million compared to $69 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, wholesale revenues were $198 million compared to $147 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases for the third quarter
and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of $20 million and $59 million, respectively, related to net additional capacity from
wholesale capacity contracts and $28 million and $53 million, respectively, related to the volume of KWH sales associated with higher market
demand, partially offset by decreases of $36 million and $57 million, respectively, related to the average cost per KWH sold due to lower
Southern Company system fuel and purchased power prices.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both
capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and
provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices,
the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have
a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia
Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

In the third quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $829 million compared to $928 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to $60 million of credits recorded to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal
costs, a net decrease of $33 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power, and a decrease of $6 million related to the volume of
KWHs generated and purchased.

For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was due to a net decrease of $75 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and $60 million of credits recorded
to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs, partially offset by an increase of $81 million related to the
volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" herein for additional information.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel
revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Fuel Cost
Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Fuel
In the third quarter 2024, fuel expense was $451 million compared to $576 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to $60 million of credits recorded to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs and
decreases of 12.0% in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, 7.7% in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, and 4.9% in the
volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by increases of 23.8% in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear and 17.2% in the
average cost per KWH generated by nuclear.
For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to $60 million of credits recorded to nuclear fuel expense resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs and decreases of
15.5% in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, 7.1% in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and 5.2% in the average cost per
KWH generated by natural gas, partially offset by increases of 34.4% in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, 22.8% in the average cost per
KWH generated by nuclear, and 16.5% in the volume of KWHs generated by coal.
See Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" herein for additional information.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $174 million compared to $131 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $466 million compared to $397 million for the corresponding
period in 2023. The increases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 20.3% and 22.4%, respectively, in the
volume of KWHs purchased

as Georgia Power and other Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources. Partially
offsetting the increase for year-to-date 2024 was a decrease of 7.8% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to lower natural gas
prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern
Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power - Affiliates
In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $204 million compared to $221 million for the corresponding period in
2023. For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $567 million compared to $579 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to decreases of 9.9% and 8.0%, respectively, in the volume of
KWHs purchased as Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources, partially offset by
capacity purchased through a new PPA with Mississippi Power. Also partially offsetting the decrease for year-to-date 2024 was an increase of
5.2% in the average cost per KWH purchased.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within
the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the
FERC.

and billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners, $43 million in generation expenses largely associated with non-outage
maintenance costs resulting from Plant Vogtle Unit 4 being placed in service in April 2024, and $9 million in unregulated power delivery
construction and maintenance contracts. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease of $7 million in certain employee compensation and
benefit expenses.
For year-to-date 2024, other operations and maintenance expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $87 million in generation expenses primarily associated with non-outage maintenance costs
resulting from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively, $68 million in transmission and
distribution costs primarily associated with line maintenance and billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners, $25 million in
unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, $18 million in customer service and sales costs, and $7 million in expenses
associated with unregulated energy conservation projects. Partially offsetting the increase were an increase of $92 million in gains from sales of
integrated transmission system assets and decreases of $26 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs and $15 million in
certain employee compensation and benefit expenses.

Mississippi Power's net income for year-to-date 2024 was $186 million compared to $173 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
increase was primarily due to increases in affiliate wholesale capacity revenues and retail revenues largely due to certain regulatory assets that
fully amortized in December 2023, partially offset by an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses.
Retail Revenues
In the third quarter 2024, retail revenues were $276 million compared to $284 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, retail revenues were $739 million compared to $747 million for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in retail revenues

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023 primarily due to certain regulatory assets that fully amortized in December 2023 and higher ECO Plan rates that became effective
in June 2024.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the third quarter and increased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 7.1% and 2.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively,
primarily due to decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 2.6% in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to
decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.4% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increased customer
usage. Industrial KWH sales increased 2.0% in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to increases in the chemicals and pipeline sectors. Industrial
KWH sales decreased 0.6% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the petroleum sector.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023
primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and
emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. Electric rates include
provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $66 million compared to $77 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $179 million compared to $201 million for the
corresponding period in 2023. The decreases for the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to decreases of $6 million and $9
million, respectively, associated with lower opportunity sales and decreases of $4 million and $11 million, respectively, associated with MRA
customers largely due to lower recoverable fuel costs.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power
provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi
under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for
resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable
cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff" in Item 8
of the Form 10-K for additional information.

In the third quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were $57 million compared to $65 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to decreases of $19 million related to the volume of KWH sales and $5 million related to the price of energy driven
by natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $16 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new
PPA with Georgia Power.

For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates w ere $166 million compared to $158 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was due to an increase of $46 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power. This
increase was partially offset by decreases of $30 million in capacity revenues mainly associated with Mississippi Power's lower availability of
generation reserves to the Southern Company power pool and $8 million primarily related to the volume of KWH sales.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues
related to these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

In the third quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $134 million compared to $169 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to a $24 million net decrease associated with the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and an $11 million net
decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power.

For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $363 million compared to $416 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to a $42 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an $11 million net decrease
related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy

Fuel

In the third quarter 2024, fuel expense was $123 million compared to $162 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to a 26.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 13.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, a
10.7% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, and a 1.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $334 million compared to $398 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to a 12.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, a 7.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas,
and a 5.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, partially offset by a 6.5% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by
coal.

Purchased Power

In the third quarter 2024, purchased power expense was $11 million compared to $7 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-

Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities,
and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it
may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power
into the Southern Company power pool.

*Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue*

Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a
return on investment.

Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy
demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in
energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased
power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.

*Solar and Wind Energy Revenue*

Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity
revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the
energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations
and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions,
equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information
regarding Southern Power's PPAs.

In the third quarter 2024, total operating revenues were $600 million, reflecting a $53 million, or 8.1%, decrease from the corresponding period in
2023. The change in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:
*   PPA capacity revenues increased $13 million, or 9.7%, due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs and an
increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAS.

PPA energy revenues increased $3 million, or 0.8%, primarily due to an increase of $38 million related to the volume of KWHs sold primarily
under natural gas and solar PPAs, largely offset by a decrease of $33 million driven by fuel and purchased power prices.
Non-PPA revenues decreased $60 million, or 45.8%, due to a decrease of $50 million related to the volume of KWHs sold through short-term
sales and a decrease of $10 million driven by the market price of energy.
Other revenues decreased $9 million, or 50.0%, primarily due to a prior year receipt of an arbitration award for losses previously incurred. See
Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "General Litigation Matters - Southern Power" herein for additional information.
For year-to-date 2024, total operating revenues were $1.6 billion, reflecting an $89 million, or 5.3%, decrease from the corresponding period in
2023. The change in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:
PPA capacity revenues increased $30 million, or 8.3%, due to an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs and a net
increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAS.
PPA energy revenues increased $32 million, or 3.4%, primarily due to an increase of $56 million related to the volume of KWHs sold
primarily under natural gas and solar PPAs, partially offset by a decrease of $19 million driven by fuel and purchased power prices.
Non-PPA revenues decreased $136 million, or 41.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $139 million related to the volume of KWHs sold
through short-term sales.
Other revenues decreased $15 million, or 32.6%, primarily due to decreases in receipts of liquidated damages associated with generation
facility production guarantees and a prior year receipt of an arbitration award for losses previously incurred. See Note (C) to the Condensed

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAS.
Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a
significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power
from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern
Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company
system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled
with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased
power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design,
which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also
utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations
and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. Therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact.
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution
systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. In addition, because of a rate design change affecting volumetric rates
ordered by the Illinois Commission in Nicor Gas' 2023 rate case, additional revenues are expected in the Heating Season, with a corresponding
decrease expected in revenues in the second and third quarters of each year. This change will affect the comparison of the prior year revenue for
the impacted quarters. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas and bad debt expense, are incurred
relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including
receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company
Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of annual
results and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
Net Income

|                               | Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 | Year-To-Date 2024 vs. Year-To-Date 2023 |

Southern Company Gas' net income in the third quarter 2024 was $38 million compared to $82 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to a $49 million decrease in net income at gas distribution operations.
For year-to-date 2024, net income was $555 million compared to $475 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily
due to a $51 million increase in net income at gas distribution operations, a $13 million increase in net income at gas marketing services, and a
$12 million increase in net income at all other.
Natural Gas Revenues
In the third quarter 2024, natural gas revenues, were $682 million compared to $689 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-
date 2024, natural gas revenues were $3.2 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes in natural
gas revenues were as follows:

Revenues from rate changes increased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to rate increases,
partially offset by a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Rate
Proceedings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to
lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather. See "Cost of Natural
Gas" herein for additional information.
Revenues from gas marketing services decreased for year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower
commodity prices.
Cost of Natural Gas

| | (change in millions) | (% change) | (change in millions) | (% change) |
| | $(4) | (3.9) | $(347) | (28.9) |

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in
cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented
77% and 81% of the total cost of natural gas in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "Southern Company Gas - Cost of Natural Gas" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and "Natural Gas
Revenues" herein for additional information.
For year-to-date 2024, cost of natural gas was $0.9 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease reflects
lower gas cost recovery as a result of a decrease of 22% in natural gas prices.
The following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented:

efficiency programs at gas distribution operations, $6 million in service maintenance and meter sets maintenance expenses at Nicor Gas as well as
general plant maintenance expenses, and $2 million in bad debt expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $55 million in
compensation and benefit expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory
agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity
to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest
expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a
straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution
utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general
economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other
mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in
customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
In the third quarter 2024, net income decreased $49 million, or 70.0%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further
below:
•
Operating revenues decreased $3 million primarily due to the change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas, partially offset by rate increases. Gas
costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas.

below:
*   Operating revenues decreased $174 million primarily due to lower natural gas cost over recovery, partially offset by rate increases and a
    change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of
    natural gas.
*   Operating expenses decreased $282 million primarily due to a $322 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and
    lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher
    depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefit expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The
    decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt expenses, energy
    efficiency program, and revenue taxes.
*   Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $29 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt.
*   Income taxes increased $26 million primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas" in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note (E)
to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.

Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that
were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local
distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of
hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.

In the third quarter 2024, net loss was $2 million compared to net income of $2 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The change was
primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit expenses.

For year-to-date 2024, net income increased $13 million, or 22.0%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to retail
margins and a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by higher income taxes.

All Other
All other includes a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate
operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing
arrangements. All other included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
In the third quarter 2024, net loss decreased $9 million, or 64.3%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to decreases
in operations and maintenance expense and interest expense.
For year-to-date 2024, net income was $3 million compared to a net loss of $9 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The change was
primarily due to decreases in operations and maintenance expense.
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The level of the Registrants' future earnings
depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or
distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for
the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth,
stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and
capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution
systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and
commercial markets.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, recent trends driving
projected growth in electricity consumption including the increasing digitization of the economy and growth in data centers, an increase in
industrial activity in the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and continued electrification of transportation. These growth
opportunities could be offset by energy efficiency trends in each market.
Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be affected by higher-than-expected inflation that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated policy responses of governments and central banks. In response to elevated inflation levels, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest
rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years. The actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have helped to slow the rate of inflation and
curtail economic activity. Although target levels of inflation have yet to be achieved, the U.S. Federal Reserve has initiated rate cuts and is
expected to continue policy rate reductions into 2025. The shifting economic policy variables and weakening of historic relationships among
economic activity, prices, and employment have increased the uncertainty of future levels of economic activity which will directly impact future
energy demand and operating costs. Weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing or declining energy sales. See RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during the first nine months of 2024.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters
of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy
through the development, construction, or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters;
customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully
remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which
could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and
operational limitations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Income Tax
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding the Inflation Reduction Act's expansion of the availability of federal ITCs and
PTCs and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information regarding construction projects.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas
pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities'
ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to

creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the U.S. for
state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact
on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company
Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily
driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to
earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for
natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.
Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas
production.
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition;
developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy
conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and
material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand.
Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may
be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of
potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-
utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination
thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility
industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial
condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development
arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, and "Construction Programs" herein for additional
information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations
Air Quality
On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards Good Neighbor federal
implementation plan (FIP) pending the disposition of petitions for review of the FIP in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any
petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's
motion for partial voluntary

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
remand of the FIP to address the administrative record deficiencies preliminarily identified by the U.S. Supreme Court. While the EPA completes
its supplemental review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hold challenges to the FIP in abeyance.
On October 21, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting review of a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
transferring challenges to the EPA's disapproval of interstate transport state implementation plans to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit placed the Alabama state implementation plan disapproval case
in abeyance pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the venue issue.
The ultimate impact of the FIP and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, implementation of the stayed FIP would
likely result in increased compliance costs for the traditional electric operating companies.
Water Quality
On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (ELG Final Rule), which establishes more stringent
limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no later than December 31,
2029. The ELG Final Rule maintains the existing rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's voluntary incentive
program and adds a new cessation subcategory which allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as opposed to meeting the new
more stringent requirements. The ELG Final Rule also establishes limitations for legacy wastewater which will be effective 60 days from the date
of publication. Numerous groups and states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in multiple federal circuit courts, and, on June 14, 2024,
the challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 26, 2024, industry and state petitioners filed a
motion to stay the rule pending judicial review, which was denied on October 10, 2024. The ultimate impact of the ELG Final Rule and associated
legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
Coal Combustion Residuals
On May 8, 2024, the EPA published the final legacy CCR surface impoundments rule which establishes two new categories of federally regulated
CCR, legacy surface impoundments and CCR management units (CCRMU). The rule requires legacy surface impoundments and CCRMUs to
meet certain existing regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within 42 months after the effective date of the final rule
for legacy surface impoundments and within 54 months after the effective date of the final rule for CCRMUs. The final rule also includes an
option to defer closure of previously closed units where certain criteria have been met. The final rule also includes enhanced reporting
requirements. The EPA is also finalizing an alternative provision for closure by removal that will allow certifying completion of closure of a unit
while conducting groundwater monitoring and corrective action during post-closure care. Numerous industry groups, electric generators, and
states filed petitions for review challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On August 19, 2024, an industry petitioner
filed a motion seeking to stay the legacy CCR rule pending judicial review. The ultimate impact of the final rule and associated legal matters
cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
On June 7, 2024, the EPA published a final determination to deny the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's CCR permit
program. Alabama Power's permits to close its CCR facilities remain valid under state law. In the absence of an EPA-approved state permit
program, CCR facilities in Alabama will remain subject to both the federal and state CCR rules. The ultimate impact of this action cannot be
determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision dismissing industry challenges to the EPA's January 11, 2022
actions and interpretations related to the closure performance standards in the 2015

CCR rule. The ultimate impacts of this decision and the EPA's current positions cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in
significant compliance costs.
Based on compliance requirements for closure and monitoring of CCR units pursuant to state and federal CCR rules, the traditional electric
operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for
each CCR unit as additional information related to compliance monitoring, closure methodologies and strategies, schedules, and/or costs becomes
available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power are based on closure-in-
place for all surface impoundments. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place
for some surface impoundments and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and
Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially
impacted.
Greenhouse Gases
On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final GHG rules for existing fossil fuel-fired steam electric generating units and new fossil fuel-fired
combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which requires GHG limits for subcategories of both new and existing units. The
new rules do not include standards for existing fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which have been
deferred to a future rulemaking. Requirements for existing coal-fired units are based on technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS) and natural gas co-firing. States have 24 months after the rule's publication to submit state plans for existing units. The rule allows states to
consider remaining useful life and other factors to specify alternative, unit-specific emissions limits and compliance timelines for existing units, as
needed to address reliability and other concerns. Existing source compliance will begin as early as January 1, 2030, depending on the subcategory.
The final rule incorporates some limited reliability mechanisms including a provision for short-term grid emergencies and a "reliability assurance
mechanism" that allows for a one-time, up to one year, extension of existing coal unit retirement dates specified in an approved state plan. The
standards for new combustion turbines and combined cycles include subcategories for low, intermediate, and base load operations. Compliance
with new source standards begins when the unit comes online, with requirements for CCS beginning on January 1, 2032. The EPA also
simultaneously repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. Numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states have filed petitions for
review challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A total of eight stay motions were filed seeking a stay of the rule
pending judicial review, which were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 19, 2024. On October 16, 2024, the U.S.
Supreme Court denied emergency stay applications filed by numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states. The ultimate impact of the
final rules and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
Regulatory Matters
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, OVERVIEW - "Recent Developments" herein, and Note (B) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern
Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and
improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws
and regulations.
The traditional electric operating companies are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. Major generation construction projects are subject to

state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for information regarding Georgia Power's
construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates.
See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information relating to Southern Power's construction of
renewable energy facilities.
Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution
systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth.
The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated
rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under
"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas'
construction program.
SNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing
pipeline capacity by approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt
of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2028.
Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See
Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information on SNG.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital
requirements for their construction programs.
Income Tax Matters
See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL - "Income Tax Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Inflation Reduction Act
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the Inflation Reduction
Act beginning in 2024, subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income,
as defined in the law, beginning in 2023. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed
regulations that would address the application of the CAMT. Southern Company is evaluating the proposed regulations and was not subject to the
CAMT for the 2023 tax year based on interpretations of the early guidance. However, Southern Company believes it may be subject to the CAMT
for the 2024 tax year dependent upon the final assessment of the tax treatment of Georgia Power's storm restoration costs. If applicable, the
CAMT will primarily be satisfied by tax credits. As such, the CAMT could materially impact operating cash flows of certain Registrants but will
not impact the Registrants' net income. Application of the CAMT is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury
Department and the IRS and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial
Statements under "Georgia Power - Storm Damage Recovery" herein for additional information.
Georgia State Tax Legislation
On April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.39% effective for the
2024 tax year. This legislation reduced the amount of Southern Company's and
133

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia and existing state net accumulated deferred tax liabilities, increased regulatory
liabilities at Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas, and reduces Georgia Power's ability to utilize certain state tax credits in the State of
Georgia. The legislation did not have a material impact on the net income of the applicable Registrants.
Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method
On April 30, 2024, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-23, which gives additional implementation guidance on the natural gas safe harbor
tax method of accounting for qualifying repair deductions. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas intend to submit a tax accounting
method change for qualifying expenditures with the filing of the 2024 federal income tax return. The new tax method of accounting is expected to
result in a material net positive cash flow in 2024 for Southern Company Gas; however, the timing of this positive cash flow could be delayed by
application of the CAMT. This will not have a material impact on Southern Company. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined
at this time.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows,
and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory
and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes
(B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed
Financial Statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ACCOUNTING POLICIES in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of
the Registrants' critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as recently issued accounting standards.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the Registrants' results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are
significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, *Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures* (ASU 2023-07), which requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses, other segment
items, the title and position of the chief operating decision maker (CODM), and information related to how the CODM assesses segment
performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures. Additionally, current annual disclosures will be required in interim
periods. The new standard is effective, on a retrospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-07
will have on their financial statement disclosures.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Overview" in Item 7 of the Form
10-K for additional information. The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at September 30, 2024. The Registrants intend to
continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and
liquidity needs. See "Cash Requirements," "Sources of Capital," and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
At the end of the third quarter 2024, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $90.18 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $30.39 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 297%, compared to $70.12, $28.83, and
243%, respectively, at the end of 2023. Southern Company's common stock dividend for the third quarter 2024 was $0.72 per share compared to
$0.70 per share in the third quarter 2023.
Cash Requirements
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for a description of the Registrants' significant cash requirements.
The Registrants' significant cash requirements include estimated capital expenditures associated with their construction programs and, for the
traditional electric operating companies, operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery, as well as storm restoration costs for Georgia
Power. The fuel cost under recovery balances are primarily the result of higher than forecasted prices for natural gas and purchased power. The
regulatory asset balance related to storm damage is primarily the result of significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution
facilities caused by Hurricane Helene during September 2024. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional
information.
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of
numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and
regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and
replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation, regulation,
and/or tariff policy; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes;
abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's
planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy.
In October 2024, Alabama Power's Board of Directors approved updates to its construction program that is currently
estimated to total $2.2 billion for 2025, $2.1 billion for each of 2026, 2027, and 2028, and $2.0 billion for 2029. These amounts include capital
expenditures related to nuclear fuel and LTSAs. These amounts also include estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws
and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired
electric generating units.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" herein for information regarding
Georgia Power's 2023 IRP Update, which includes incremental cash requirements for capital expenditures through 2027 of approximately $700
million.
Southern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project. The remaining aggregate construction costs for this project are
expected to be between $570 million and $700 million, including estimated capital expenditures associated with the phase three expansion of the
Millers Branch solar project, which was

committed to subsequent to September 30, 2024. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note (K) to the
Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See
"Financing Activities" herein for information on changes in the Registrants' long-term debt balances since December 31, 2023.
Sources of Capital
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Sources of Capital" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for additional information. Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings
from financial institutions, and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern
Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings.
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which
were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from
Southern Company. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. Georgia Power intends to utilize a mix of
senior note issuances, short-term floating rate bank loans, and commercial paper issuances to continue funding operating cash flows related to fuel
cost under recovery and storm restoration costs. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Storm Damage
Recovery" herein for additional information.
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2024, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the
Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary
Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax
benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology
to allocate partnership gains and losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Southern Power's tax equity funding for existing tax
equity partnerships was immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to
make money pool loans to affiliates. At September 30, 2024, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.6 billion.
This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to
materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term
debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it
matures. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at September 30, 2024 for the applicable
Registrants:

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines
of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under

(a) At September 30, 2024, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $21 million was unused. Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b) Includes $798 million and $800 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At September 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate
demand revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion
(comprised of approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition,
at September 30, 2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $157 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue
bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are
classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate
demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the
balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit.
See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Bank Credit
Arrangements" for additional information.
Short-term Borrowings
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity
support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its
commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-

Credit Rating Risk
At September 30, 2024, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or

BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel
transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, services at Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at September 30, 2024 were as follows:

(*) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances
without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $106 million of
cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at September 30, 2024.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could
require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be
provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the
Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.
On May 2, 2024, S&P upgraded the issuer credit rating for Southern Company to A- from BBB+. Due to S&P's
