CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning regulated
rates, the strategic goals for the business, customer and sales growth, economic conditions, including inflation, cost recovery and other rate actions, current and proposed
environmental regulations and related compliance plans and estimated expenditures, pending or potential litigation matters, access to sources of capital, financing
activities, completion dates and costs of construction projects, matters related to the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, filings with state and federal regulatory
authorities, and estimated construction plans and expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will,"
"could," "would," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or
other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements;
accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

*   the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory changes, including tax, environmental, and other laws and regulations to which Southern Company
    and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations;
*   the extent and timing of costs and legal requirements related to CCR;
*   current and future litigation or regulatory investigations, proceedings, or inquiries, including litigation and other disputes related to the Kemper County energy
    facility and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4;
*   the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate, including from the
    development and deployment of alternative energy sources;
*   variations in demand for electricity and natural gas;
*   available sources and costs of natural gas and other fuels and commodities;
*   the ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects, limits on pipeline capacity, public and policymaker support for such
    projects, and operational interruptions to natural gas distribution and transmission activities;
*   transmission constraints;
*   the ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of facilities or other projects due to
    challenges which include, but are not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors;
    subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor
    or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements;
    operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related
    thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or
    operational performance; challenges related to pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological
    conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a
    result of project delays;
*   legal proceedings and regulatory approvals and actions related to past, ongoing, and proposed construction projects, including PSC approvals and FERC and NRC
    actions;
*   the ability to construct facilities in accordance with the requirements of permits and licenses, to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the
    requirements of tax credits and other incentives, and to integrate facilities into the Southern Company system upon completion of construction;
*   investment performance of the employee and retiree benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds;
*   advances in technology, including the pace and extent of development of low- to no-carbon energy and battery energy storage technologies and negative carbon
    concepts;
*   performance of counterparties under ongoing renewable energy partnerships and development agreements;
*   state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations, including rate actions relating to ROE, equity ratios, additional
    generating capacity, and fuel and other cost recovery mechanisms;
*   the ability to successfully operate the traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, Southern Power's
    generation facilities, and Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage facilities and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions;
*   the inherent risks involved in operating nuclear generating facilities;

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
(continued)
*   the inherent risks involved in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and transportation and storage of natural gas, including accidents,
explosions, fires, mechanical problems, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and other environmental risks;
*   the performance of projects undertaken by the non-utility businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities;
*   internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;
*   potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern
Company or its subsidiaries;
*   the ability of counterparties of Southern Company and its subsidiaries to make payments as and when due and to perform as required;
*   the ability to obtain new short- and long-term contracts with wholesale customers;
*   the direct or indirect effect on the Southern Company system's business resulting from cyber intrusion or physical attack and the threat of cyber and physical
attacks;
*   global and U.S. economic conditions, including impacts from geopolitical conflicts, recession, inflation, tariffs, interest rate fluctuations, and financial market
conditions, and the results of financing efforts;
*   access to capital markets and other financing sources;
*   changes in Southern Company's and any of its subsidiaries' credit ratings;
*   the ability of the traditional electric operating companies to obtain additional generating capacity (or sell excess generating capacity) at competitive prices;
*   catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, wars,
or other similar occurrences;
*   the direct or indirect effects on the Southern Company system's business resulting from incidents affecting the U.S. electric grid, natural gas pipeline
infrastructure, or operation of generating or storage resources;
*   impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets;
*   the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by standard-setting bodies; and
*   other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed by the Registrants from time to time with the SEC.

The Registrants expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(A) INTRODUCTION
The condensed quarterly financial statements of each Registrant included herein have been prepared by such Registrant, without audit, pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Condensed Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 have been derived from the audited financial
statements of each Registrant. In the opinion of each Registrant's management, the information regarding such Registrant furnished herein reflects
all adjustments, which, except as otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the
periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each Registrant believes that the
disclosures regarding such Registrant are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Disclosures which would substantially
duplicate the disclosures in the Form 10-K and details which have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the filing of the Form
10-K are generally omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q unless specifically required by GAAP. Therefore, these Condensed
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. Due to the
seasonal variations in the demand for energy and other factors, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results to be expected for the full year.
Certain prior year data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on the overall results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any Registrant.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows:

impairment indicators exist.

(a) For Alabama Power and Georgia Power, reflects proceeds from the issuance of solid waste disposal facility revenue bonds in 2023 and 2022, respectively. For Southern Power,
reflects $17 million at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulting from an arbitration award held to fund future replacement costs and $3 million at December 31, 2023
held to fund estimated construction completion costs at the Deuel Harvest wind facility. See Note (C) under "General Litigation Matters - Southern Power" for additional
information related to the arbitration award. For Southern Company Gas, reflects collateral for workers' compensation, life insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
(b) Total may not add due to rounding.

Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. For any declines in market prices
below the WACOG considered to be other than temporary, an adjustment is recorded to reduce the value of natural gas inventories to market
value. Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to
year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end
are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated.

Southern Company Gas recorded no material adjustments to natural gas inventories for either period presented. Nicor Gas' inventory decrement at
June 30, 2024 is expected to be restored prior to year-end.

<sup>(*)</sup> Mississippi Power also has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, wholesale MRA fuel costs were over
recovered $11 million and $5 million, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheets. The wholesale MB fuel cost recovery was
immaterial for both periods presented.

**Alabama Power**

**Rate ECR**

On May 8, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to lower Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or
approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. The approved decrease in the Rate ECR factor will have no significant
effect on Alabama Power's net income but will decrease operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery. The rate will adjust to 5.910 cents per
KWH in January 2026 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
Alabama Power currently expects to retire Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (300 MWs based on 60% ownership) by the end of 2028. Alabama
Power and Mississippi Power continue to evaluate operating conditions and business needs relevant to the anticipated retirement of Plant Greene
County Units 1 and 2. Additionally, the unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability
improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" herein for additional
information.
Georgia Power
Integrated Resource Plans
On June 27, 2024, the FERC approved five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power with capacities of 1,258 MWs beginning in 2024, 380 MWs
beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028, procured through requests for proposals authorized in the 2019 IRP. See Note (F) under
"Georgia Power Lease Modification" for additional information.
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulation among Georgia
Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors. In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable
costs not to exceed the certified amount, on which the Georgia PSC is expected to render a decision on August 20, 2024. In doing so, the
Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the
certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of
the additional costs. Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial
operation.
Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December
2028.
Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems collocated with existing
Georgia Power-owned solar facilities, as well as the issuance of a request for proposals for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage
facilities.
Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.
On January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an Agreement for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction with Mitsubishi Power
Americas, Inc. and Black & Veatch Construction, Inc. to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Yates (Plant
Yates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter
2027, respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Transmission Asset Sales
On March 7, 2024, the FERC approved the sale of transmission line assets under the integrated transmission system agreement, with a net book
value of $236 million. On April 24, 2024, the sale, with a purchase price of $ 351 million, was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of
approximately $114 million ($84 million after tax) recorded in the second quarter 2024.

Nuclear Construction
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information on
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and cost recovery.
Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power placed Unit 3 and Unit 4 in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. Since placing Unit 4 in service, Southern
Nuclear has evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations and reduced the remaining estimate to
complete forecast by approximately $21 million. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of approximately $ 21 million
($16 million after tax) in the second quarter 2024 to recognize capital costs previously charged to income.
Georgia Power's net capital costs incurred through June 30, 2024 in connection with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and its approximate proportionate
share of additional capital costs to be incurred after June 30, 2024, including completion of site demobilization and remaining contractor
obligations, is as follows:

(a) Includes approximately $1.2 billion of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners. Excludes financing costs capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $440 million
accrued through Unit 4's in-service date.
(b) Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power's financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaled approximately $ 3.53 billion, of which $3.08 billion had
been recovered through Unit 4's in-service date.
Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit
3. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the common facilities construction costs continued to be
recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the
remaining depreciation expense until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component
of financing costs and depreciation expense are being recovered over a period of 10 years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC,
with a remaining balance of $24 million and $31 million, respectively, at June 30, 2024. The equity component of financing costs ($ 42 million at
June 30, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be
recognized in Georgia Power's statements of income in the periods it is billable to customers.
After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $ 2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for
Unit 3 and common facilities, Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as
$647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency
Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately
5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Reductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately
$310 million in 2023 and $ 80 million through the second quarter 2024. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since
commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate
AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024, which resulted in a negative impact to earnings of approximately $10 million (for one
month) in the second quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 in-service date. Effective May 1, 2024, following

commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and related financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general
retail revenue requirements. Financing costs of $10 million that were not recovered through the NCCR tariff will be addressed in Georgia Power's
next retail rate case proceeding.
Mississippi Power
Performance Evaluation Plan
On June 13, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2024 with no change in retail rates.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
On May 7, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ECO Plan filing for 2024, resulting in an $ 8 million annual increase in
revenues effective with the first billing cycle of June 2024.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
On June 13, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2024, resulting in a $ 5 million
annual decrease in revenues effective with the first billing cycle of July 2024. This decrease is not expected to have a significant effect on
Mississippi Power's net income but will affect operating cash flows.
System Restoration Rider
On April 11, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which indicated no change in retail rates. Mississippi
Power's minimum annual SRR accrual was increased from $12 million to $13 million.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4
(268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs
based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia
Power. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements,
as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $ 480 million at June 30, 2024 and Mississippi Power is continuing
to depreciate these units using the current approved rates. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement to a
regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with a 2020 Mississippi
PSC order. The Plant Watson and Plant Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement.
The 2024 IRP is subject to review by the Mississippi PSC and is expected to conclude in the third quarter 2024.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund, and
establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Southern Company Gas
Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
On June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the
program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $ 5 million allowed for the
program, for a maximum total investment over the five-year extension of $355 million.
Rate Proceedings
Atlanta Gas Light
On July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's triennial Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, filed
on February 1, 2024, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related
revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the
Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of
Transportation (GDOT) infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge, if approved, will be based on requests filed annually
on September 1, with new rates to become effective January 1 of the following year. Finally, the stipulation requires Atlanta Gas Light to include
an alternate rate plan for the three-year period of 2025 through 2027 with its 2025 GRAM filing.
On July 31, 2024, Atlanta Gas Light submitted its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC, which includes projections for the System
Reinforcement Rider and municipal, county, and GDOT surcharge adjustments. The filing requests a traditional annual base rate increase of
$120 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025. In accordance with the approved Integrated Capacity and
Delivery Plan filing, Atlanta Gas Light also included two alternative annual base rate increases for 2025 that provide for lower increases in 2025
with subsequent increases in 2026 and 2027. Resolution of the GRAM filing is expected by December 31, 2024, with new rates effective January
1, 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
On May 31, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a notice of intent with the Virginia Commission to file a base rate case on or after August 1, 2024.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
(C) CONTINGENCIES
See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits and other contingencies.
General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation
or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings not
specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have
a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants intend to dispute the allegations raised in and vigorously defend against the pending legal challenges discussed below; however,
the ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company and Mississippi Power
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $ 270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the
grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round

2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of $ 137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power
filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. In 2020,
Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled
Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with
the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of a
civil investigation related to the DOE grants. In August 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia unsealed a civil action in
which defendants Southern Company, SCS, and Mississippi Power are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the False Claims Act by
fraudulently inducing the DOE to disburse funds pursuant to the grants. The federal government declined to intervene in the action. In October
2023, the plaintiff, a former SCS employee, filed an amended complaint, again alleging certain violations of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff
seeks to recover all damages incurred personally and on behalf of the federal government caused by the defendants' alleged violations, as well as
treble damages and attorneys' fees, among other relief. On February 2, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. An adverse
outcome could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Alabama Power
In September 2022, Mobile Baykeeper filed a citizen suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama alleging that Alabama
Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond utilizing a closure-in-place methodology violates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) and regulations governing CCR. Among other relief requested, Mobile Baykeeper sought a declaratory judgment that the RCRA and
regulations governing CCR were being violated, preliminary and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of Alabama Power's closure plan,
and the development of a closure plan that satisfies regulations governing CCR requirements. In December 2022, Alabama Power filed a motion
to dismiss the case. On January 4, 2024, the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice by the U.S. District Court judge. On February 1, 2024, the
plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied by the U.S. District Court judge on July 22, 2024. The plaintiff has 30 days to appeal the
decision.
In January 2023, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violations associated with Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond.
Alabama Power has affirmed to the EPA its position that it is in compliance with CCR requirements.
These matters could have a material impact on Alabama Power's financial statements, including ARO estimates and cash flows. See Note 6 to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of Alabama Power's ARO liabilities.
Georgia Power
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint, which was amended in December 2022, in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer has impacted groundwater and air, resulting in
alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a
medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. In December 2022, the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia granted Georgia Power's motion
to transfer the case to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia. In May 2023, the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia denied
Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In July 2023, the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia
denied the remaining motions to dismiss certain claims and plaintiffs that Georgia Power filed at the outset of the case. On March 11, 2024,
Georgia Power filed a motion to dismiss certain claims. On March 14, 2024, Georgia Power filed motions for summary judgment.
In October 2021, February 2022, and January 2023, a total of eight additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries
and property damage. The plaintiffs sought an

(UNAUDITED)
unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. After Georgia Power removed these cases to the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Georgia, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without prejudice in November 2022 and January 2023. In May
2023, the plaintiffs in the cases originally filed in October 2021, February 2022, and January 2023 refiled their eight complaints in the Superior
Court of Monroe County, Georgia. Also in May 2023, a new complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against
Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal
injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including punitive damages. Also in May 2023, Georgia Power removed
all of these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The plaintiffs are requesting the court remand the cases back to the
Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia.
The amount of possible loss, if any, from these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three then-
serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to
include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon
including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper County energy facility prior to placing the Kemper County
energy facility into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by
customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were
improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid
customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of
themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.
The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of
the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against
all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file
a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state
law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In
November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In
January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In
February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In March 2022, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the
dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. In May 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi
Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings. In
June 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, which was granted on March 15, 2023.
On March 28, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In December 2023, the U.S Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint against Mississippi Power, and the plaintiffs
filed a petition for panel rehearing, which was denied on January 10, 2024. The plaintiffs did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S.
Supreme Court. This matter is now concluded.
Southern Power
In 2021, Southern Power and certain of its subsidiaries filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association against First Solar
for defective design of actuators on trackers and inverters installed by First Solar under the engineering, procurement, and construction agreements
associated with five solar projects owned by Southern Power and partners and managed by Southern Power. In 2023, Southern Power received an
award of
52

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
approximately $36 million and filed for confirmation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Subsequently in 2023, First Solar filed a motion to
dismiss the confirmation and, in February 2024, filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Supreme Court of New York County, New
York. In March 2024, Southern Power dismissed the proceeding in Delaware without prejudice and filed an opposition to First Solar's petition in
the New York matter. On May 6, 2024, the Supreme Court of New York County, New York denied First Solar's petition to vacate and confirmed
the arbitration award. This matter is now concluded.
At June 30, 2024, $ 17 million of the award remains on the balance sheet as restricted cash and as a liability to fund future replacement costs. See
Note (A) under "Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash" for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases
of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up
affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received
authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs
through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or
other applicable state regulatory agencies.
Georgia Power's environmental remediation liability was $ 14 million at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Georgia Power
has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and potential cleanup of such sites is expected.
Southern Company Gas' environmental remediation liability was $217 million and $222 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known former manufactured gas plant
operating sites. Southern Company Gas has identified one former manufactured gas plant site in North Carolina where environmental
investigation and remediation are possible. Costs associated with this site cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental
remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of the applicable Registrants.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
On June 7, 2024, the Court of Federal Claims entered a final judgment on the remaining damages in the third round of lawsuits against the U.S.
government awarding Alabama Power $33 million and Georgia Power $61 million (based on its ownership interests), which represent claims for
the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2014. All parties have until August 6, 2024 to appeal. No amounts have been recognized
in the financial statements as of June 30, 2024.
The final outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit any recoveries
for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on Southern Company's,
Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.
Other Matters
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
In April 2019, Bellsouth Telecommunications d/b/a AT&T Alabama (AT&T) filed a complaint against Alabama Power with the FCC alleging that
the pole rental rate AT&T is required to pay pursuant to the parties' joint use agreement is unjust and unreasonable under federal law. The
complaint sought a new rate and approximately

$87 million in refunds of alleged overpayments for the preceding six years. In August 2019, the FCC stayed the case in favor of arbitration, which
AT&T has not pursued. The joint use agreement remains in effect. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but an
adverse outcome could have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company and Alabama Power. Georgia Power and
Mississippi Power have joint use agreements with other AT&T affiliates.

(D) REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND LEASE INCOME
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources, some of which are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers, such
as leases, derivatives, and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Included in the wholesale electric revenues of the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power are revenues associated with affiliate transactions. These revenues are generated through long-term PPAs or short-
term energy sales made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Amounts related to these affiliate revenues are eliminated in
consolidation for Southern Company. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenues" and "Affiliate Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K for additional information. See "Lease Income" herein and Note (J) for additional information on revenue accounted for under lease and

Contract assets for Georgia Power primarily relate to retail customer fixed bill programs, where the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's
continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service
agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract liabilities for Georgia Power primarily relate to cash collections
recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements. Southern Company Gas' contract assets relate to work performed on an
energy efficiency enhancement and upgrade contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. Southern Company Gas receives cash
advances from a third-party financial institution to fund work performed, of which approximately $68 million had been received at June 30, 2024.
These advances have been accounted for as long-term debt on the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Affiliate
Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the construction contract. At June 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $118 million and $91 million, respectively, and
contract liabilities of $190 million and $115 million, respectively, for outstanding performance obligations, all of which are expected to be
satisfied within one year.

Revenues recognized in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023, were
$52 million and $77 million, respectively, for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants. Contract liabilities are primarily
classified as current on the balance sheets as the corresponding revenues are generally expected to be recognized within one year.

Remaining Performance Obligations
Southern Company's subsidiaries may enter into long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations
are satisfied over the contract term. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily relate to PPAS
whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable;
however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, these
contracts primarily relate to the U.S. General Services Administration contract described above. Southern Company's unregulated distributed
generation business also has partially satisfied performance

(E) CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Southern Company
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $ 130 million and $ 126 million,
respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings from these investments
were immaterial for all periods presented.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIES
because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to
absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Solar had total assets of $ 5.6 billion, total liabilities of $ 372 million and $399 million, respectively,
and noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to the limited partner
in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited
partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available
cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Wind had total assets of $ 2.1 billion, total liabilities of $ 185 million and $187 million, respectively,
and noncontrolling interests of $37 million and $38 million, respectively. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement, distributions without
Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter.
Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP
Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities of each entity,
including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to partner consent and the
liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any
long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax equity investors
or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the arrangements are structured similar
to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out rights.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the other VIEs had total assets of $ 1.7 billion, total liabilities of $237 million and $230 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $725 million and $761 million, respectively. Under the terms of the partnership agreements,
distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional distributions require partner consent.

(a) Arrangement expiring in 2029 represents a $2.45 billion combined arrangement for Southern Company and Southern Power as borrowers. Pursuant to the combined facility, the
allocations between Southern Company and Southern Power may be adjusted.
(b) Does not include Southern Power Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2025 and 2026, respectively,
of which $10 million and $11 million, respectively, was unused at June 30, 2024. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit
facilities.
(c) Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $ 800 million of the credit arrangement
expiring in 2029. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2029 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted
for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2029, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas
may be adjusted. Nicor Gas is also the borrower under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2025.
As reflected in the table above, in March 2024, Mississippi Power amended and restated a $ 125 million multi-year credit arrangement, which,
among other things, extended the maturity date from 2025 to 2027. In May 2024, (i) Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company
Gas Capital, along with Nicor Gas, extended the maturity

(UNAUDITED)
dates of certain of their multi-year credit arrangements from 2028 to 2029; (ii) Southern Company and Southern Power extended the maturity date
of their combined multi-year credit arrangement from 2028 to 2029; (iii) Southern Company, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO amended their credit
arrangements aggregating $150 million, $100 million, and $30 million, respectively, which extended the maturity dates from 2024 to 2025; and
(iv) Georgia Power entered into two new credit arrangements aggregating $300 million, which mature in 2025. In June 2024, Mississippi Power
amended certain of its multi-year credit arrangements aggregating $150 million, which extended the maturity dates from 2026 to 2027.
Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit
debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the
indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable
borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At June 30, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were
in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At June 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of
approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $ 69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at June 30,
2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $100 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds
outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are
classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate
demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the
balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit.
Convertible Senior Notes
In May 2024, Southern Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2024A 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15,
2027 (Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes).
Interest on the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes is payable semiannually, beginning December 15, 2024. The Series 2024A Convertible
Senior Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier converted or repurchased, but are not redeemable at the option of Southern Company.
The Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes are direct, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of Southern Company, ranking equally with all
of Southern Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding, and are effectively subordinated to all
secured indebtedness of Southern Company.
Holders may convert their Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day preceding
March 15, 2027, but only under the following circumstances:
during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Southern Company's common stock for at
least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading
day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day as
determined by Southern Company;

(UNAUDITED)
•	during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (Measurement Period) in which the trading price per $1,000
principal amount of Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product
of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or
•	upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes.
On or after March 15, 2027, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes at any time prior to the close of
business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions.
Southern Company will settle conversions of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of
the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a
combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Southern Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Southern Company's
conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes being converted. The Series
2024A Convertible Senior Notes are initially convertible at a rate of 10.8166 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount converted,
which is approximately equal to $92.45 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental
change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), Southern Company will, in certain circumstances,
increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for conversions in connection with the make-whole fundamental
change.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes), holders of the
Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes may require Southern Company to purchase all or a portion of their Series 2024A Convertible Senior
Notes, in principal amounts equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series
2024A Convertible Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Earnings per Share
For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is attributable to awards outstanding under
stock-based compensation plans and the Series 2023A convertible senior notes and Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes. EPS dilution resulting
from stock-based compensation plans is determined using the treasury stock method, and EPS dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible
senior notes and Series 2024A Convertible Senior Notes is determined using the net share settlement method. See "Convertible Senior Notes"
herein and Note 8 to the financial statements under "Convertible Senior Notes" and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K
for additional information. Shares used to compute diluted EPS were as follows:

</table>

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no anti-dilutive shares. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, an
immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because the awards were anti-dilutive.
For all periods presented, there was no dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible senior notes or Series 2024A Convertible Senior
Notes.

Georgia Power Lease Modification
See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information on Georgia Power's leases. In June 2024, Georgia Power
recognized a lease modification related to an existing affiliate PPA with Southern Power which converted from an operating lease to a finance
lease upon its approval by the FERC. As a result, Georgia Power removed from its balance sheet operating lease right-of-use assets, net of
amortization of $8 million and lease obligations of $ 10 million maturing through 2025 and recorded finance lease right-of-use assets of
$44 million and lease obligations of $ 45 million maturing through 2035. See Note (B) under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for
additional information.
(G) INCOME TAXES
See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional tax information.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable
AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal
income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs.
Details of significant changes in the effective tax rate for the applicable Registrants are provided herein.
Southern Company
Southern Company's effective tax rate was 18.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 10.7% for the corresponding period in
2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes at Alabama Power,
higher pre-tax earnings, and an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power, partially offset by
an increase in PTCs and the recognition of certain state tax positions from amended returns primarily at Georgia Power. See "Unrecognized Tax
Benefits" herein for additional information.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's effective tax rate was 21.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 3.9% for the corresponding period in 2023.
The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's effective tax rate was 18.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 15.8% for the corresponding period in 2023.
The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase in the valuation allowance on certain state tax credit
carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in PTCs and the recognition of certain state tax positions from amended returns. See "Unrecognized
Tax Benefits" herein for additional information.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's effective tax rate was 18.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 15.2% for the corresponding period in 2023.
The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Southern Company's and Georgia Power's unrecognized tax positions balances at June 30, 2024 were $ 73 million and $34 million, respectively,
compared to $116 million and $77 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The decreases from prior periods are primarily related to the 2019
and 2020 amended state filing positions related to tax credit utilization and decreased Southern Company's and Georgia Power's effective tax
rates.

(H) RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the exception of
employees at PowerSecure. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending December 31,
2024. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of management and highly
compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other
postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded
supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses.
See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
On each Registrant's condensed statements of income, the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is included in other operations and
maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic benefit costs are included in other income (expense), net. Components of the net
periodic benefit costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following tables.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power
products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market
approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and
overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market
data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected
payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present
value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair
value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's
expectation of future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value
Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note (J) for additional information on how
these derivatives are used.
For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred compensation trusts,
external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held
within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining
the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then
evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather
market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector
news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading
levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.
The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
decommissioning. See Note 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.
Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to two of its acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make generation-based
payments to the seller, commencing at the commercial operation of each facility and continuing through 2026 and 2036, respectively. The
obligations are primarily categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using significant unobservable
inputs for the forecasted facility's generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount
rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects the net present value of expected payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted
generation is expected to be immaterial.
Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection facilities and
network upgrades constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating

facility to the transmission system. The obligations are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined
using observable inputs for the contracted amounts and reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects
the net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" primarily includes investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized as
Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds, and/or agency bonds.
At June 30, 2024, the fair value measurements of private market investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are
calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $187 million and unfunded commitments related to the
private market investments totaled $89 million. Private market investments include high-quality private equity funds across several market sectors,
funds that invest in real estate assets, and a private credit fund. Private market funds do not have redemption rights. Distributions from these funds
will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.
At June 30, 2024, other financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair value were as follows:

<sup>(*)</sup> The carrying amount of Southern Company Gas' long-term debt includes fair value adjustments from the effective date of the 2016 merger with Southern Company. Southern
Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.

The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
rates available to the Registrants.

(J) DERIVATIVES

The Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as
counterparty exposure and risk management practices. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company
Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all
applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at
risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities
and are presented on a net basis. See Note (I) for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled
energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are
classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Energy-Related Derivatives

The Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes.
However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric
operating companies and certain of the

(UNAUDITED)
natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state
PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate
price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited
exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in
energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to
price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-
traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the
intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in natural gas revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
*   Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating
    companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
    liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered
    through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
*   Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge
    anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in accumulated OCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same
    period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
*   Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in
    the statements of income as incurred.

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common
and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative
unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying
goods being delivered.

At June 30, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which
the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for
derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

<sup>(*)</sup> Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a
contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of 103 million mmBtu long natural gas positions and 9 million mmBtu short natural gas positions at
June 30, 2024, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume.

(UNAUDITED)
In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply
contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas
subject to such a feature is 11 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 3 million mmBtu for Alabama Power, 4 million mmBtu for
Georgia Power, 2 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 2 million mmBtu for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax losses expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings for
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025 are $12 million for Southern Company and immaterial for Southern Power and Southern Company
Gas.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives
related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or
losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item as the
earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income
statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of
income as incurred.

For cash flow hedges of interest rate derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains and (losses) expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to
interest expense for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025 are $(15) million for Southern Company and immaterial for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Company Gas. Deferred gains and losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be amortized into
earnings through 2054 for Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, 2052 for Alabama Power, and 2046 for Southern Company
Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives
related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions,

including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate
securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are
both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the
U.S. currency exchange rates. Southern Company has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in
the fair value hedges of its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and
the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of OCI.
At June 30, 2024, the following foreign currency derivatives were outstanding:

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
The Registrants enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and
payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master
netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting across product
lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are presented net to the extent that
there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

Pre-tax gains on energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were $ 16 million and $63 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $16 million and $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and reflected
in cost of natural gas on the statements of income of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and were immaterial for the other
Registrants for all periods presented.

Contingent Features
The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit
rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit,
or cash. At June 30, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

For Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and
the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
$65 million at June 30, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
$15 million at June 30, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with
contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below
BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at June 30, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related
contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.

Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative
transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin
requirements. At June 30, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern
Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on
the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into
these accounts. At June 30, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $24 million.

The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally
enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in
order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to
post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or
letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to
entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the
counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas
may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable
Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting
and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded
on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

(L) SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
Southern Company
The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power
and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities
providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets,
including renewable energy and battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern
Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses
including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services.
Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity
in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern
Company Gas. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $86 million and $179 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively and $116 million and $251 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power
were immaterial for all periods presented. The "All Other" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate
operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These
segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and
utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.

segment reporting. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially
all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the
sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market. For additional information on the Registrants' primary business activities, see BUSINESS
- "The Southern Company System" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K.
The Registrants continue to focus on several key performance indicators. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company
Gas, these indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and
execution of major construction projects. Southern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree
Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating
Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system.
For Southern Power, key performance indicators include, but are not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to
evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers. In addition, Southern Company and the
Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator.
Recent Developments
Alabama Power
On May 8, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to lower Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or
approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Alabama
Power - Rate ECR" herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status
Georgia Power placed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service on July 31, 2023 and April 29, 2024, respectively. Since placing Unit 4 in service,
Southern Nuclear has evaluated the remaining expected site demobilization costs and other contractor obligations and reduced the remaining
estimate to complete forecast by approximately $21 million. Accordingly, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of approximately
$21 million ($16 million after tax) in the second quarter 2024 to recognize capital costs previously charged to income. Georgia Power's share of
the total project capital cost forecast, including completion of site demobilization and remaining contractor obligations, is $10.7 billion. See Note
(B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule" herein for additional information.
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power included in retail rate base $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base
items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues
increased approximately $730 million and the average

retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia
Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024,
following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters" herein for additional
information.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulation among Georgia
Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors, which includes the authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from
three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated
Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Mississippi Power
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4
(268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs
based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028. The 2024 IRP is subject to review by the Mississippi PSC and is expected to conclude in the
third quarter 2024.
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order accepting Mississippi Power's request effective May 29, 2024, subject to refund, and
establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Mississippi Power" herein for additional information.
Southern Power
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 150-MW South Cheyenne solar
facility. In addition, Southern Power continued construction of the 200-MW first phase and the 180-MW second phase of the Millers Branch solar
facility. Southern Power also committed to expand construction by an additional 90 MWs through a third phase of the Millers Branch solar
project. The third phase of the facility's output is contracted under a 15-year PPA and commercial operation is projected to occur in the fourth
quarter 2026. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
At June 30, 2024, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for
facilities under construction) as the investment amount was 97% through 2028 and 89% through 2033, with an average remaining contract
duration of approximately 12 years.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
$0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the
System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects
related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new
surcharge, if approved, will be based on requests filed annually on September 1, with new rates to become effective January 1 of the following
year. Finally, the stipulation requires Atlanta Gas Light to include an alternate rate plan for the three-year period of 2025 through 2027 with its
2025 GRAM filing.
On July 31, 2024, Atlanta Gas Light submitted its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC, which includes projections for the System
Reinforcement Rider and municipal, county, and GDOT surcharge adjustments. The filing requests a traditional annual base rate increase of
$120 million. In accordance with the approved Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan filing, Atlanta Gas Light also included two alternative
annual base rate increases for 2025 that provide for lower increases in 2025 with subsequent increases in 2026 and 2027. Resolution of the GRAM
filing is expected by December 31, 2024, with new rates effective January 1, 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
On June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the
program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $ 5 million allowed for the
program, for a maximum total investment over the five-year extension of $355 million.

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $1.2 billion ($1.10 per share) in the second quarter 2024 compared to $0.8 billion
($0.77 per share) for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was
$2.3 billion ($2.13 per share) compared to $1.7 billion ($1.56 per share) for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to
increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 compared to the
corresponding period in 2023, an increase in natural gas revenues from rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and a decrease in non-fuel
operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes,
and cost of other sales. Also contributing to the year-to-date 2024 increase was an increase in retail electric revenues associated with colder
weather in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023 primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates at Georgia Power, base tariff increases at Georgia Power
in accordance with its 2022 ARP, customer bill credits in 2023 at Alabama Power related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred
income taxes, an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues at Alabama Power, and higher contributions from commercial and industrial
customers with variable demand-driven pricing at Georgia Power, partially offset by a decrease in revenues recognized under the NCCR tariff at
Georgia Power primarily due to its elimination in the second quarter 2024 following commercial operation of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. See Note (B) to
the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters" herein and Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in
2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.0% in the second quarter 2024 primarily due to decreased customer usage. Weather-
adjusted residential KWH sales increased 0.1% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH
sales increased 2.8% and 3.3% in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage. Industrial
KWH sales were flat in the second quarter 2024 and increased 0.2% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increases in the transportation and
lumber sectors, largely offset by decreases in the paper and primary metals sectors.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased $57 million and $19 million in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, compared
to the corresponding periods in 2023 primarily due to higher recoverable fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rates for the traditional electric
operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs.
Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income.
The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other
compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note
(B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

In the second quarter 2024, wholesale electric revenues were $627 million compared to $605 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
increase was due to a $20 million increase in energy revenues primarily resulting from an increase in the volume of KWHs sold under solar and
wind PPAs at Southern Power and a $2 million

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
increase in capacity revenues primarily resulting from new capacity contracts at Georgia Power and increased capacity revenues associated with
natural gas PPAs at Southern Power, largely offset by a decrease resulting from power sales agreements that ended in May 2023 at Alabama
Power.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than
solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income
and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market
prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's
electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are
driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales
from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility
through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and
maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions,
equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated
municipal and rural association sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in
2023 primarily due to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather
when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural
gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not
affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
Revenues from gas marketing services decreased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023
primarily due to lower commodity prices.

In the second quarter 2024, other revenues were $309 million compared to $223 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, other revenues were $537 million compared to $440 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increases in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of $48 million and $49 million, respectively, at PowerSecure primarily related to distributed
infrastructure and energy efficiency projects, $35 million and $42 million, respectively, in unregulated sales at Georgia Power primarily
associated with power delivery construction and maintenance projects, energy conservation projects, and outdoor lighting, and $8 million for both
periods in unregulated sales of products and services at Alabama Power, partially offset by decreases of $13 million and $12 million, respectively,
at Southern Linc primarily related to sales associated with commercial customers.

In the second quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to a net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was due to a $56 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a $22 million net
increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have
a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.

(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.

Fuel

In the second quarter 2024, fuel expense was $1.03 billion compared to $959 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to a 25.4% increase in the average cost per KWH generated by nuclear, a 23.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal,
a 23.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, a 15.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, and a 5.8%
increase in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 13.2% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by
coal.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $2.03 billion compared to $2.01 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily
due to a 20.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 19.7% increase in the average cost per KWH generated by nuclear, a 16.7%
increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, and a 16.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a
9.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, a 3.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and a 2.2%
decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas.

Purchased Power

In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense was $222 million compared to $231 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-
to-date 2024, purchased power expense was $420 million compared to $473 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases in the
second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to decreases of 9.7% and 15.3%, respectively, in the volume of KWHs purchased
primarily as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station
generation, both at Alabama Power, partially offset by increases of 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively, in the average cost per KWH purchased.

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities' rates include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount
expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas - Natural Gas Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural
gas distribution utilities represented 81% of the total cost of natural gas for both the second quarter and year-to-date 2024.
In the second quarter 2024, cost of natural gas was $149 million compared to $199 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For year-to-date
2024, cost of natural gas was $0.8 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases reflect lower gas cost
recovery as a result of decreases of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively.

$30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, and a decrease of $20 million in technology infrastructure and application production
costs, partially offset by increases of $20 million in employee compensation and benefit expenses, $18 million in generation expenses primarily
associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service at Georgia Power, $16 million in customer service and sales expenses primarily
associated with demand-side management costs at Georgia Power, $10 million in expenses associated with unregulated energy conservation
projects at Georgia Power, and $7 million related to the injuries and damages reserve primarily at Alabama Power, as well as a gain of $6 million

For year-to-date 2024, other operations and maintenance expenses were $2.88 billion compared to $2.93 billion for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $95 million increase in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets at Georgia Power, a
decrease of $49 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs, a $30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor
Gas, and a $20 million decrease in expenses passed through to customers primarily related to bad debt and energy efficiency programs at Southern
Company Gas, partially offset by increases of $70 million in generation expenses primarily associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being
placed in service at Georgia Power, Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses at Alabama Power, and maintenance and scheduled outage expenses
at Southern Power, $33 million in employee compensation and benefit expenses, $24 million in customer service and sales expenses primarily
associated with demand-side management costs at Georgia Power, $13 million in expenses associated with unregulated energy conservation
projects at Georgia Power, and $10 million in transmission and distribution costs primarily associated with line maintenance and billing
adjustments with integrated transmission system owners at Georgia Power.

Alabama Power's net income in the second quarter 2024 was $369 million compared to $312 million for the corresponding period in 2023. For
year-to-date 2024, net income was $702 million compared to $568 million for the corresponding period in 2023. These increases were primarily
due to an increase in retail revenues associated with warmer weather in the second quarter 2024 in the Alabama Power service territory compared
to the corresponding period in 2023 and an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues, as well as a decrease in non-fuel operations and
maintenance expenses. These increases to income were partially offset by increases in income tax expense and depreciation. Also contributing to
the year-to-date 2024 increase was an increase in retail electric revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2024 compared to the
corresponding period in 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023 primarily due to customer bill credits in 2023 related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes as well
as an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales were relatively flat in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.3% and 0.9% in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively,
primarily due to a decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.4% and 1.4% in the second quarter and year-
to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in customer usage. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.5% in the second quarter primarily
due to an increase in the chemicals sector. Industrial KWH sales decreased 0.2% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the primary
metals sector.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023
primarily as a result of higher recoverable fuel costs.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs
associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and
do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

In the second quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $84 million compared to $112 million for the corresponding
period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 39.5% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended
in May 2023, partially offset by a 24.8% increase in the price of energy as a result of higher natural gas prices.
For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $169 million compared to $252 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 50.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May
2023, partially offset by a 36.3% increase in the price of energy as a result of higher natural gas prices.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also
included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above
Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.

year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 166.5% and 191.9%, respectively, in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company
energy needs.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy
revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

million increase in transmission revenue primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in
rent revenues.

For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $852 million compared to $879 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was due to a $19 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and an $8 million net decrease
related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate ECR" in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.

Fuel

In the second quarter 2024, fuel expense was $335 million compared to $303 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to a 39.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, a 15.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal,
and a 24.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by a 17.1% decrease in the
volume of KWHs generated by nuclear and an 11.7% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $666 million compared to $611 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily
due to a 34.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, a 12.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an
18.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by an 8.3% decrease in the average
cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, a 7.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, and a
7.3% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal.

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates

In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $47 million compared to $54 million for the corresponding period in
2023. For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $99 million compared to $155 million for the corresponding
period in 2023. The decreases for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to decreases of 40.4% and 49.0%, respectively, in
the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama
Generating Station generation, partially offset by increases of 35.2% and 22.6%, respectively, in the average cost per KWH purchased due to
higher natural gas prices.

Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern
Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.

Purchased Power - Affiliates

In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $44 million compared to $54 million for the corresponding period in
2023. For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $87 million

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
compared to $113 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decreases for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to
decreases of 43.7% and 41.4%, respectively, in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama
Generating Station generation, partially offset by increases of 44.5% and 30.8%, respectively, in the average cost per KWH purchased due to
higher natural gas prices.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company
within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the
FERC.

In the second quarter 2024, other operations and maintenance expenses were $429 million compared to $440 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $10 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs, $7 million in
transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management, and $4 million in generation expenses primarily associated with
planned and unplanned outages, partially offset by an increase in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses. The decreases were partially offset by
increases of $5 million in employee compensation and benefits, $5 million in expenses related to unregulated products and services, and $5
million related to the injuries and damages reserve.
For year-to-date 2024, other operations and maintenance expenses were $840 million compared to $862 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $17 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs and $7 million in
transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management, as well as a $5 million increase in nuclear property insurance
refunds. The decreases were partially offset by a $13 million increase in generation expenses primarily associated with Rate CNP Compliance-
related expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
additional information.

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates, base tariff increases in accordance
with the 2022 ARP, and higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, partially offset by a
decrease in revenues recognized under the NCCR tariff primarily due to its elimination in the second quarter 2024 following commercial
operation of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory
Matters" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in
2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 0.7% in the second quarter 2024 primarily due to decreased customer usage, partially
offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 0.6% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to customer growth,
partially offset by decreased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.4% and 3.7% in the second quarter and year-
to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage and customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased
1.3% in the second quarter 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the paper sector, partially offset by increases in the transportation and mining
sectors. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 0.2% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increases in the transportation and lumber
sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the paper sector.
Fuel revenues and costs are allocated between retail and wholesale jurisdictions. Retail fuel cost recovery revenues increased in the second quarter
and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 due to higher fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rates include
provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost
recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

million, respectively, related to the volume of KWH sales associated with higher market demand, partially offset by decreases of $17 million and
$23 million, respectively, related to the average cost per KWH sold due to lower Southern Company system fuel and purchased power prices.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both
capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and
provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices,
the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have
a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia
Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

of fuel and purchased power.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel
revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2

Fuel
In the second quarter 2024, fuel expense was $441 million compared to $414 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to increases of 44.9% in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, 36.1% in the average cost per KWH generated by nuclear,
31.2% in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and 6.7% in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, partially offset by decreases of
19.5% in the average cost per KWH generated by coal and 10.0% in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $830 million compared to $816 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily
due to increases of 40.9% in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear, 34.0% in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and 30.1% in the
average cost per KWH generated by nuclear, partially offset by decreases of 18.8% in the average cost per KWH generated by coal, 8.3% in the
volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and 3.5% in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas.

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $151 million compared to $142 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $291 million compared to $266 million for the corresponding
period in 2023. The increases for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of 21.9% and 23.8%, respectively, in
the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power and other Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available
market resources, partially offset by decreases of 14.1% and 11.6%, respectively, in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to lower
natural gas prices.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern
Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power - Affiliates
In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $182 million compared to $152 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to capacity purchased through a new PPA with Mississippi Power and an increase of 3.1% in the volume of
KWHs purchased largely due to higher customer demand.
For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $363 million compared to $358 million for the corresponding period in 2023.
The increase was primarily due to capacity purchased through a new PPA with Mississippi Power, partially offset by a decrease of 6.9% in the
volume of KWHs purchased as Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within
the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the
FERC.

period in 2023. The decreases for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were primarily due to increases of $115 million and $95 million,
respectively, in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets and decreases of $13 million and $30 million, respectively, in technology
infrastructure and application production costs. Partially offsetting these decreases for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 were increases of
$28 million and $44 million, respectively, in generation expenses primarily associated with non-outage maintenance costs resulting from Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively, $15 million and $16 million, respectively, in unregulated
power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, $14 million and $18 million, respectively, in customer service and sales costs primarily
associated with demand-side management costs, $13 million and $21 million, respectively, in transmission and distribution costs primarily

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding
periods in 2023 primarily due to certain regulatory assets that fully amortized in December 2023.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in
2023. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 2.7% in the second quarter 2024 primarily due to decreased customer usage. Weather-
adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.0% for year-to-date 2024 primarily due to increased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial
KWH sales increased 7.6% and 7.5% in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage.
Industrial KWH sales decreased 2.2% and 2.0% in the second quarter and year-to-date 2024, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the
petroleum sector.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in the second quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a
result of an increase in ad valorem taxes. Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased for year-to-date 2024 when compared to the
corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power
expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service
territory. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power
costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not
affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $113 million compared to $124 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $5 million decrease associated with changes in power supply agreements, a $4 million decrease
associated with MRA customers largely due to lower recoverable fuel costs, and a $3 million decrease associated with lower opportunity sales.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In

addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in
southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. Short-term opportunity energy sales are
also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above
Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural

In the second quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were $58 million compared to $18 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $16 million related to the volume of KWH sales, $15 million in capacity revenues associated
with a new PPA with Georgia Power, and $8 million related to the price of energy driven by natural gas prices.
For year-to-date 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates w ere $109 million compared to $93 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $31 million in capacity revenues associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power, $10
million related to the price of energy driven by natural gas prices, and $6 million related to the volume of KWH sales. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of $31 million in capacity revenues mainly associated with Mississippi Power's lower availability of generation
reserves to the Southern Company power pool.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues
related to these transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power.
For year-to-date 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $229 million compared to $246 million for the corresponding period in

increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

primarily due to a 176.6% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal and a 10.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural
gas, partially offset by a 7.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal and a 3.0% decrease in the average cost per KWH
generated by natural gas.

For year-to-date 2024, fuel expense was $211 million compared to $235 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to a 14.4% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, an 11.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH
generated by coal, and a 2.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 69.7% increase in the volume of
KWHs generated by coal.

Purchased Power
In the second quarter 2024, purchased power expense was $11 million compared to $7 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase
was primarily due to an increase of 32.2% in the volume of KWHs purchased and an increase of 20.1% in the average cost per KWH purchased
primarily due to higher natural gas prices.

For year-to-date 2024, purchased power expense was $18 million compared to $11 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to increases of 46.5% in the volume of KWHs purchased and 6.9% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher
natural gas prices.

Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities,
and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it
may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power
into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a
return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy
demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in
energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased
power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity
revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the
energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations
and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions,
equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information
regarding Southern Power's PPAs.

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs.
Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a
significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power
from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern
Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company
system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled
with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased
power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

Southern Company Gas

Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design,
which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its

utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of
warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. Therefore, weather
typically does not have a significant net income impact.
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution
systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. In addition, because of a rate design change affecting volumetric rates
ordered by the Illinois Commission in Nicor Gas' 2023 rate case, additional revenues are expected in the Heating Season, with a corresponding
decrease expected in revenues in the second and third quarters of each year. This change will affect the comparison of the prior year revenue for
the impacted quarters. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas and bad debt expense, are incurred
relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including
receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company
Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of annual
results and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

efficiency programs at gas distribution operations, $6 million in service maintenance and meter sets maintenance expenses at Nicor Gas as well as
general plant maintenance expenses, and $3 million in bad debt expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $24 million in
compensation and benefit expenses and a gain of $6 million on the sale of a service center in 2023.

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory
agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity
to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest
expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a
straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution
utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general
economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other
mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in
customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
In the second quarter 2024, net income increased $20 million, or 33.3%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further
below:
•	Operating revenues decreased $15 million primarily due to lower natural gas cost recovery and change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas,
partially offset by rate increases and a prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues
generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

*   Operating expenses decreased $54 million primarily due to a $46 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher compensation and benefit expenses, higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, and the gain on sale of a service center in 2023.
*   Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $9 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt.
*   Income taxes increased $8 million primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.

For year-to-date 2024, net income increased $101 million, or 35.9%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further below:

*   Operating revenues decreased $171 million primarily due to lower natural gas cost over recovery, partially offset by rate increases, a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas, and the prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas.
*   Operating expenses decreased $330 million primarily due to a $319 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $30 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefit expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt expenses, energy efficiency program, and revenue taxes.
*   Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $18 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt.
*   Income taxes increased $40 million primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Gas Pipeline Investments

Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.

Gas Marketing Services

Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.

For year-to-date 2024, net income increased $18 million, or 32.1%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to retail margins and a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by higher income taxes.

All Other

All other includes a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. All other included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The level of the Registrants' future earnings
depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or
distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for
the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth,
stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and
capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution
systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and
commercial markets.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, recent trends driving
projected growth in electricity consumption including the increasing digitization of the economy and growth in data centers, an increase in
industrial activity in the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and continued electrification of transportation. These growth
opportunities could be offset by energy efficiency trends in each market.
Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be affected by higher-than-expected inflation that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated policy responses of governments and central banks. In response to elevated inflation levels, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest
rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years. The actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have helped to slow the rate of inflation and
curtail economic activity. Although target levels of inflation have yet to be achieved, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated its current intention to
pause future rate increases and evaluate rate cuts depending on the current economic data. The shifting economic policy variables and weakening
of historic relationships among economic activity, prices, and employment have increased the uncertainty of future levels of economic activity
which will directly impact future energy demand and operating costs. Weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing or declining
energy sales. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during
the first six months of 2024.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters
of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy
through the development, construction, or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters;
customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully
remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which
could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and
operational limitations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Income Tax
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding the Inflation Reduction Act's expansion of the availability of federal ITCs and
PTCs and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information regarding construction projects.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas
pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities'
ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to
projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and
improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects;
customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the
U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an
124

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern
Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices,
primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations
to earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand
for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term
basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of
natural gas production.

Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition;
developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy
conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and
material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand.
Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may
be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.

As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of
potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-
utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination
thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility
industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial
condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development
arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

For additional information relating to these issues, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –

Environmental Matters

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters" and - FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and
Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, as well as Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "General
Litigation Matters" and "Environmental Remediation" herein, for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations

*Air Quality*

On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards Good Neighbor federal
implementation plan (FIP) pending the disposition of petitions for review of the FIP in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and any
petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ultimate impact of the FIP and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this
time; however, implementation of the stayed FIP would likely result in increased compliance costs for the traditional electric operating companies.

*Water Quality*

On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (ELG Final Rule), which establishes more stringent
limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no later than December 31,
2029. The ELG Final Rule maintains the existing

125

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's voluntary incentive program and adds a new cessation subcategory which
allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as opposed to meeting the new more stringent requirements. The ELG Final Rule
also establishes limitations for legacy wastewater which will be effective 60 days from the date of publication. Numerous groups and states filed
petitions for review challenging the rule in multiple circuit courts, and, on June 14, 2024, the challenges were consolidated in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 26, 2024, an industry group and the states filed a motion to stay the rule pending judicial review. The
ultimate impact of the ELG Final Rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant
compliance costs.
Coal Combustion Residuals
On May 8, 2024, the EPA published the final legacy CCR surface impoundments rule which establishes two new categories of federally regulated
CCR, legacy surface impoundments and CCR management units (CCRMU). The rule requires legacy surface impoundments and CCRMUs to
meet certain existing regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within 42 months after the effective date of the final rule
for legacy surface impoundments and within 54 months after the effective date of the final rule for CCRMUs. The final rule also includes an
option to defer closure of previously closed units where certain criteria have been met. The final rule also includes enhanced reporting
requirements. The EPA is also finalizing an alternative provision for closure by removal that will allow certifying completion of closure of a unit
while conducting groundwater monitoring and corrective action during post-closure care. On June 13, 2024, an electric generator filed a petition
for review challenging the final legacy CCR surface impoundments rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The ultimate impact of
the final rule and associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
On June 7, 2024, the EPA published a final determination to deny the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's CCR permit
program. Alabama Power's permits to close its CCR facilities remain valid under state law. In the absence of an EPA-approved state permit
program, CCR facilities in Alabama will remain subject to both the federal and state CCR rules. The ultimate impact of this action cannot be
determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision dismissing industry challenges to the EPA's January 11, 2022
actions and interpretations related to the closure performance standards in the 2015 CCR rule. The ultimate impacts of this decision and the EPA's
current positions cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
Based on compliance requirements for closure and monitoring of CCR units pursuant to state and federal CCR rules, the traditional electric
operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for
each CCR unit as additional information related to compliance monitoring, closure methodologies and strategies, schedules, and/or costs becomes
available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power are based on closure-in-
place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash
ponds and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval
by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted.
Greenhouse Gases
On May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final GHG rules for existing fossil fuel-fired steam electric generating units and new fossil fuel-fired
combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which requires GHG limits for subcategories of both new and existing units. The
new rules do not include standards for existing fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which have been
deferred to a future rulemaking. Requirements for existing coal-fired units are based on technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS)

and natural gas co-firing. States have 24 months after the rule's publication to submit state plans for existing units. The rule allows states to
consider remaining useful life and other factors to specify alternative, unit-specific emissions limits and compliance timelines for existing units, as
needed to address reliability and other concerns. Existing source compliance will begin as early as January 1, 2030, depending on the subcategory.
The final rule incorporates some limited reliability mechanisms including a provision for short-term grid emergencies and a "reliability assurance
mechanism" that allows for a one-time, up to one year, extension of existing coal unit retirement dates specified in an approved state plan. The
standards for new combustion turbines and combined cycles include subcategories for low, intermediate, and base load operations. Compliance
with new source standards begins when the unit comes online, with requirements for CCS beginning on January 1, 2032. The EPA also
simultaneously repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. Numerous industry groups, electric generators, and states have filed petitions for
review challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A total of eight stay motions were filed seeking a stay of the rule
pending judicial review, which were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 19, 2024. Numerous industry groups,
electric generators, and states have filed emergency stay applications to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ultimate impact of the final rules and
associated legal matters cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
Regulatory Matters
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, OVERVIEW – "Recent Developments" herein, and Note (B) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern
Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and
improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws
and regulations.
The traditional electric operating companies are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See
Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Georgia Power -
Integrated Resource Plans" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates.
See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information relating to Southern Power's construction of
renewable energy facilities.
Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution
systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and resiliency, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth.
The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated
rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under
"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas'
construction program.
SNG is developing an approximately $3 billion proposed pipeline project, designed to meet customer demand by increasing SNG's existing
pipeline capacity by approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the receipt
of all required approvals by regulators, including the FERC, the operator of the joint venture anticipates the project will be completed in 2028.
Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs would be 50%. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See
Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information on SNG.

requirements for their construction programs.
Income Tax Matters
See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL - "Income Tax Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Inflation Reduction Act
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the Inflation Reduction
Act beginning in 2024, subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Georgia State Tax Legislation
On April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduced the corporate income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.39% effective for the
2024 tax year. This legislation reduced the amount of Southern Company's and certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia
and existing state net accumulated deferred tax liabilities, increased regulatory liabilities at Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas, and
reduces Georgia Power's ability to utilize certain state tax credits in the State of Georgia. The legislation did not have a material impact on the net
income of the applicable Registrants.
Natural Gas Safe Harbor Method
On April 30, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure 2024-23, which gives additional implementation guidance on the
natural gas safe harbor tax method of accounting for qualifying repair deductions. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas intend to
submit a tax accounting method change for qualifying expenditures with the filing of the 2024 federal income tax return. The new tax method of
accounting is expected to result in a material net positive cash flow in 2024 for Southern Company Gas. This will not have a material impact on
Southern Company. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows,
and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory
and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes
(B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed
Financial Statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ACCOUNTING POLICIES in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of
the Registrants' critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as recently issued accounting standards.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the Registrants' results of operations and related

disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial
statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Overview" in Item 7 of the Form
10-K for additional information. The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at June 30, 2024. The Registrants intend to continue to
monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity
needs. See "Cash Requirements," "Sources of Capital," and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
At the end of the second quarter 2024, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $77.57 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $29.65 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 262%, compared to $70.12, $28.83, and
243%, respectively, at the end of 2023. Southern Company's common stock dividend for the second quarter 2024 was $0.72 per share compared to
$0.70 per share in the second quarter 2023.
Cash Requirements
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for a description of the Registrants' significant cash requirements.
The Registrants' significant cash requirements include estimated capital expenditures associated with their construction programs and, for the
traditional electric operating companies, operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery. The fuel cost under recovery balances are
primarily the result of higher than forecasted prices for natural gas and purchased power. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information.
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of
numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and
regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and
replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation, regulation,
and/or tariff policy; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes;
abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's
planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" herein for information regarding
Georgia Power's 2023 IRP Update, which includes incremental cash requirements for capital expenditures through 2027 of approximately $700
million.
Southern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch solar project. At June 30, 2024, the remaining aggregate construction costs
for this project are expected to be between $560 million and $680 million. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See
"Financing Activities" herein for information on changes in the Registrants' long-term debt balances since December 31, 2023.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Sources of Capital
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Sources of Capital" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for additional information. Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings
from financial institutions, and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern
Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings.
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which
were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from
Southern Company. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. Georgia Power intends to utilize a mix of
senior note issuances, short-term floating rate bank loans, and commercial paper issuances to continue funding operating cash flows related to fuel
cost under recovery.
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2024, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the
Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary
Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax
benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology
to allocate partnership gains and losses. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Southern Power's tax equity funding for existing tax equity
partnerships was immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to
make money pool loans to affiliates. At June 30, 2024, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.9 billion. This
restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially
impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term
debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it
matures. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at June 30, 2024 for the applicable Registrants:

At June 30, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Southern Company</th>
    <th>Georgia Power<br>(in millions)</th>
    <th>Southern Company Gas</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Current liabilities in excess of current assets</td>
    <td>$ 1,035</td>
    <td>$ 1,092</td>
    <td>$ 186</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines
of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize
equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.

(a) At June 30, 2024, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $21 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries
are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b) Includes $798 million and $800 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At June 30, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of
approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at June 30,
2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $207 million and $100 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds
outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's $207 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are
classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate
demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the
balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit.
See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Bank Credit
Arrangements" for additional information.
Short-term Borrowings
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity
support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its
commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-

above, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Subsidiary Registrants also used the
proceeds for their construction programs.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, the Registrants plan to continue,
when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

During the first six months of 2024, Southern Company issued approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock primarily through employee
equity compensation plans.

(*) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances
without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $106 million of
cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at June 30, 2024.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could
require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be
provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the
Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.
On May 2, 2024, S&P upgraded the issuer credit rating for Southern Company to A- from BBB+. Due to S&P's rating methodology, the upgrade
of Southern Company's issuer credit rating resulted in the upgrade of the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Mississippi Power, Southern
Company Gas Capital, and Atlanta Gas Light to A- from BBB+, the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A from BBB+,
the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Alabama Power to A from A-, and the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Southern
Company and Southern Power to BBB+ from BBB. Nicor Gas' long-term issuer rating remained at A-. S&P revised its credit rating outlook for
Southern Company and its subsidiaries to stable from positive.
