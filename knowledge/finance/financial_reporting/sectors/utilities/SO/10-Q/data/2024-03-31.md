CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning regulated
rates, the strategic goals for the business, customer and sales growth, economic conditions, including inflation, cost recovery and other rate actions, current and proposed
environmental regulations and related compliance plans and estimated expenditures, pending or potential litigation matters, access to sources of capital, financing
activities, completion dates and costs of construction projects, matters related to the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, filings with state and federal regulatory
authorities, and estimated construction plans and expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will,"
"could," "would," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or
other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements;
accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

*   the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory changes, including tax, environmental, and other laws and regulations to which Southern Company
    and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations;
*   the extent and timing of costs and legal requirements related to CCR;
*   current and future litigation or regulatory investigations, proceedings, or inquiries, including litigation and other disputes related to the Kemper County energy
    facility and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4;
*   the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate, including from the
    development and deployment of alternative energy sources;
*   variations in demand for electricity and natural gas;
*   available sources and costs of natural gas and other fuels and commodities;
*   the ability to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure projects, limits on pipeline capacity, public and policymaker support for such
    projects, and operational interruptions to natural gas distribution and transmission activities;
*   transmission constraints;
*   the ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of facilities or other projects due to
    challenges which include, but are not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors;
    subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor
    or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements;
    operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related
    thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or
    operational performance; challenges related to pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological
    conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a
    result of project delays;
*   legal proceedings and regulatory approvals and actions related to past, ongoing, and proposed construction projects, including PSC approvals and FERC and NRC
    actions;
*   the ability to construct facilities in accordance with the requirements of permits and licenses, to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the
    requirements of tax credits and other incentives, and to integrate facilities into the Southern Company system upon completion of construction;
*   investment performance of the employee and retiree benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds;
*   advances in technology, including the pace and extent of development of low- to no-carbon energy and battery energy storage technologies and negative carbon
    concepts;
*   performance of counterparties under ongoing renewable energy partnerships and development agreements;
*   state and federal rate regulations and the impact of pending and future rate cases and negotiations, including rate actions relating to ROE, equity ratios, additional
    generating capacity, and fuel and other cost recovery mechanisms;
*   the ability to successfully operate the traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, Southern Power's
    generation facilities, and Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage facilities and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions;
*   the inherent risks involved in operating nuclear generating facilities;

(continued)
*   the inherent risks involved in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and transportation and storage of natural gas, including accidents,
explosions, fires, mechanical problems, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and other environmental risks;
*   the performance of projects undertaken by the non-utility businesses and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities;
*   internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued;
*   potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern
Company or its subsidiaries;
*   the ability of counterparties of Southern Company and its subsidiaries to make payments as and when due and to perform as required;

or other similar occurrences;
*   the direct or indirect effects on the Southern Company system's business resulting from incidents affecting the U.S. electric grid, natural gas pipeline
infrastructure, or operation of generating or storage resources;
*   impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets;

*   other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including the Form 10-K) filed by the Registrants from time to time with the SEC.

The Registrants expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
(A) INTRODUCTION
The condensed quarterly financial statements of each Registrant included herein have been prepared by such Registrant, without audit, pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Condensed Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 have been derived from the audited financial
statements of each Registrant. In the opinion of each Registrant's management, the information regarding such Registrant furnished herein reflects
all adjustments, which, except as otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the
periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each Registrant believes that the
disclosures regarding such Registrant are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Disclosures which would substantially
duplicate the disclosures in the Form 10-K and details which have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the filing of the Form
10-K are generally omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q unless specifically required by GAAP. Therefore, these Condensed
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. Due to the
seasonal variations in the demand for energy and other factors, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results to be expected for the full year.
Certain prior year data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on the overall results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any Registrant.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Goodwill</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>(in millions)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company</td>
    <td>$ 5,161</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company Gas:</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gas distribution operations</td>
    <td>$ 4,034</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gas marketing services</td>
    <td>$ 981</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Company Gas total</td>
    <td>$ 5,015</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if goodwill
impairment indicators exist.

(a) For Alabama Power and Georgia Power, reflects proceeds from the issuance of solid waste disposal facility revenue bonds in 2023 and 2022, respectively. For Southern Power,
reflects $17 million at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulting from an arbitration award held to fund future replacement costs and $3 million at December 31, 2023
held to fund estimated construction completion costs at the Deuel Harvest wind facility. See Note (C) under "General Litigation Matters - Southern Power" for additional
information related to the arbitration award. For Southern Company Gas, reflects collateral for workers' compensation, life insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
(b) Total may not add due to rounding.

Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. For any declines in market prices
below the WACOG considered to be other than temporary, an adjustment is recorded to reduce the value of natural gas inventories to market
value. Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to
year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end
are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated.
Southern Company Gas recorded no material adjustments to natural gas inventories for either period presented. Nicor Gas' inventory decrement at
March 31, 2024 is expected to be restored prior to year-end.

Alabama Power
Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 to the financial statements under
"Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a schedule to retire Mississippi Power's
40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 by the end of 2028.

Alabama Power currently expects to retire Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (300 MWs based on 60% ownership) by the end of 2028. Alabama
Power and Mississippi Power continue to evaluate operating conditions and business needs relevant to the anticipated retirement of Plant Greene
County Units 1 and 2. Additionally, the unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability
improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" herein for additional
information.

Georgia Power
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulated agreement among
Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors. In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following
requests:
•
•
•
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable
costs not to exceed the certified amount, which is projected to be approved by the Georgia PSC in the second half of 2024. In doing so, the
Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the
certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of
the additional costs.
Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December
2028.
Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.
Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems collocated with
existing Georgia Power-owned solar facilities, as well as the issuance of a request for proposals for an additional 500 MWs of battery
energy storage facilities.
Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.
On January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an Agreement for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction with Mitsubishi Power
Americas, Inc. and Black & Veatch Construction, Inc. to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Yates (Plant
Yates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter
2027, respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Transmission Asset Sales
On March 7, 2024, the FERC approved the sale of transmission line assets under the integrated transmission system agreement, with a net book
value of $230 million which is classified as held for sale at March 31, 2024 and included in other current assets on Southern Company's and
Georgia Power's balance sheets. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the sale, with a purchase price of $341 million, was completed resulting in a pre-
tax gain of approximately $110 million ($81 million after tax) to be recorded in the second quarter 2024.
Nuclear Construction
In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. In 2012,
the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with
electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin.
Georgia Power placed Unit 3 in service on July 31, 2023. On February 14, 2024, Unit 4 achieved self-sustaining nuclear fission, commonly
referred to as initial criticality, and, on March 1, 2024, the generator successfully synchronized to the power grid and generated electricity for the
first time. Georgia Power placed Unit 4 in service on April 29, 2024.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information on
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and cost recovery. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee
Borrowings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information on the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, including applicable
covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events.

Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power's net capital costs incurred through March 31, 2024 in connection with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and its approximate
proportionate share of additional capital costs to be incurred after March 31, 2024, including completion of testing and start-up for Unit 4 through
April 2024 and demobilizing the site after Unit 4's in-service date, is as follows:

(a) Includes approximately $610 million of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners, including $33 million of construction monitoring costs, and approximately $567
million of incremental costs under the cost-sharing provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined below). Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized
through AFUDC of approximately $440 million, of which $435 million had been accrued through March 31, 2024.

(b) Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.

Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $ 3.53 billion, of which
$3.52 billion had been incurred and $ 3.07 billion had been recovered through March 31, 2024.

Joint Owner Contracts
In September 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve a dispute regarding the cost-sharing and tender provisions
of the joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as amended (Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). Under the terms of the
agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are
incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project
capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the
current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs.

In October 2023, Georgia Power reached agreements with both OPC and Dalton to resolve its respective dispute with each of OPC and Dalton
regarding the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements. Under the terms of the agreements with OPC and
Dalton, among other items, (i) each of OPC and Dalton retracted its exercise of the tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) Georgia Power made payments immediately after execution of the agreements of $308 million and $17 million to OPC
and Dalton, respectively, representing payment for a portion of each of OPC's and Dalton's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
previously incurred, (iii) Georgia Power will pay a portion of each of OPC's and Dalton's further costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will be in an aggregate amount of
approximately $105 million and $6 million for OPC and Dalton, respectively, based on the current project capital cost forecast, and (iv) Georgia
Power will pay 66% of each of OPC's and Dalton's costs of construction with respect to any amounts above the current project capital cost
forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs.

The ultimate impact of these matters on the project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time.

Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit
3. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the common facilities construction costs continued to be
recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs ($ 22 million at March 31, 2024) as well as the remaining depreciation
expense ($28 million at March 31, 2024) until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The equity component of financing
costs ($38 million at March 31, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This
amount will be recognized in Georgia Power's income statements in the periods it is billable to customers.
After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $ 2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for
Unit 3 and common facilities, Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as
$647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency
Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately
5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Reductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately
$310 million in 2023 and $ 60 million in the first quarter 2024 and are projected to have additional negative earnings impact of approximately
$20 million in the second quarter 2024. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not
achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April
1, 2024, which is projected to result in an estimated negative impact to earnings of approximately $10 million (for one month) in the second
quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 in-service date. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's
NCCR tariff was eliminated and related financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general retail revenue requirements and collected through
retail base rates.
Mississippi Power
Performance Evaluation Plan
On March 15, 2024, Mississippi Power submitted its annual retail PEP filing for 2024 to the Mississippi PSC indicating no change in retail rates.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
On April 22, 2024, Mississippi Power submitted its annual ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2024 to the Mississippi PSC, which requested a
$5 million annual decrease in revenues. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
System Restoration Rider
On April 11, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which indicated no change in retail rates. Mississippi
Power's minimum annual SRR accrual was increased from $12 million to $ 13 million.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4
(268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs
based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia
Power. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements,
as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $ 485 million at March 31, 2024 and Mississippi Power is
continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at
retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to

be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with a 2020 Mississippi PSC order. The Plant Watson and Plant Greene
County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement.
The 2024 IRP is subject to review by the Mississippi PSC and is expected to conclude in the third quarter 2024.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
(C) CONTINGENCIES
See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits and other contingencies.
General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation
or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings not
specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have
a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants intend to dispute the allegations raised in and vigorously defend against the pending legal challenges discussed below; however,
the ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company and Mississippi Power
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $ 270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the
grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of
$137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout
certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. In 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an
agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the
abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of
the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of a civil investigation related to the DOE grants. In August 2023,
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia unsealed a civil action in which defendants Southern Company, SCS, and Mississippi
Power are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the False Claims Act by fraudulently inducing the DOE to disburse funds pursuant to the
grants. The federal government declined to intervene in the action. In October 2023, the plaintiff, a former SCS employee, filed an amended
complaint, again alleging certain violations of the False Claims Act. The plaintiff seeks to recover all damages incurred personally and on behalf
of the federal government caused by the defendants' alleged violations, as well as treble damages and attorneys' fees, among other relief. On
February 2, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on Southern
Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Alabama Power
In September 2022, Mobile Baykeeper filed a citizen suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama alleging that Alabama
Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond utilizing a closure-in-place
50

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
methodology violates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and regulations governing CCR. Among other relief requested,
Mobile Baykeeper sought a declaratory judgment that the RCRA and regulations governing CCR were being violated, preliminary and injunctive
relief to prevent implementation of Alabama Power's closure plan, and the development of a closure plan that satisfies regulations governing CCR
requirements. In December 2022, Alabama Power filed a motion to dismiss the case. On January 4, 2024, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice by the U.S. District Court judge. On February 1, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider.
In January 2023, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violations associated with Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond.
Alabama Power has affirmed to the EPA its position that it is in compliance with CCR requirements.
These matters could have a material impact on Alabama Power's financial statements, including ARO estimates and cash flows. See Note 6 to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of Alabama Power's ARO liabilities.
Georgia Power
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint, which was amended in December 2022, in the Superior Court of Fulton County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer has impacted groundwater and air, resulting in
alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a
medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. In December 2022, the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia granted Georgia Power's motion
to transfer the case to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia. In May 2023, the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia denied
Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In July 2023, the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia
denied the remaining motions to dismiss certain claims and plaintiffs that Georgia Power filed at the outset of the case. On March 11, 2024,
Georgia Power filed a motion to dismiss certain claims. On March 14, 2024, Georgia Power filed motions for summary judgment.
In October 2021, February 2022, and January 2023, a total of eight additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County,
Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries
and property damage. The plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. After Georgia Power
removed these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without
prejudice in November 2022 and January 2023. In May 2023, the plaintiffs in the cases originally filed in October 2021, February 2022, and
January 2023 refiled their eight complaints in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia. Also in May 2023, a new complaint was filed in the
Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer have impacted
groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including punitive
damages. Also in May 2023, Georgia Power removed all of these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The plaintiffs
are requesting the court remand the cases back to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia.
The amount of possible loss, if any, from these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three then-
serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to
include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon
including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper County energy facility prior to placing the Kemper County
energy facility into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by
customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that
51

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional
wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect
interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment
interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the
plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern
Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S.
Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the
proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to
disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending
motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to
vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In March 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the
claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. In May 2022, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings. In June 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the
complaint with prejudice, which was granted on March 15, 2023. On March 28, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In December 2023, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing the
plaintiffs' complaint against Mississippi Power, and the plaintiffs filed a petition for panel rehearing, which was denied on January 10, 2024. The
plaintiffs did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. This matter is now concluded.
Southern Power
In 2021, Southern Power and certain of its subsidiaries filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association against First Solar
for defective design of actuators on trackers and inverters installed by First Solar under the engineering, procurement, and construction agreements
associated with five solar projects owned by Southern Power and partners and managed by Southern Power. In 2023, Southern Power received an
award of approximately $36 million and filed for confirmation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Subsequently in 2023, First Solar filed a
motion to dismiss the confirmation and, in February 2024, filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Supreme Court of New York
County, New York. In March 2024, Southern Power dismissed the proceeding in Delaware without prejudice and filed an opposition to First
Solar's petition in the New York matter.
At March 31, 2024, $ 17 million of the award remains on the balance sheet as restricted cash and as a liability to fund future replacement costs. See
Note (A) under "Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash" for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases
of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up
affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received
authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs
through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or
other applicable state regulatory agencies.
Georgia Power's environmental remediation liability was $ 14 million at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Georgia
Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites

governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, and assessment and potential cleanup of such sites is expected.
Southern Company Gas' environmental remediation liability was $ 228 million and $222 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known former manufactured gas plant
operating sites.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental
remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of the applicable Registrants.
Other Matters
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
In April 2019, Bellsouth Telecommunications d/b/a AT&T Alabama (AT&T) filed a complaint against Alabama Power with the FCC alleging that
the pole rental rate AT&T is required to pay pursuant to the parties' joint use agreement is unjust and unreasonable under federal law. The
complaint sought a new rate and approximately $87 million in refunds of alleged overpayments for the preceding six years. In August 2019, the
FCC stayed the case in favor of arbitration, which AT&T has not pursued. The joint use agreement remains in effect. The ultimate outcome of this
matter cannot be determined at this time, but an adverse outcome could have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company
and Alabama Power. Georgia Power and Mississippi Power have joint use agreements with other AT&T affiliates.

(D) REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND LEASE INCOME
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources, some of which are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers, such
as leases, derivatives, and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Included in the wholesale electric revenues of the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power are revenues associated with affiliate transactions. These revenues are generated through long-term PPAs or short-
term energy sales made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Amounts related to these affiliate revenues are eliminated in
consolidation for Southern Company. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Revenues" and "Affiliate Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form
10-K for additional information. See "Lease Income" herein and Note (J) for additional information on revenue accounted for under lease and

Contract assets for Georgia Power primarily relate to retail customer fixed bill programs, where the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's
continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service
agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract liabilities for Georgia Power primarily relate to cash collections
recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements. Southern Company Gas' contract assets relate to work performed on an
energy efficiency enhancement and upgrade contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. Southern Company Gas receives cash
advances from a third-party financial institution to fund work performed, of which approximately $65 million had been received at March 31,
2024. These advances have been accounted for as long-term debt on the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Affiliate
Transactions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the construction contract. At March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $108 million and $91 million, respectively, and
contract liabilities of $188 million and $115 million, respectively, for outstanding performance obligations, all of which are expected to be
satisfied within one year.

Revenues recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2024, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023, were
$28 million for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants. Contract liabilities are primarily classified as current on the balance
sheets as the corresponding revenues are generally expected to be recognized within one year.

Remaining Performance Obligations
Southern Company's subsidiaries may enter into long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations
are satisfied over the contract term. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily relate to PPAS
whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable;
however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, these
contracts primarily relate to the U.S. General Services Administration contract described above. Southern Company's unregulated distributed
generation business also has partially satisfied performance

Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs
because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to
absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Solar had total assets of $ 5.6 billion, total liabilities of $ 407 million and $399 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.0 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to the
limited partner in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without
limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter.
Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, SP Wind had total assets of $ 2.1 billion, total liabilities of $ 196 million and $187 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $37 million and $38 million, respectively. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement,
distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its
members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash
distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited
liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities of each entity,
including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to partner consent and the
liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any
long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax equity investors
or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the arrangements are structured similar
to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out rights.
At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the other VIEs had total assets of $ 1.7 billion, total liabilities of $ 238 million and $230 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $742 million and $761 million, respectively. Under the terms of the partnership agreements,
distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional distributions require partner consent.

(a) Arrangement expiring in 2028 represents a $2.45 billion combined arrangement for Southern Company and Southern Power as borrowers. Pursuant to the combined facility, the
allocations between Southern Company and Southern Power may be adjusted.
(b) Does not include Southern Power Company's $75 million and $100 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, expiring in 2025 and 2026, respectively,
of which $8 million and $7 million, respectively, was unused at March 31, 2024. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit
facilities.
(c) Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $ 800 million of the credit arrangement
expiring in 2028. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2028 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted
for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2028, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas
may be adjusted. Nicor Gas is also the borrower under a $100 million credit arrangement expiring in 2024.
As reflected in the table above, in March 2024, Mississippi Power amended and restated a $ 125 million multi-year credit arrangement, which,
among other things, extended the maturity date from 2025 to 2027.
Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit
debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the
indebtedness of the individual company. The cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable
borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At March 31, 2024, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO
were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of
borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At March 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of
approximately $796 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at March 31,
2024, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $155 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds
outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months.

(UNAUDITED)
Alabama Power's $120 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due within one year on its balance sheets as they are not
covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate demand revenue bonds and fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed
within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the balance sheets as a result of available long-term committed credit.
Earnings per Share
For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is attributable to awards outstanding under
stock-based compensation plans and the Series 2023A convertible senior notes. EPS dilution resulting from stock-based compensation plans is
determined using the treasury stock method and EPS dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible senior notes is determined using the net
share settlement method. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Convertible Senior Notes" and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8
of the Form 10-K for additional information. Shares used to compute diluted EPS were as follows:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Three Months Ended March 31,</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"></th>

</thead>
<tbody>

<td style="text-align: center;"></td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Diluted shares</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1,100</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1,098</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
For the three months ended March 31, 2024, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS
calculation because the awards were anti-dilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no anti-dilutive shares.
For both periods presented, there was no dilution resulting from the Series 2023A convertible senior notes.
(G) INCOME TAXES
See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional tax information.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable
AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal
income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs.
Details of significant changes in the effective tax rate for the applicable Registrants are provided herein.
Southern Company
Southern Company's effective tax rate was 17.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 10.8% for the corresponding period in
2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes at Alabama Power
and higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by an increase in PTCs primarily at Georgia Power.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's effective tax rate was 20.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to an effective tax benefit rate of (0.8)% for
the corresponding period in 2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred
income taxes.

Georgia Power
Georgia Power's effective tax rate was 15.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 15.1% for the corresponding period in
2023. The effective tax rate increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by an increase in PTCs.
Southern Power
Southern Power's effective tax benefit rate was (57.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to (20.7)% for the corresponding
period in 2023. The effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to an increase in PTCs and lower pre-tax earnings.
(H) RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the exception of
employees at PowerSecure. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending December 31,
2024. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of management and highly
compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other
postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded
supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses.
See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power
products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market
approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and
overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market
data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected
payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present
value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair
value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's
expectation of future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value
Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note (J) for additional information on how
these derivatives are used.

For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred compensation trusts,
external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held
within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining
the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then
evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather
market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector
news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading
levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.

The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future
decommissioning. See Note 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to two of its acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make generation-based
payments to the seller, commencing at the commercial operation of each facility and continuing through 2026 and 2035, respectively. The
obligations are primarily categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using significant unobservable
inputs for the forecasted facility's generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount
rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected payments and any periodic change arising from
forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.

Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection facilities and
network upgrades constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating

facility to the transmission system. The obligations are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined
using observable inputs for the contracted amounts and reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects
the net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" primarily includes investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized as
Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds, and/or agency bonds.
At March 31, 2024, the fair value measurements of private market investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are
calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $179 million and unfunded commitments related to the
private market investments totaled $83 million. Private market investments include high-quality private equity funds across several market sectors,
funds that invest in real estate assets, and a private credit fund. Private market funds do not have redemption rights. Distributions from these funds
will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

(*) The carrying amount of Southern Company Gas' long-term debt includes fair value adjustments from the effective date of the 2016 merger with Southern Company. Southern
Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.
The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
rates available to the Registrants.
(J) DERIVATIVES
The Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as
counterparty exposure and risk management practices. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company
Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all
applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at
risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities
and are presented on a net basis. See Note (I) for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled
energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are
classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Energy-Related Derivatives
The Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes.
However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric
operating companies and certain of the
69

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state
PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate
price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited
exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in
energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to
price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-
traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the
intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in natural gas revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
*   Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating
    companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
    liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered
    through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
*   Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge
    anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in accumulated OCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same
    period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
*   Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized
    in the statements of income as incurred.

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common
and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative
unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying
goods being delivered.

At March 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over
which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date
for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Net<br>Purchased<br>mmBtu<br>(in millions)</th>
    <th>Longest<br>Hedge<br>Date</th>
    <th>Longest<br>Non-Hedge<br>Date</th>

    <td>93</td>
    <td>2027</td>
    <td>2028</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>(*)</sup> Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a
contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of 100.7 million mmBtu long natural gas positions and 7.8 million mmBtu short natural gas
positions at March 31, 2024, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(UNAUDITED)
In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply
contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas
subject to such a feature is 13 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 3 million mmBtu for Alabama Power, 5 million mmBtu for
Georgia Power, 2 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 3 million mmBtu for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax losses expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings for
the 12-month period ending March 31, 2025 are $20 million for Southern Company, $16 million for Southern Company Gas, and immaterial for
Southern Power.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives
related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or
losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item as the
earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income
statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of
income as incurred.

For cash flow hedges of interest rate derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains and (losses) expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to
interest expense for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2025 are $(17) million for Southern Company and immaterial for the traditional
electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas. Deferred gains and losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be
amortized into earnings through 2054 for Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power, 2052 for Alabama Power, and 2046 for
Southern Company Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives
related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including
foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are
accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded
directly to earnings on the same income

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
The Registrants enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and
payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master
netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting across product
lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are presented net to the extent that
there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, pre-tax gains on energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were
$47 million and $ 13 million, respectively, and reflected in cost of natural gas on the statements of income of Southern Company and Southern
Company Gas and were immaterial for the other Registrants.

Contingent Features
The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit
rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit,
or cash. At March 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

For Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and
the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
$66 million at March 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was
$17 million at March 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with
contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below
BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at March 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related
contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.

Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative
transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin
requirements. At March 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was $13 million for Southern Power and immaterial for Alabama
Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative
transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be
required to deposit cash into these accounts. At March 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $54 million.

The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally
enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to

(UNAUDITED)
cover potential credit exposure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to
post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or
letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to
entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the
counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas
may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable
Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting
and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded
on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary
businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services.
Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity
in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern
Company Gas. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were $92 million and $135 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas to the traditional
electric operating companies and Southern Power were immaterial for both periods presented. The "All Other" column includes the Southern
Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the
quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying
microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. All other inter-segment
revenues are not material.
Financial data for business segments and products and services for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments - gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas
marketing services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other.

Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution utilities that
construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.

Gas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership
interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of
Southern Company Gas. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.

Gas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar.

The "All other" column includes segments and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage and
fuels operations. The "All other" column included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to
the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies (Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The
primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and
the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional
electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other
complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas' reportable segments are gas distribution operations,
gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services. See Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information on
segment reporting. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially
all of their business is providing electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the
sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market. For additional information on the Registrants' primary business activities, see BUSINESS
- "The Southern Company System" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K.
The Registrants continue to focus on several key performance indicators. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company
Gas, these indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and
execution of major construction projects. Southern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree
Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating
Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system.
For Southern Power, key performance indicators include, but are not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to
evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers. In addition, Southern Company and the
Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator.
Recent Developments
Georgia Power
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status
Georgia Power placed Plant Vogtle Unit 3 in service on July 31, 2023 and placed Plant Vogtle Unit 4 in service on April 29, 2024 (each with
electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs), in each of which it holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the
total project capital cost forecast, including demobilizing the site after Unit 4's in-service date, is $10.8 billion. See Note (B) to the Condensed
Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information.
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Regulatory Matters
Georgia Power included in retail rate base $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base
items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4, pursuant to the approved Prudency Stipulation. Annual retail base revenues
increased approximately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR
tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.
Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia
Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024,
following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and related financing costs are included in Georgia
Power's general retail revenue requirements and collected through retail base rates.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters" herein for additional
information.
Integrated Resource Plan
On April 16, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's updated IRP (2023 IRP Update) as modified by a stipulated agreement among
Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors, which includes the authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs
from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power -
Integrated Resource Plan" herein for additional information.
Mississippi Power
On April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4
(268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs
based on 50% ownership), all by the end of 2028. The 2024 IRP is subject to review by the Mississippi PSC and is expected to conclude in the
third quarter 2024.
On March 29, 2024, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for an $8 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the
MRA tariff and requested an effective date of May 29, 2024. On April 19, 2024, Cooperative Energy challenged the new rates in a filing with the
FERC.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Mississippi Power" herein for additional information.
Southern Power
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Southern Power continued construction of the 200-MW Millers Branch solar facility and began
construction of the 180-MW second phase of the solar project. The second phase of the facility's output is contracted under seven 15-year PPAS
and commercial operation is projected to occur in the second quarter 2026. Southern Power also continued construction of the 150-MW South
Cheyenne solar facility. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 150-MW South
Cheyenne solar facility. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
At March 31, 2024, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for
facilities under construction) as the investment amount was 97% through 2028 and 89% through 2033, with an average remaining contract
duration of approximately 12 years.

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company in the first quarter 2024 was $1.1 billion ($1.03 per share) compared to $862 million
($0.79 per share) for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with
rates and pricing, colder weather in the first quarter 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, and sales growth and an increase in
natural gas revenues

from rate increases, partially offset by increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, and
income taxes.
Retail Electric Revenues
In the first quarter 2024, retail electric revenues were $3.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the
changes in retail electric revenues were as follows:

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023
primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 in retail rates at Georgia Power, base tariff increases at Georgia Power in accordance with its
2022 ARP, customer bill credits in 2023 at Alabama Power related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes, and an
increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues at Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia
Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Weather-
adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.0% primarily due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.8%
primarily due to increased customer usage. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.4% primarily due to increases in the lumber and paper sectors,
partially offset by decreases in the chemicals and primary metals sectors.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased $38 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due
to lower fuel and purchased power costs. Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel
expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one
or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA
capacity costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
additional information.

In the first quarter 2024, wholesale electric revenues were $571 million compared to $599 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to decreases of $18 million in energy revenues resulting from lower natural gas prices and $10 million in capacity
revenues primarily resulting from power sales agreements that ended in May 2023 at Alabama Power, partially offset by an increase related to
new capacity contracts at Georgia Power and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs at Southern Power.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than
solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on
investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company
system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern
Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or
decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge
and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the
energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated
from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.
Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated municipal and rural association sales under cost-based tariffs as well as
market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company
system's variable cost to produce the energy.

In the first quarter 2024, other electric revenues were $199 million compared to $190 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase
was primarily due to increases of $13 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales and $6
million in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in gains on the resale of gas at Alabama
Power and a $5 million decrease associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at Georgia
Power.
Natural Gas Revenues
In the first quarter 2024, natural gas revenues were $1.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the
changes in natural gas revenues were as follows:

</table>

Revenues from rate changes at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in
2023 primarily due to rate increases and a change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas.
Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due
to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather in the first quarter
2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do
not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
Revenues from gas marketing services decreased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to lower
commodity prices.

In the first quarter 2024, other revenues were $228 million compared to $217 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to increases in unregulated sales at Georgia Power primarily associated with energy conservation projects, power delivery

In the first quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion for the corresponding period in 2023.
The decrease was due to a $52 million net decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $46 million net decrease in the volume
of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have
a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.

Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Fuel
In the first quarter 2024, fuel expense was $1.0 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to a 7.7% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 6.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas,
and a 5.2% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, partially offset by an 18.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by
nuclear, a 17.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 14.1% increase in the average cost of nuclear per KWH generated, and a
13.0% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro.
Purchased Power
In the first quarter 2024, purchased power expense was $198 million compared to $242 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to a 21.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the
availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation, both at Alabama Power, partially offset by a 4.0% increase
in the average cost per KWH purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of
wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's
generation.

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities' rates include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount
expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas - Natural Gas Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural
gas distribution utilities represented 81% of the total cost of natural gas in the first quarter 2024.
In the first quarter 2024, cost of natural gas was $605 million compared to $898 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease
reflects lower gas cost recovery as a result of a 35% decrease in natural gas prices.

placed in service in July 2023 at Georgia Power and Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses at Alabama Power, $20 million in gains in 2023 from
sales of integrated transmission system assets at Georgia Power, a $16 million gain on the sale of spare parts in 2023 at Southern Power, and a $12
million increase in employee compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by decreases of $26 million in technology infrastructure and
application production costs, $18 million in expenses passed through to customers primarily related to bad debt and energy efficiency programs at
Southern Company Gas, and $10 million related to the injuries and damages reserve primarily at Alabama Power and Southern Company Gas.

| $126 | 129.9 |

In the first quarter 2024, income taxes were $223 million compared to $97 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a $42 million decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes at Alabama Power,
partially offset by the generation of $19 million of advanced nuclear PTCs at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K and Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.
Alabama Power
Net Income
First Quarter 2024 vs. First Quarter 2023

| $78 | 30.6 |

Alabama Power's net income in the first quarter 2024 was $333 million compared to $255 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with customer bill credits in 2023 related to the flowback of certain excess
accumulated deferred income taxes, an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues, and colder weather in the Alabama Power service territory in
the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. These increases to income were partially offset by an increase in income tax
expense related to a decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Retail Revenues
In the first quarter 2024, retail revenues were $1.57 billion compared to $1.38 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the changes
in retail revenues were as follows:

| Weather | | 40 | 2.9 |
| Fuel and other cost recovery | | 15 | 1.1 |
| Retail revenues | $ 184 | 13.3% |

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023
primarily due to customer bill credits in 2023 related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes as well as an increase
in Rate CNP New Plant revenues. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional
information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales were relatively flat in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023.
Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 0.6% primarily due to a decrease in customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH
sales increased 2.5% primarily due to an increase in customer usage. Industrial KWH sales decreased 0.8% primarily due to a decrease in the
primary metals sector.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a result
of higher recoverable fuel costs.

Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs
associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and
do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

In the first quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $85 million compared to $141 million for the corresponding period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 59.5% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May
2023 and a 49.5% decrease in the price of energy due to lower natural gas prices.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also
included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above
Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.

by a 31.6% decrease in the price of energy due to lower gas prices.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy
revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

Fuel

In the first quarter 2024, fuel expense was $331 million compared to $308 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to a 28.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, an 8.3% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal,
and a 15.0% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by a 12.5% decrease in the
average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements.

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates

In the first quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $52 million compared to $101 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 55.5% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the
availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation.

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023
primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 in retail rates and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Weather-
adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.8% primarily due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 4.1%
primarily due to increased customer usage and customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 1.8% primarily due to
increases in the primary metals, lumber, and paper sectors, partially offset by decreases in the chemicals, electronics, and pipeline sectors.
Fuel revenues and costs are allocated between retail and wholesale jurisdictions. Retail fuel cost recovery revenues decreased in the first quarter
2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 due to lower fuel and

</table>
In the first quarter 2024, wholesale revenues were $58 million compared to $31 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was
primarily due to a $20 million increase related to new capacity contracts and a $9 million increase related to the volume of KWH sales associated
with higher market demand, partially offset by a $6 million decrease related to the average cost per KWH sold due to lower Southern Company
system fuel and purchased power costs.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both
capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and
provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices,
the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have
a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia
Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. Energy revenues related to these transactions do
not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

In the first quarter 2024, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $710 million compared to $731 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease of $37 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a
net increase of $16 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel
revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Fuel Cost

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
In the first quarter 2024, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $140 million compared to $123 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The increase for the first quarter 2024 was primarily due to an increase of 26.3% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power and
other Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources, partially offset by a decrease of 8.8%
in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to lower natural gas prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern
Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power - Affiliates
In the first quarter 2024, purchased power expense from affiliates was $181 million compared to $206 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 13.9% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Southern Company system units generally
dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources, partially offset by capacity purchased through a new PPA with Mississippi Power. See
Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan" for additional information.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within
the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023
primarily due to the amortization of certain regulatory assets that ended in December 2023.
Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Weather-
adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales increased 4.7% and 7.4%, respectively, primarily due to increased customer usage. Industrial
KWH sales decreased 1.7% primarily due to decreases in the petroleum and transportation sectors.
Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the first quarter 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily as a result
of lower recoverable fuel costs. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of
wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings
for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel
expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8

In the first quarter 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $59 million compared to $68 million for the corresponding period in
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $6 million decrease associated with MRA customers largely due to lower recoverable fuel costs and a
$4 million decrease associated with changes in power supply agreements.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of
Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service
territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power
provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi
under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for
resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable
cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff" in Item 8

Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities,
and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it
may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power
into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a
return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy
demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market

prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage,
and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied
by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity
revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the
energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations
and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions,
equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

In the first quarter 2024, total operating revenues were $473 million, reflecting a $35 million, or 6.9%, decrease from the corresponding period in
2023. The change in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:
•	PPA capacity revenues increased $8 million, or 7.1%, primarily due to an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs.
•	Non-PPA revenues decreased $48 million, or 44.4%, primarily due to a $51 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term
sales.

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs.
Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a
significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power
from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern
Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company
system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled
with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased
power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.
Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:

Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design,
which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also
utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations
and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. Therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact.

During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution
systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. In addition, because of a rate design change affecting volumetric rates
ordered by the Illinois Commission in Nicor Gas' 2023 rate case, additional revenues are expected in the Heating Season, with a corresponding
decrease expected in revenues in the second and third quarters of each year. This change will affect the comparison of the prior year revenue for
the impacted quarters. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas and bad debt expense, are incurred
relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including
receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company
Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of annual
results and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

Natural Gas Revenues
In the first quarter 2024, natural gas revenues were $1.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the corresponding period in 2023. Details of the
changes in natural gas revenues were as follows:

First Quarter 2024 vs.
First Quarter 2023
| | (change in millions) | (% change) |
|---|---|---|
| Rate changes | $ 152 | 8.1% |
| Gas costs and other cost recovery | (291) | (15.5) |
| Gas marketing services | (9) | (0.5) |
| Other | (20) | (1.1) |
| Natural gas revenues | $ (168) | (9.0)% |

Revenues from rate changes increased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to rate increases and a
change in timing of revenues at Nicor Gas.

Revenues from gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due
to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather when compared to
the corresponding period in 2023. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.

Revenues from gas marketing services decreased in the first quarter 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due lower
commodity prices.
Cost of Natural Gas

First Quarter 2024 vs. First Quarter 2023
| | (change in millions) | (% change) |
|---|---|---|
|  | $(293) | (32.6) |

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in
cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented
81% of the total cost of natural gas in the first quarter 2024. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS – "Southern Company Gas - Cost of Natural Gas" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and "Natural Gas Revenues" herein for additional
information.

In the first quarter 2024, cost of natural gas was $605 million compared to $898 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease
reflects lower gas cost recovery as a result of a 35% decrease in natural gas prices.

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory
agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity
to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest
expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a
straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution
utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general
economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other
mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in
customer consumption, including weather changes within typical

ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K for additional information.
In the first quarter 2024, net income increased $81 million, or 36.7%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023, as described further
below:
*   Operating revenues decreased $155 million primarily due to lower gas cost over recovery, partially offset by rate increases and a change in
    timing of revenues at Nicor Gas. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas.
*   Operating expenses decreased $275 million primarily due to a $273 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and
    lower volume sold compared to 2023, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher
    compensation and benefit expenses, and higher revenue taxes.
*   Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $10 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt.
*   Income taxes increased $32 million primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.

Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note (E)
to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.

Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that
were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local
distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of
hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.
In the first quarter 2024, net income increased $15 million, or 30.0%, when compared to the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to retail
margins and decreases in cost of natural gas.

All Other
All other includes a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate
operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing
arrangements. All other included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
In the first quarter 2024, net income increased $5 million when compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase was primarily related
to decreases in operating expenses and income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in operating revenue.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The level of the Registrants' future earnings
depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or
distributing natural gas, as described further herein.

For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for
the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth,
stringent environmental standards, including CCR

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new
electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of
higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, recent trends driving
projected growth in electricity consumption including the increasing digitization of the economy and growth in data centers, an increase in
industrial activity in the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and continued electrification of transportation. These growth
opportunities could be offset by energy efficiency trends in each market.
Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be affected by higher-than-expected inflation that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated policy responses of governments and central banks. In response to elevated inflation levels, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest
rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years. The actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have helped to slow the rate of inflation and
curtail economic activity. Although target levels of inflation have yet to be achieved, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated its current intention to
pause future rate increases and evaluate rate cuts depending on the current economic data. The shifting economic policy variables and weakening
of historic relationships among economic activity, prices, and employment have increased the uncertainty of future levels of economic activity
which will directly impact future energy demand and operating costs. Weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing or declining
energy sales. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during
the first three months of 2024.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters
of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy
through the development, construction, or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters;
customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully
remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which
could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and
operational limitations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Income Tax
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding the Inflation Reduction Act's expansion of the availability of federal ITCs and
PTCs and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for information regarding construction projects.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas
pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities'
ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to
projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and
improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects;
customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the
U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an
impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern
Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices,
primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations
to earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand
for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term
basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of
natural gas production.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition;
developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy
conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and
material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand.
Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may
be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of
potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-
utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination
thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility
industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial
condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development
arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations
Water Quality
On April 25, 2024, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of the final rule revising the Steam Effluent Guidelines (ELG Final Rule), which will
establish more stringent limits for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion residual leachate to be met no
later than December 31, 2029. The ELG Final Rule maintains the existing rule's permanent cessation of coal subcategory and the existing rule's
voluntary incentive program and adds a new cessation subcategory which allows units to cease coal combustion by December 31, 2034 as
opposed to meeting the new more stringent requirements. The ELG Final Rule will also establish limitations for legacy wastewater which will be
effective 60 days from the date of publication. The ultimate impact of the ELG Final Rule cannot be determined at this time; however, it may
result in significant compliance costs.

On April 25, 2024, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of the final legacy CCR surface impoundments rule which will establish two new
categories of federally regulated CCR, legacy surface impoundments and CCR management units (CCRMU). The rule will require legacy surface
impoundments and CCRMUs to meet certain existing regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within 42 months after
the effective date of the final rule for legacy surface impoundments and within 54 months after the effective date of the final rule for CCRMUS.
The final rule also includes an option to defer closure of previously closed units where certain criteria have been met. The EPA is also finalizing
an alternative provision for closure by removal. The ultimate impact of the final rule cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in
significant compliance costs.

Greenhouse Gases
On April 25, 2024, the EPA released pre-publication copies of the final GHG rules for existing fossil fuel-fired steam electric generating units and
new fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation facilities, which will require GHG limits for subcategories of both new
and existing units. The new rules do not include standards for existing fossil fuel-fired combustion turbines and combined cycle generation
facilities, which will be deferred to a future rulemaking. Requirements for existing coal-fired units are based on technologies such as carbon
capture and sequestration (CCS) and natural gas co-firing. States have 24 months after the rule's publication to submit state plans for existing
units. The rule allows states to consider remaining useful life and other factors to specify alternative, unit-specific emissions limits and
compliance timelines for existing units, as needed to address reliability and other concerns. Existing source compliance will begin as early as
January 1, 2030, depending on the subcategory. The final rule incorporates some limited reliability mechanisms including a provision for short-
term grid emergencies and a "reliability assurance mechanism" that allows for a one-time, up to one year, extension of existing coal unit retirement
dates specified in an approved state plan. The standards for new combustion turbines include subcategories for low, intermediate, and base load
operations. Compliance with new source standards begins when the unit comes online, with requirements for CCS beginning on January 1, 2032.
The EPA also simultaneously repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The ultimate impact of the final rules cannot be determined at this time;
however, it may result in significant compliance costs.
Regulatory Matters
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, OVERVIEW - "Recent Developments" herein, and Note (B) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern
Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and
improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws
and regulations.
The traditional electric operating companies are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. Major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. See
Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Georgia Power
Integrated Resource Plan" for information regarding Georgia Power's construction of three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates.

Income Tax Matters
See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL - "Income Tax Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
Inflation Reduction Act
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have nuclear generating facilities that may qualify to generate and claim PTCs under the Inflation Reduction
Act beginning in 2024, subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Georgia State Tax Legislation
On April 18, 2024, the State of Georgia enacted tax legislation that reduces the corporate income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.39% effective for the
2024 tax year. This legislation will reduce the amount of Southern Company's and certain subsidiaries' income tax expense in the State of Georgia,
reduce existing state accumulated deferred tax liabilities, and increase regulatory liabilities at Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas. The
impacted Registrants are still evaluating the impacts of this legislation, which is not expected to have a material impact on net income. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows,
and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory
and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes
(B) and (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes (B) and (C) to the Condensed
Financial Statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – ACCOUNTING POLICIES in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of
the Registrants' critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as recently issued accounting standards.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the
financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the Registrants' results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are
significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Overview" in Item 7 of the Form
10-K for additional information. The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at March 31, 2024. The Registrants intend to continue
to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity
needs. See "Cash Requirements," "Sources of Capital," and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
At the end of the first quarter 2024, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $71.74 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $29.19 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 246%, compared to $70.12, $28.83, and
243%, respectively, at the end of 2023. Southern Company's common stock dividend for the first quarter 2024 was $0.70 per share compared to
$0.68 per share in the first quarter 2023.
Cash Requirements
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for a description of the Registrants' significant cash requirements.
The Registrants' significant cash requirements include estimated capital expenditures associated with their construction programs and, for the
traditional electric operating companies, operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery. The fuel cost under recovery balances are
primarily the result of higher than forecasted prices for natural gas and purchased power. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information.
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of
numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and
regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and
replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or
regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal
weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance
that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned
acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy.
See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plan" herein for information regarding Georgia
Power's 2023 IRP Update, which includes incremental cash requirements for capital expenditures through 2027 of approximately $700 million.
Southern Power's construction program includes the Millers Branch and South Cheyenne solar projects. The remaining aggregate construction
costs for these projects are expected to be between $500 million and $620 million. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this time. See Note (K) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "Southern Power" herein for additional information.
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See
"Financing Activities" herein for information on changes in the Registrants' long-term debt balances since December 31, 2023.
Sources of Capital
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Sources of Capital" in Item 7 of
the Form 10-K for additional information. Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings
from financial institutions, and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern
Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings.
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which
were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from
Southern Company. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. Georgia Power intends to utilize a mix of
senior note issuances, short-term floating rate bank loans, and commercial paper issuances to continue funding operating cash flows related to fuel
cost under recovery.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2024, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the
Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary
Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax
benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology
to allocate partnership gains and losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Southern Power's tax equity funding for existing tax
equity partnerships was immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, up to its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to
make money pool loans to affiliates. At March 31, 2024, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.9 billion. This
restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially
impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term
debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it
matures. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at March 31, 2024 for the applicable
Registrants:

At March 31, 2024

|                                                    | Southern Company | Mississippi Power (in millions) | Southern Company Gas |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Current liabilities in excess of current assets | $ 915            | $ 115                          | 51                   |

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines
of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize
equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.
Bank Credit Arrangements
At March 31, 2024, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:

At March 31, 2024

|                               | Southern Company parent | Alabama Power | Georgia Power | Mississippi Power | Southern Power(a) (in millions) | Southern Company Gas(b) | SEGCO | Southern Company |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------ | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------ | :---- | :--------------- |
| Unused committed credit | $ 1,998                 | $ 1,350       | $ 1,726       | $ 275            | $ 600                           | $ 1,598                    | $ 30 | $ 7,577          |

(a) At March 31, 2024, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $15 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries
are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b) Includes $798 million and $800 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as
needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or
decrease the lending commitments thereunder.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to certain revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating
companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. At March 31, 2024, outstanding variable rate demand
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies with allocated liquidity support totaled approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of
approximately $796

million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at March 31, 2024, Alabama
Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $155 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are
required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Alabama Power's $120 million of fixed rate revenue bonds are classified as securities due
within one year on its balance sheets as they are not covered by long-term committed credit. All other variable rate demand revenue bonds and
fixed rate revenue bonds required to be remarketed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term debt on the balance sheets as a result of
available long-term committed credit.
See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "Bank Credit
Arrangements" for additional information.
Short-term Borrowings
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity
support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its
commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-term bank term loans are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. Details of the
Registrants' short-term borrowings were as follows:

Except as otherwise described herein, the Registrants used the proceeds of debt issuances for their redemptions and maturities shown in the table
above, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Subsidiary Registrants also used the
proceeds for their construction programs.
In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, the Registrants plan to continue,
when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Credit Rating Risk
At March 31, 2024, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or
terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.

There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain Registrants to
BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel
transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, services at Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

(*) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances
without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $106 million of
cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at March 31, 2024.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could
require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be
provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the
Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.
