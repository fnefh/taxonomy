PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and
Southern Company Gas.
The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are each operating public utility companies providing
electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.
Southern Power Company is also an operating public utility company. The term "Southern Power" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its
subsidiaries, while the term "Southern Power Company" when used herein refers only to the Southern Power parent company. Southern Power develops, constructs,
acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia,
and Tennessee - through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the
distribution of natural gas.
Southern Company also owns SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SCS, the system
service company, has contracted with Southern Company, each of the Subsidiary Registrants, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or
allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general executive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance,
treasury, legal, tax, information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern Company power pool
transactions. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the
public and provides fiber optics services through its subsidiary, Southern Telecom, Inc. Southern Linc's system covers approximately 122,000 square miles in the
Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, which invests in various projects. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the
Southern Company system's nuclear power plants and is currently managing construction of and developing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia
Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers.
See "The Southern Company System" herein for additional information. Also see Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding recent
acquisition and disposition activity. Segment information for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas is included in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8
herein. Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each operate with one reportable business segment, since substantially all of their business is providing
electric service to customers. Southern Power also operates its business with one reportable business segment, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market.
The Registrants' Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are made
available on Southern Company's website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2
herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the
respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the
transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see
"Territory Served by the Southern Company System - Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into for reasons related to reliability or
economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which
provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance

schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies
have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the
traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. On November 9, 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange
Market (SEEM) began service. SEEM, whose members include the traditional electric operating companies and many of the other electric service providers in the
Southeast, is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the
energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. The FERC's orders related to SEEM have been appealed. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system,
or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric
facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other
operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric
operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the
Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern
Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate
sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC
regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch,
and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation -
Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information.
Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based
rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions
including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts
for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs,
municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating
facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the
traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks
by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the
wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and
construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the
majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - "Business Activities" in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has
various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue power
generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with
various partners, totaled 12,501 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,121 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See
"Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power pool.
A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern
Power being the controlling partner and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power had eight tax equity
partnership arrangements where the tax equity

investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax
equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under
contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With
the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage
ratio at December 31, 2022 was 96% through 2027 and 90% through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, approximately 44% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 43% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated
counterparties, and 11% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type,
referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer.
Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides
that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power
resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically
viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt
year and to provide a return on investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have
a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed
price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the
level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.
Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.
Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be
replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA
could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.

Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities.
Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas
marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an "all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
disclosure, including storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021,
Southern Company Gas' other businesses also included wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein
for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions, including the sale of Sequent and the sale and pending sale of the remaining facilities within the
storage operations business.
Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains 77,591 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14
storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves
approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.
Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the
Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest
natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in

Item 8 herein for information concerning financing programs.
Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear for Alabama Power and
Georgia Power. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - RESULTS OF
OPERATION - "Southern Company - Electricity Business - Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
RESULTS OF OPERATION under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information
regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2021 and 2022.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the
Southern Company system. For 2023, SCS has contracted for 659 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 11 years. In addition to natural
gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies,
transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2023 coal burn requirements. These
agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes
have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are
proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the
timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are
currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable
regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power - Environmental Accounting Order," "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans," and "Mississippi Power - Integrated
Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information, including the Southern Company system's electric generating mix and plans to retire or convert to natural gas
certain coal-fired generating capacity.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication
with remaining terms ranging from one to 12 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the
Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and
Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel
Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for
substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Natural Gas
Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas. Demand increases beginning in
2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility, which has been exacerbated by pipeline constraints and increased exports. The Henry Hub
price averaged $6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current forecasts for 2023 are approximately $3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond indicate expectations, absent
unforeseen developments, that prices will modestly increase. The potential for price increases, similar to those in 2022, and high volatility remains. Procurement plans for
natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company
Gas operates. Southern Company Gas

purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, under asset management
agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines
that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under
FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the
natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased
storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the sale of Sequent.

**Competition**

*Electric*

The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors. Further technological advancements or the implementation of policies in support of alternative energy sources may result in further competition.

Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.

As of December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2022, Alabama Power purchased approximately 68 million KWHs from such companies. The related costs were immaterial.

As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 39 small IPPs. During 2022, Georgia Power purchased 6.1 billion KWHs
from such companies at a cost of $298 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure
to meet minimum capacity output. During 2022, Georgia Power purchased 399 million KWHs at a cost of $37 million from these facilities.
As of December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi
Power purchases any excess generation. During 2022, Mississippi Power did not make any such purchases.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition
from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets
in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder
makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment.
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:
*   changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;
*   general economic conditions;
*   energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;
*   legislation and regulations, including certain bans on the use of natural gas in new or existing construction and electrification initiatives;
*   the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and
*   technological or regulatory changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.

Southern Company Gas has natural gas-related programs that generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural
gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
Seasonality and Demand
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power sales of some electric utilities peak in
the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions, the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the
summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the
Registrants in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when
weather conditions are milder.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "General" and - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "Southern
Company Gas - Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality
on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively.
Regulation
States
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state
regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates,
service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See
"Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in
wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act.
The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The

FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and
prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect
to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2022, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power
generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially
owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan
Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several
conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama
Rivers Alliance also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by
the FERC.
In November 2021, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa River. The current Harris Dam project
license will expire on November 30, 2023.
In 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee River upon their license expirations on
December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro fleet capacity.
In December 2021, Georgia Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River. The current Lloyd Shoals project
license will expire on December 31, 2023.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of 903,000 KW installed capacity. In
December 2021, OPC, as an agent for co-licensees of the project, filed a notice of intent with the FERC to relicense the project. An application to relicense the project is
expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2024. See PROPERTIES - "Electric - Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 for Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2034-2060 for Georgia Power's
projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the
original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the
Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages
to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result
in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and
materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and
safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. On August 31, 2022, Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its
intent in 2025 to seek to renew the plant's licenses for an additional 20 years (through 2054 and 2058 for Units 1 and 2, respectively). The NRC licenses for Alabama
Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin.
On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the COL for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and
start-up testing to begin. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations
See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters" in Item 7
herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning
environmental laws and regulations impacting the Registrants.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories.
Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate
customer charges. Rates for commercial service are also of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and
minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage.
Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers,
subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs
are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or
on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power
through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as
approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual,
formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also see "Integrated Resource Planning"
herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-
affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an
affiliate.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under
requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi
Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are
likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers
vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to
generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function
of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue
fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural
gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as
those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.

Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable
mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future
generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet transition.

Alabama Power
Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information
that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama
Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources
sufficient to meet expected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new
generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business. Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP
to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun
Generating Station. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022. During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be
placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for
additional information.

Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a
combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia
Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs
may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. On July 21, 2022, the
Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors
and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" and " - Rate Plans" in Item 8
herein for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information
on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing
costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Mississippi Power
Triennially, Mississippi Power must file an IRP with the Mississippi PSC, as well as an update at approximately the mid-point of the three-year cycle. The IRP must
include long-term plans to best meet the needs of electric utility customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering
transmission needs. The IRP filing is not intended to supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new
generating resources. Mississippi Power's most recent IRP was filed in 2021 and the next IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2024. Mississippi Power must also file an
annual report on energy delivery improvements, the latest of which was filed on December 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power -
Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

</table>

(*) Numbers are rounded to 100s.

All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1% of total employees.

Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries have policies, programs, and processes to
help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that
diversity is important to provide different perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's
diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally through its Compensation and Talent
Development Committee, oversees these efforts. Southern Company system management utilizes its "Moving to Equity" initiative that focuses on five key areas: talent,
work environment, supplier inclusion, civic engagement, and community investment and social justice. This initiative demonstrates the Southern Company system's
commitments, highlights key results, and tracks progress on long-term goals.

Southern Company system management supports employee resource groups, diversity councils, mentoring programs, and inclusion teams to provide formal networks of
colleagues that can help promote belonging, improve employee retention, and support development. At December 31, 2022, people of color and women represented
30% and 26%, respectively, of the Southern Company system's workforce.

Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce. Southern Company system
management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools, technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill
many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The
addition of external hires augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the Southern
Company system's talent pipeline.

The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a comprehensive total rewards strategy with three measurable categories: physical,
financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries, annual incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare,
and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan
which provides a competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in these plans. There are
differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for
additional information. At December 31, 2022, the average age of the Southern Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company
system was 15 years. Turnover rate, calculated as the percent of employees that terminated employment with the Southern Company system, including voluntary and
involuntary terminations and retirements, divided by total employees, was 8.9%.

Southern Company system management is committed to developing talent and helping employees succeed by providing development opportunities along with purposeful
people moves as part of individual development plans and succession planning processes. The Southern Company system has multiple development programs, including
programs targeted toward all

employees, high potential employees, first-level managers, managers of managers, and executives. Additionally, Southern Company system management strives to
deliver consistent needs-based training and solutions as workplace needs evolve.

Southern Company system management believes the safety of employees and customers is paramount. The Southern Company system seeks to meet or exceed applicable
laws and regulations while continually improving its safety technologies and processes. The Southern Company System Safety and Health Council, which includes
leaders from each Registrant, works collectively across the Southern Company system to provide safety leadership, share learning, work collaboratively to address
safety-related issues, and govern the consistency of safety programs. The safety programs are focused on the prevention and elimination of life-altering events, serious
injuries, and fatalities. These programs include continuous process improvements to put critical controls in place to prevent serious injuries, promote learning, and
implement appropriate corrective actions. In 2022, the Southern Company system had zero fatalities and a serious injury rate of 0.05, which represents the number of
incidents per 100 employees (calculated by taking the number of serious injuries multiplied by 200,000 workhours and divided by the total employee workhours during
the year). A serious injury is one that is life-threatening or life-changing for the employee. Serious injury examples, as defined by applicable safety regulators, include
fatalities, amputations, trauma to organs, certain bone fractures, severe burns, and eye injuries.

The Southern Company system continues to provide essential services to customers while adapting to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Southern Company
system has implemented applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal, state, and local officials, and established protocols for required work on customer
premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's critical operations, while also emphasizing employee, customer,
and community safety.

The Southern Company system also has longstanding relationships with labor unions. The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Nuclear, and the natural gas
distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW, which generally apply to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. These
agreements cover wages, benefits, terms of the pension plans, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. The Southern Company
system also partners with the IBEW to provide training programs to develop technical skills and career opportunities.

At December 31, 2022, approximately 31% of Southern Company system employees were covered by agreements with unions, with agreements expiring between 2024
and 2026.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
in Item 7, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC, the following factors should be carefully considered in
evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially fromthose expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. The risk factors discussed below could adversely affect a
Registrant's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, as well as cause reputational damage.
UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal, state, and local governmentalregulation, including with respect to rates. Compliance
with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern
Company and its subsidiaries.
Laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Southern Company system offers, protection of critical electric infrastructure assets,
transmission planning, reliability, pipeline safety, interaction with wholesale markets, and relationships with affiliates, among other matters. The Registrants' businesses
are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if a Registrant is found to be noncompliant.
The profitability of the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' businesses is largely dependent on their ability, through the rates
that they are permitted to charge, to recover their costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. The traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their costs, including a reasonable return on invested capital, through their retail rates, which must be approved by the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Such regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which
recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required. Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the
traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline
investments must be approved by the FERC. Changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies' ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC
market-based rate authority could affect wholesale rates. Also, while a small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through wholesale electric tariffs, the
majority are collected through retail rates. Transmission planning could be impacted by FERC policy changes.
The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to Southern Company or
any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation, the imposition of additional regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed
for noncompliance with existing laws or regulations could influence the operating environment of the Southern Company system and may result in substantial costs.
The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROS are significant.
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, GHGs,
water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. Compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital
and operating costs including the settlement of AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. There is no assurance,
however, that all such costs will be recovered. The Registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant.
The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act and water quality under the Clean Water Act. The EPA
and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the disposal and management of CCR at power plant sites. The cost estimates for
AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation
and discount rates, and the potential compliance methods. The traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically update their ARO cost estimates.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances could require the Southern Company
system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and former operating sites, and locations subject to contractual obligations.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements has
occurred throughout the United States. This litigation has included, but is not
I-15

# Page 26 of 330

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
limited to, claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, alleged exposure to regulated substances,
and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.
Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern Company system. The Southern Company
system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of
requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may
result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, operational changes, or changing fuel sources
for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental
compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot
continue to be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and
natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have
the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.
The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction
goals.
Concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable assets could further increase.
Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant.
The Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a scenario planning process that is used
to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and
external sources, which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a
30-year horizon. In 2022, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO2 prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO2 emitted and
escalating over the 30-year horizon.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. However, the
ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and
advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal
challenges.
Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but not limited to, the imposition of a
carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be
tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building
sectors may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions, designed
to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the
prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.
Southern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG
emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of
low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including
low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and making the necessary
related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions,
including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to
support outcomes leading to a net zero future.

**OPERATIONAL RISKS**
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adverselyaffected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their
facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are
many risks that could affect these matters, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by
environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions
and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and
transportation facilities, inability to maintain reliability consistent with customer expectations as the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power
transition their generating fleets in support of the Southern Company system's net zero goal, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber
security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, supply chain
disruptions, inflation, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events,
political unrest, or other similar occurrences.
**Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters, cyber intrusions, physical attacks,
and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Powerand which may present potential
exposures in excess of insurance coverage.**
Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts for the operation of, four
existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented approximately 22% and 27% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama
Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners,
is managing the construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial risks
such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the
ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of
decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the
amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and significant capital expenditures
relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.
Damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage, including statutorily required nuclear
incident insurance.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear facilities. In the event of non-compliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC
orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make
substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama
Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of
new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the United States, including
facilities owned and operated by third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.
In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs.
**Transporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.**
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and
mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The
location of pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally,
pipelines and underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could
result in substantial monetary penalties.

Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and storage facilities and the transmission and
distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their
respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner
or at all. These risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect
on the Southern Company system.
Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to human error, natural
disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely
manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or more key technology systems,
networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure,
which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures
due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a
heightened risk of cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure. Various
regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing
in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Additionally, these risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.
The Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems
and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to
technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations
from these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of
technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable
information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to
third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the
Registrants. The Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their
systems.
Internal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy delivery service failures, compromise
sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data
may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.
Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they could materially
increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks.
The Southern Company system may not be able to obtainadequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required to operate the traditional electric
operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern Company Gas' natural gas customers.
SCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company system's generation fleet from a diverse set
of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from
different regions of the country. This daily supply is complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver
this daily supply and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines. Disruption in the
supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting
fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and
operating costs, and the ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers.

The Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which has the potential to impact, among other things, the
traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation. The robust growth in supply allowed natural gas prices to moderate and remain below
$3 per mmBtu in recent years; however, demand increases beginning in 2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility. The Henry Hub price
averaged $6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current forecasts for 2023 are approximately $3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond indicate expectations, absent
unforeseen developments, that prices will modestly increase. With the majority of natural gas production being from shale gas formations, any limitation on shale gas
production would be expected to have a material impact on the supply availability as well as the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to
Mexico and those from LNG facilities, has grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's natural
gas markets.
The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their electric generating capacity. The
counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers and/or
railroads may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural
disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase additional coal at higher
prices or limit coal generation, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates if deemed to be imprudently incurred. The railroad industry has been
experiencing labor shortages, which has led to delays in coal deliveries. As coal-fired generating facilities are retired, the demand for coal is expected to continue to
decline. As a result, railroads may commit fewer resources to coal transportation, which could increase these risks.
Whereas fuel oil directly provides only a small portion of the Southern Company system's annual generation, its importance to the reliability of the Southern Company
system's generation portfolio continues to grow. Over the last few years, related cost increases and supply chain challenges have become more common and may increase
the risk of reliability challenges.
In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water, which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid
in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to
operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs.
The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and SouthernPower depend in part on sales under PPAs, the success of
which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and
renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related generating capacity.
Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs with Southern Power's top three customers comprising approximately 22% of
Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The traditional electric operating companies have entered into PPAs with non-affiliated parties
for the sale of generating capacity.
The revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the credit evaluations undertaken and
contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual
exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.
Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or
on what terms any renewals may be made. If one of these Registrants is unable to replace expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to
sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease
operations. The failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under construction, could result
in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.
Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in customer demand for energy could
negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers those investments and earns a return for
investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy
counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and
produces power at a competitive cost.
Customers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings.
Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs.

New technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable assets could change the type of
assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation
storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller-
scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of distributed generation
by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic
incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in
technology, which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation.
It is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.
Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing
services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most
notably in Illinois and Georgia.
If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their
respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution facilities could be reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric
generation business models could change the risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could
be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.
**The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.**
The Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate
replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges
such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction
projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees
to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years and challenges competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully-
remote work options. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure
to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the
future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses.
**Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact operations.**
The Southern Company system's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment, materials, and other resources. The delivery of
components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern Company system's operations has been impacted by ongoing domestic and global
supply chain disruptions. International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate global supply chain disruptions. These
disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction,
maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments.
Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment, and other needed commodities, and these inflationary increases may
continue. While inflation in the United States had been relatively low in recent years, its impact became more significant during 2021 and continued in 2022. Uncertainty
around inflationary impacts continues to increase in the near-term outlook for economic activity. Rapid inflation or other economic factors may negatively affect the
timely recovery of costs.
**The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue.**
The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or extended disruptions to capital markets,
further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged reductions in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the
Registrants, including, but not limited to, new or prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of
goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment, and further challenges to the
development, construction, and/or operation of the Subsidiary Registrants' facilities, including electric

generation, transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and access to funds from financial institutions
and capital markets.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein.
**CONSTRUCTION RISKS**
The Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recover their
investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental
standards and goals.
The businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements, including transmission, distribution,
and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution
facilities for Southern Company Gas. These expenditures also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to certain
existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system. The traditional electric operating companies also
are in the process of closing ash ponds to comply with the CCR Rule and, where applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its
strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution
systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long-term in nature and in some cases may include the
development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed.
Completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or may occur, including labor costs,
availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays,
increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory
action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety
programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters including, for Plant Vogtle Unit 4,
inspections and the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related investigations, reviews, and approvals by the NRC necessary to
support NRC authorization to load fuel; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational performance;
continued challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and
geological conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a
result of project delays.
If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel construction of a project, it may not be able to
recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs
associated with the closure and/or abandonment of the construction project.
In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority in connection with projects under
construction, including rights to change ownership allocations and/or cause the cancellation of a construction project under certain circumstances. Any failure by a
partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction.
Southern Power participates in partnership agreements with respect to a majority of its renewable energy projects and Georgia Power jointly owns Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 with other co-owners. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding other
jointly-owned facilities.
If construction projects are not completed according to specification, a Registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs, and
reduced net income. Furthermore, construction delays associated with renewable projects could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives.
Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and may not be recoverable
through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues. The largest construction
project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Southern Company and Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to
income of $3.3 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) through December 31, 2022 to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete
1-21

construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for
information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in
Item 8 herein for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional electric
operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may
require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related
retirement obligations.
FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS
The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the natural gas operations of
Southern Company Gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs.
The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs, which could
increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy, and/or make electric generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems
less competitive. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand,
which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated
gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and/or
purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas
costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and
adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.
The consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and
technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of
financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.
Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes
in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have
banned the use of natural gas in new construction.
Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution
utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency.
Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual
conservation efforts.
In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past.
However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available
methods and experience to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency
mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.
The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result
in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant.
Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather
conditions are milder.
Volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the
generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
1-22

Power, and the natural gas distribution and underground storage facilities of Southern Company Gas, which is likely to negatively impact revenue. The Subsidiary
Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states that
could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and
restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities. These volatile weather events may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring procurement
of additional power at wholesale prices, or create other grid reliability issues.
In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any natural disaster or other catastrophic
event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The traditional
electric operating companies from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. Additionally, the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs.
In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a Subsidiary Registrant's service territory or otherwise affecting its customers may result
in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs.
Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks, including risks not originally
contemplated.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions, dispositions, and investments in the past and may continue to do so. Such actions cannot be
assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value
through various transactions, including acquisitions or sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value
through various transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry
into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Additionally,
Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in existing pipelines, most of which are operated by third parties. If one of these agents fails to perform in a
proper manner, the value of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of its investment. In addition, Southern Company Gas is
required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions may not be completed on acceptable
terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of
efficiencies, or the reduction of risk.
These transactions also involve risks, including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected funds or return on capital or other
anticipated benefits; they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business
or operational risks; they may not be successfully integrated into the acquiring company's operations, internal control processes, and/or accounting systems; the due
diligence conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately evaluate the likelihood or
quantify the exposure from identified risks; they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash flow; they may involve retained obligations in connection with
transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions that subject Southern Company or its subsidiaries to additional risk; Southern Company or the
applicable subsidiary may not be able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions; expected benefits of a transaction
may be dependent on the cooperation, performance, or credit risk of a counterparty; minority investments in growth companies may not result in a positive return on
investment; or, for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered
through regulated rates may not be recoverable.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of
these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to meet their ongoing and future financial obligations.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own. Substantially all of Southern Company's and
Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a
certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and,
for Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries and the ability of those
subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective
subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including
among others, debt service. In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital
I-23

contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations,
including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital
at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.
There are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital
structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The
Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or
financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit
ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including
potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease,
and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating
downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional
restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.
Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation
assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new
pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future
to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution
facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns,
efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution
utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at
all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the
recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern
Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating
companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended.
The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power
is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed
the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase
capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because
regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric
operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of
costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price
PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.

Here's a Markdown version of the provided text, with tables formatted as HTML.  Since there were no tables in the original text, there are no HTML tables in the output.

The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital markets and financial institutions.

The Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity for access to low cost money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, continued increases in interest rates, bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility and disruption, either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility companies, future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health of the utility and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Furthermore, some financial institutions may be limited in their ability to provide capital to the Registrants as a result of such financial institution's investment criteria, including criteria related to GHG.

Additionally, since a portion of the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's indebtedness bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR, uncertainty related to its announced phase out and alternative reference rates may adversely affect financing costs. Any replacement benchmark rates may be relatively new, fundamentally different from LIBOR, and/or more volatile than other benchmark or market rates. SOFR has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United States, although the SOFR market is not yet fully developed.

If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.

Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.

The debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.

The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ACCOUNTING POLICIES - "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Shareholder activism could cause Southern Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of Southern Company's business strategy, and impact Southern Company's stock price.

Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management's and Southern Company's board's attention and resources. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to Southern Company's future, adversely affect the Southern Company system's relationships with its employees, customers, regulators, or service providers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, Southern Company may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters,

including for third-party advisors. Southern Company's stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks, and
uncertainties of any shareholder activism.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.
The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an increased focus on climate issues, among
other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may
have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual
amount of loss incurred.
The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in thenormal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively
impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures
and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a
result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and
procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for
hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and
pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the
valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in the underlying
assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
See Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of operations.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount and long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset
group's carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2022, goodwill was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas,
respectively.
In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill or long-lived
assets become impaired, the affected Registrant may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. See Notes
1, 7, 9, and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.
Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
None.

(j) Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO, an operating public utility company. Alabama Power and Georgia Power are each entitled to one-
half of SEGCO's capacity and energy. Alabama Power acts as SEGCO's agent in the operation of SEGCO's units and furnishes fuel to SEGCO for its units. See Note 7 to the financial statements
under "SEGCO" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power - Environmental Accounting Order," "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans," and "Mississippi Power - Integrated
Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity included in the table above.
Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants and other important units of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and
SEGCO are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management of each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and
are substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose.
Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC. The line extends from Plant Daniel to
the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC is paying a use fee through 2024 covering all expenses and the amortization of the original cost. At
December 31, 2022, the unamortized portion was approximately $1 million.
Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine that was intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the operator of the mine, has a legal
obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the
Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under "Other Matters - Mississippi Power - Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
In conjunction with Southern Company's 2019 sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and NextEra Energy agreed to negotiate a mutually acceptable revised operating
agreement for Plant Daniel. On July 12, 2022, the co-owners executed a revised operating agreement. The dispatch procedures in the revised operating agreement for the
two jointly-owned coal units at Plant Daniel resulted in Mississippi Power designating one of the two units as primary and the other as secondary in lieu of each company
separately owning 100% of a single generating unit. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase its co-owner's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided
that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. See Notes 2 and 3 under "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" and "Other
Matters - Mississippi Power - Plant Daniel," respectively, in Item 8 herein for additional information on Plant Daniel.
In 2022, the maximum demand on the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO was 37,035,000 KWs and occurred on June 15,
2022, which was also the maximum all-time demand. This amount excludes demand served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The reserve margin
for the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO in 2022 was 20%.

Jointly-Owned Facilities

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power at December 31, 2022 had undivided interests in certain generating plants and other related facilities with non-
affiliated parties. The percentages of ownership of the total plant or facility are as follows:

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power have contracted to operate and maintain the respective units in which each has an interest (other than Rocky
Mountain) as agent for the joint owners. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants.
In addition, Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases totaling $41 million, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant
Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds
issued to finance such ownership interest. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner currently holding the same undivided ownership
interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein.
Titles to Property
The traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are
owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron
Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as
liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan
guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and
obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Assets Subject to Lien" and Note 8 to the
financial statements under "Long-term Debt" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of
their principal plants as tenants in common. See "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8
herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on
rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right
easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-
of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The
following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas.
Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein
for additional information.
Distribution and Transmission Mains
Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of
distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company
Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 77,591 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that
generally provide for perpetual use.
Storage Assets
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately
135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the
normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate
the risk associated with seasonal price movements.
Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern
Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are
used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Business Activities
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company
Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the
traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other
complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric
service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at
market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions
including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily
with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In
general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new
facilities.
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural
gas distribution utilities in four states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee - and is also involved in several other other complementary businesses. Southern
Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments - gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services,
which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets - and one non-reportable segment, all other.
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial,
governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total
shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition,
and liquidity.
Recent Developments
Alabama Power
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved the following items:
Alabama Power's petition for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station.
The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and the related costs are being recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, which reflected an increase in annual revenues
of $34 million, or 0.6%, effective with November 2022 billings.
An increase to Rate ECR effective with August 2022 billings, which resulted in an increase of approximately $310 million annually. The approved changes in the
Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact the related operating cash flows.
Modifications to Rate NDR.
An accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the previous Rate NDR authority related to
reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds $35 million. At December
31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued $166 million to the reserve.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

On September 23, 2022, the FERC authorized Alabama Power to use updated depreciation rates from its 2021 depreciation study effective January 2023. The updated
depreciation rates are expected to result in an approximately $500 million increase in annual depreciation expense.
On November 1, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR of approximately $500 million annually effective with December 2022 billings. The
approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery.
On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations for Rate CNP Compliance for 2023 which resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately
$255 million, or 3.7%, effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates.
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to
certain depreciation rates. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings.
In addition, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated deferred income
taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately $318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the Rate CNP Depreciation increase.
The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in service in November 2023. At December 31, 2022,
associated project expenditures totaled approximately $518 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory
liability of $62 million. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.

**Georgia Power**

*Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status*

Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power currently holds a
45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end
of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024, respectively, is $10.6 billion.

On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that
the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was
completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023, during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain
equipment and component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends
on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational
challenges. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4
is now projected to be placed in service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential
impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels,
particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost
increases.

During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $307 million were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated
with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the
equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost
forecast by $125 million to replenish construction contingency and $9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in
its nineteenth VCM order. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of
these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded
pre-tax charges to income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million
after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC
to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power -
Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters."
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender
provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Joint Owner Contracts"). The
other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender
provisions.
On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not
accept these purported tender exercises. On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton
County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. On
July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a
declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and
tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits.
On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and
tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain
its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project
capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost
forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. On October 4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of settlement and voluntary dismissal of
the pending litigation described above, including Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022, Dalton dismissed its related complaint. Georgia Power
recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of approximately
$440 million ($328 million after tax), $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax), respectively,
associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with
these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve
the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to
income of up to approximately $345 million associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current
project capital cost forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast
through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of
tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service.
The ultimate impact of these matters on the construction schedule and project capital cost forecast and related cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be
determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
2022 ARP
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, including estimated net rate increases totaling $216 million, $377 million, and $403 million
effective January 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, respectively. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Rate Plans - 2022 ARP"
for additional information.
Integrated Resource Plans
On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the
Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the 2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved several requests, including the
following:
Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), which occurred on August 31, 2022, and Plant Scherer Unit 3
(614 MWs based on 75% ownership) by December 31, 2028, as well as the

reclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values of these units and any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventories upon
retirement.
Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028. See Note 7 to the
financial statements under "SEGCO" for additional information.
Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its ash ponds and landfills.
The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to the 2025 IRP.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.
# Mississippi Power
On June 7, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2022, resulting in an annual increase in revenues of approximately
$18 million, or 1.9%, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2022.
On August 26, 2022, the FERC accepted an amended shared service agreement (SSA) between Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under
which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually through 2035. At
December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving approximately 400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide
100% of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA. Mississippi Power expects to
remarket this capacity, including the potential development of future arrangements with Cooperative Energy.
On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a $23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff Cooperative
Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request
effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.
On November 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by $25 million annually effective with the first billing
cycle of February 2023 and an additional $25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer
approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel
recovery balance. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability reserve for the purpose of deferring
generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future year, under certain conditions. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power
accrued $25 million to the reliability reserve.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.
# Southern Power
During 2022, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the remaining 40 MWs of the Tranquillity battery energy storage facility (72 MWs total)
and the remaining 15 MWs of the Garland battery energy storage facility (88 MWs total).
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under
contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With
the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage
ratio at December 31, 2022 was 96% through 2027 and 90% through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
# Southern Company Gas
On August 1, 2022, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base rate revenues of $69 million,
including $15 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with
infrastructure, technology, and workforce development. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2023, a ROE of 10.35%,
and an equity ratio of

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
53.2%. Rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase in the third quarter
2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On September 7, 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an
aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022 and
completion of the sale of the California facility is expected later in 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company Gas
recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2022 related to the facilities. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $53 million effective January
1, 2023.
On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $321 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including
$59 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test
year for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2024, a return on equity of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%. Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an
additional $32 million under three proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois Commission is
expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Key Performance Indicators
In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.8 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the
traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited
to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and
the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for
information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "Southern Company Gas - Operating Metrics" for additional information on
Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.
The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring
customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys
to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate RSE" and "Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional information on Alabama Power's
Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity
return.
Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to
evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company
Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $3.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 47.3%, from 2021. The increase was primarily due to
a $1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing,
warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter 2022, and sales growth, and increases in natural gas revenues from base rate increases and continued infrastructure
replacement, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and higher interest expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Basic EPS was $3.28 in 2022 and $2.26 in 2021. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $3.26 in 2022 and $2.24 in
2021. EPS for 2022 and 2021 was negatively impacted by $0.04 and $0.01 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8
to the financial statements under "Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock - Southern Company" for additional information.
Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.70 in 2022 and $2.62 in 2021. In January 2023, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 68 cents per
share. For 2022, the dividend payout ratio was 82% compared to 116% for 2021.

</table>

Retail electric revenues increased $3.3 billion, or 22.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The
increase in rates and pricing in 2022 was primarily due to increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with
variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage. In addition, Alabama Power
made a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021. These increases were partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the
allowed retail ROE range in 2022.

Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of
purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income.
The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs,
storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" for additional information. Also see "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of
changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.
Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>$ 3,641</td>
    <td>$ 2,455</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In 2022, wholesale electric revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 48.3%, as compared to 2021 due to increases of $1.1 billion in energy revenues and $75 million in capacity
revenues. Energy revenues increased $744 million at Southern Power primarily due to fuel and purchased power increases compared to 2021 and an increase in the
volume of KWHs sold primarily associated with natural gas PPAs. Energy revenues increased $367 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due
to higher natural gas and coal prices. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in natural gas PPAs at Southern Power and increased
opportunity sales at Alabama Power due to warmer weather.

Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs)
have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed
costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company
system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's
generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity
charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a
result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be
impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-
regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin
above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.
Other Electric Revenues
Other electric revenues increased $29 million, or 4.0%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $54 million in transmission revenues
primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, $18 million in outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenues
associated with higher natural gas prices at Alabama Power, and $11 million in rent revenues at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a decrease
of $32 million resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for
retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and a decrease of $17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to
customers, all at Georgia Power.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as
follows:

<tr>
<th></th>

(*) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from
normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it
allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy
sales increased 1.8 billion KWHs in 2022 as compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.2%
and 2.0%, respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 largely due to customer growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer
usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.5% in 2022
when compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in the pipeline and paper sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the chemicals sector.
See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.
Other Revenues
Other revenues increased $13 million, or 4.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $10 million in unregulated lighting sales at
Alabama Power and $7 million associated with energy conservation projects at Georgia Power.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units.
Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.

(a) Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $8.4 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 69.0%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a
$2.8 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $653 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on
net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the
counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.
Fuel
In 2022, fuel expense was $6.8 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 70.4%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 72.3% increase in the average cost
of natural gas per KWH generated, a 28.8% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, an 11.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, and
a 9.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased Power
In 2022, purchased power expense was $1.6 billion, an increase of $615 million, or 62.9%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 38.2% increase in
the volume of KWHs purchased and a 30.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as
compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $459 million, or 9.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with increases of $247
million in transmission and distribution expenses, $95 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled outage and maintenance costs, $25 million for a
reliability reserve accrual in 2022 at Mississippi

Power, and $22 million in amortization of cloud software. The transmission and distribution increase was primarily due to increased line maintenance, as well as the net
impact of Alabama Power accruals of $166 million to the reliability reserve in 2022 and an incremental $65 million to the NDR in 2021. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $76 million, or 2.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional plant in service.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $63 million, or 5.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in municipal franchise fees
associated with higher retail revenues at Georgia Power.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183 million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up
of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
Gain on dispositions, net decreased $20 million, or 33.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a net decrease of $39 million in gains at Southern Power related
to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission
system assets at Georgia Power in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $31 million, or 17.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with an
increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction at Alabama Power and an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC at Georgia
Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $99 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $54 million related to
higher average outstanding borrowings and $43 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $89 million, or 20.8%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a $68 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement
benefits income and a $23 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $33 million increase in charitable donations at the traditional electric operating
companies. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $629 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges
associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit
carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for
additional information.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Substantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, in
2022 as compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to $28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's tax equity partners in 2022, largely
offset by $23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15
to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.

Seasonality of Results
During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected
to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services'
operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating
expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating
results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2022, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the
Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 67% and 66%, respectively. For 2021, the percentage of operating revenues and net
income generated during the Heating Season were 70% and 102%, respectively.

Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and Chattanooga Gas and
continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher
volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate
revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs.
Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas
distribution utilities. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
The change in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services was due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing
services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.

Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities rates include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect
net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas -Natural Gas Cost Recovery" for additional
information. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation
costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher
volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $104 million, or 9.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Excluding $66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021,
other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and
benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at the natural gas distribution utilities, $31 million primarily
related to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the
natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for
additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue tax
expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through
directly to customers and have no impact on net income.
Impairment Charges
In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two
natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments increased $98 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84
million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $16 million related to higher
average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $106 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale
totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of $110 million resulting from the
sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially
offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes
7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Business Activities
Southern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which
provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which
invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services
to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.

Alabama Power
Alabama Power's 2022 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.34 billion, representing a $102 million, or 8.2%, increase from 2021. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in Alabama Power's service territory in 2022
compared to 2021, and sales growth. Also contributing to the increase in net income were increases in other operating revenues associated with transmission revenues and
unregulated lighting sales, as well as an increase in AFUDC, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs associated with a reliability reserve
accrual and higher interest expense.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Retail revenues increased $971 million, or 17.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in fuel and other cost recovery, as well as an increase in revenue driven by a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather
in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth in all major retail classes.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate ECR," " - Rate RSE," and " - Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information. See "Energy
Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and weather.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the
NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to
the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:

      <th>2022</th>
      <th>2021</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Capacity and other</td>
      <td>$ 213</td>
      <td>$ 173</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Energy</td>
      <td>513</td>
      <td>204</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Total non-affiliated</td>
      <td>$ 726</td>
      <td>$ 377</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $349 million, or 92.6%, as compared to 2021 due to a $309 million increase in energy revenues
primarily related to higher natural gas prices and a $40 million increase in capacity revenues primarily related to increased opportunity sales due to warmer weather in
2022 as compared to 2021.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and
the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern
Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do
not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.
In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $31 million, or 18.1%, as compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflects a 64.7% increase in the price of
energy due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 28.1% decrease in KWH sales due to the availability of lower cost Southern Company system resources
compared to Alabama Power's generation.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this
energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.
In 2022, other operating revenues increased $53 million, or 14.5%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $19 million in transmission revenues primarily due
to open access transmission tariff sales, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices, $10 million in unregulated lighting sales,
and $9 million in rent revenues.

(*) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from
the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful
because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial
plans.

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to
changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. In 2022, weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales were flat compared to 2021. Industrial
KWH sales increased 0.5% as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the forest product and pipeline sectors.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated
companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units.
Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

(a) Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 64.8%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $648 million
increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $390 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through
Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine
whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate ECR" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $1.8 billion in 2022, an increase of $605 million, or 49.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 77.2% increase in the average cost
of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 22.4% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, a 24.1% increase in the volume
of KWHs generated by natural gas, and a 9.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 13.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs
generated by nuclear as a result of the extension of a planned outage.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $441 million in 2022, an increase of $220 million, or 99.5%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a
90.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 10.3% increase in the average cost per
KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's
generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power - Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $360 million in 2022, an increase of $213 million, or 144.9%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a
58.3% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 54.4% increase in the average cost per
KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern
Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $200 million, or 11.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $147 million
in transmission and distribution expenses primarily associated with a $166 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022, partially offset by an incremental $65 million NDR
accrual in 2021, as well as other line maintenance, $33 million in generation expenses primarily associated with maintenance and Rate CNP Compliance-related
expenses, and $17 million in customer accounts, customer service, and sales expenses primarily associated with labor and bad debt expense. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power - Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and " - Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $16 million, or 1.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $28 million in depreciation related to an
increase in additional plant in service, largely offset by a decrease of $16 million in amortization of regulatory assets associated with the retirement of certain generating
plants.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $18 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures
related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction, as well as an increase in capital expenditures related to hydro production. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $42 million, or 12.4%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $36 million related to
higher average outstanding borrowings and $12 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $37 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in interest income and non-service cost-related
retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $51 million, or 13.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease in state tax credits. See Note 10to the
financial statements for additional information.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's 2022 net income was $1.8 billion, representing a $1.2 billion, or 210.4%, increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1
billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as well as an increase in retail revenues associated with rates and pricing,
warmer weather in Georgia Power's service territory compared to 2021, and sales growth. These increases were partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and
maintenance costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information on the construction of Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4.

Retail revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 27.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase
in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in
accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage, partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE
exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for additional information.

See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in 2022.
Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"
for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Wholesale revenues from power sales were as follows:

|                       |      | 2022 |      | 2021 |
| :-------------------- | :-: | :--- | :-: | :--- |
|                       |      |      |     |      |
|                       |      |      | (in millions) |      |
| Capacity and other    | $    | 48   | $   | 63   |
| Energy                | $    | 187  | $   | 134  |
| Total                 | $    | 235  | $   | 197  |

In 2022, wholesale revenues increased $38 million, or 19.3%, as compared to 2021 largely due to an increase of $78 million related to the average cost of fuel primarily
due to higher natural gas and coal prices, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in KWH sales associated with lower market demand and a $10 million decrease in
capacity revenues due to the expiration of a non-affiliate PPA in 2021.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy
components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on
investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia
Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel
costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia
Power's variable cost of energy.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is
generally sold at marginal cost.

In 2022, other operating revenues decreased $28 million, or 4.8%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of $32 million resulting from the termination of a
transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing
tariffs, and decreases of $17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers and $16 million from power delivery construction
and maintenance contracts. These reductions were largely offset by increases of $27 million associated with unregulated outdoor lighting sales and energy conservation
projects, $20 million in open access transmission tariff sales, and $4 million from maintenance services provided to integrated transmission system owners.

Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as
follows:

|                       |      |                       |      | 2022                               |      |                               |

(*) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from
normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because
it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to
changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales increased 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively, in 2022
when compared to 2021 primarily due to customer

growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-
pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 2.4% primarily due to increases in the pipeline, lumber, paper, and
electronic sectors, partially offset by decreases in the textiles and chemicals sectors.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit
cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.
Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

</tbody>
</table>

(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 61.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was due to an increase of $1.7
billion related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of $148 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through
Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 71.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 65.9% and 37.8% in the
average cost per KWH generated by natural gas and coal, respectively, and a 10.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $856 million in 2022, an increase of $224 million, or 35.4%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an
increase of 26.5% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices and an increase of 25.4% in the volume of KWHs
purchased primarily due to higher demand.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's
generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Purchased Power - Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $1.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $542 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an
increase of 75.3% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company
system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $136 million, or 6.1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $96 million in
distribution expenses primarily associated with line maintenance, $45 million in certain compensation and benefit expenses, $11 million in amortization of cloud
software, and $9 million in maintenance costs at corporate and field support facilities, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system
assets, a decrease of $15 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled generation outages partially offset by environmental projects, and a $12 million
reduction in billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners largely resulting from a terminated transmission service agreement.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $59 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $46 million associated with additional plant in
service and $12 million associated with amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" and " - Rate Plans - 2019 ARP" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $51 million, or 10.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in municipal franchise fees resulting from
higher retail revenues.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183 million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect revisions to the total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $13 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures
subject to AFUDC.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $64 million, or 15.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects approximately $39 million
related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $24 million related to higher interest rates. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Sources of
Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $34 million, or 23.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits
income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2022, income tax expense was $370 million compared to income tax benefit of $168 million for 2021, a change of $538 million. The change was primarily due to
higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation
allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction"
and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

Total retail revenues for 2022 increased $60 million, or 6.9%, compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in revenues in accordance with new PEP rates that became
effective for the first billing cycle of April 2022, an increase in fuel and other cost recovery revenues primarily as a result of higher recoverable fuel costs, and an
increase in customer usage. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.
See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.
Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under
these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel
costs include fuel and purchased power

expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2022</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total non-affiliated</td>
    <td>$ 252</td>
    <td>$ 230</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $22 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs and an increase in
base revenue from MRA customers primarily due to increased demand as a result of weather impacts in 2022.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and
the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern
Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do
not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a
municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these
wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any
changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in
sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to
produce the energy. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $272 million, or 144.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $243 million
associated with higher fuel costs, primarily for natural gas, and $29 million associated with higher KWH sales due to lower cost available Mississippi Power resources as
compared to the available affiliate company generation.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are
made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at
marginal cost.
In 2022, other operating revenues increased $18 million, or 62.1%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $13 million in unregulated sales associated with
power delivery construction and maintenance projects and $4 million in open access transmission tariff revenues.

(*) Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from
normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Mississippi Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful
because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial
plans.

Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to
changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH salesdecreased 1.8% compared to 2021 due to a decrease in customer
usage resulting from increased activity outside the home as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased
1.4% primarily due to customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.6% primarily due to increases in the petroleum, pipeline, and transportation sectors.

See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units.
Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.
Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

</table>

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $789 million in 2022, an increase of $293 million, or 59.1%, as compared to 2021. Theincrease was primarily due to a $266
million increase related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $27 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through
Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - Fuel Cost Recovery" and Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information.
Fuel expense increased $276 million, or 58.8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 52.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a
29.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 27.5% increase in the average cost of coal per KWHs generated, and a 3.9% increase in the volume of
KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased power expense increased $16 million, or 62.0%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 77.2% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased,
partially offset by an 8.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in
accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $63 million, or 20.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $25 million reliability
reserve accrual in 2022 and increases of $12 million related to unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects, $7 million associated with storm
reserve accruals, $6 million in employee compensation and benefits, $4 million in transmission and distribution line maintenance, and $4 million associated with the
Kemper County energy facility primarily related to sales and use taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power - System Restoration Rider" and
" - Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters - Mississippi Power" for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $16 million, or 76.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily dueto an increase of $11 million in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes
associated with new PEP rates that became effective in April 2022, as well as an increase of $5 million due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Southern Power
Net income attributable to Southern Power for 2022 was $354 million, an $88 million increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues driven by
higher market prices of energy and new natural gas PPAs and higher income associated with tax equity partnerships, partially offset by higher other operations and
maintenance expenses, gains from contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, and a tax benefit due to a change in state
apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in 2021.

Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues
from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale
market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's
customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include
fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are
generally accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either
purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility
and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy
generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

Operating revenues for 2022 were $3.4 billion, a $1.2 billion, or 52.0% increase from 2021. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:
*   PPA capacity revenues increased $43 million, or 10.5%, primarily due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs.
*   PPA energy revenues increased $810 million, or 61.8%, primarily due to a $656 million increase in sales under existing natural gas PPAs resulting from a $539 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold. Also contributing to the increase was a $164 million increase in sales associated with new natural gas PPAs, net of contractual expirations.
*   Non-PPA revenues increased $294 million, or 63.0%, due to a $338 million increase in the market price of energy, partially offset by a $42 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.

Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

</table>

In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $984 million, or 104.6%, compared to 2021. Fuel expenseincreased $812 million, or 101.2%, primarily due
to a $719 million increase associated with the average cost of fuel and a $93 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense
increased $172 million, or 123.7%, largely due to a $168 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $59 million, or 14.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $42 million
related to generation maintenance and outage expenses and $10 million in transmission expenses to serve new natural gas PPAs, partially offset by $6 million related to
the allocation in 2021 of uncollected settlements by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri.
Loss on Sales-Type Leases
In 2021, a $40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities' PPAs, $26 million of
which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by
Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2022, gain on dispositions, net decreased $39 million, or 95.1%, compared to 2021 primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method
investments in 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2022, income tax expense was $20 million compared to income tax benefit of $13 million for 2021, a change of $33 million. The change was primarily due to higher
pre-tax earnings in 2022 and a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in the first quarter 2021,
partially offset by higher wind PTCs in 2022. See Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements under "Income Taxes" and "Effective Tax Rate," respectively, for additional
information.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
In 2022, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to $28 million in higher
HLBV loss allocations to tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by $23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage
facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
Operating Metrics
Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.
Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand
for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization
and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern
Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.
The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition
from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for
natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.
Seasonality of Results
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas
usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to
peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt
expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet
items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern
Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated
in the table below.

Net Income
Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2022 was $572 million, an increase of $33 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2021. Net income increased $88 million
at gas pipeline investments primarily as a result of a 2021 impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and $58 million at gas distribution operations
primarily due to base rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement, largely offset by after-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling $99 million
related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities. The 2021 results also included $107 million of net income from Sequent, including a $92 million after-tax gain and $85
million of additional tax expense resulting from its July 1, 2021 sale. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2022 were $6.0 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion, or 36.1%, increase compared to 2021. Details ofoperating revenues were as follows:

|                                                              |      | 2022       |

| Operating revenues - prior year                              | $    | 4,380      |
| Estimated change resulting from                               |      |            |
| Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes    |      | 252        |
| Gas costs and other cost recovery                            |      | 1,468      |
| Gas marketing services                                       |      | 15         |
| Wholesale gas services                                       |      | (187)      |
| Other                                                        |      | 34         |
| Operating revenues current year                              | $    | 5,962      |

Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and Chattanooga Gas and continued investment
in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural
gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations
from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs
recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See
"Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
The changes in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services were due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021 See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Heating Degree Days
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather changes. Southern Company Gas also
uses hedges for the majority of any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas
marketing services; therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information for Illinois
and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

|           | Normal(*) | 2022       | 2021       | 2022 vs. normal colder | 2022 vs. 2021 colder |
| :-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
|           |           | (in thousands) |           |                        |                        |
| Illinois  | 5,690     | 5,708      | 5,326      | 0.3%                   | 7.2%                   |

Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income
from gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas -Natural Gas Cost Recovery" for additional information. Cost of
natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation
costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
In 2022, cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher
volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.
Volumes of Natural Gas Sold

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $104 million, or 9.7%, compared to 2021. Excluding $66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021,
other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and
benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at gas distribution operations, $31 million primarily related
to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2022, depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the
natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for
additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
In 2022, taxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue tax
expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through
directly to customers and have no impact on net income.
Impairment Charges
In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two
natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. Sie Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
In 2022, earnings from equity method investments increased $98 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84
million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
In 2022, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $16 million related to
higher average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2022, other income (expense), net increased $106 million compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale
totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million at gas distribution operations primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See
Note 11 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Income Taxes
In 2022, income taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of $110 million resulting from the
sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially
offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes
7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

(*) As a result of the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was no longer a reportable segment in 2022. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the
states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of
natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs,
and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.

With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable
rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for
natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather
derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities'
service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

In 2022, net income increased $58 million, or 14.1%, compared to 2021. Operating revenues increased $1.6 billion primarily due to higher gas cost recovery, rate
increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of
natural gas. Operating expenses increased $1.5 billion primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices compared to 2021, a
$52 million increase in compensation and benefit expenses, and a $34 million increase in depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service. The increase in
operating expenses also includes increases of $83 million in costs passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt expenses and revenue taxes. Other
income and expense increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest expense, net of amounts
capitalized increased $22 million primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments. Income taxes increased $25 million primarily due to higher
pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.

Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, Dalton Pipeline, and PennEast Pipeline. In 2022, net
income increased $88 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to the
PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various
states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution
and transportation services. Gas marketing

services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk nanagement tools, to partially mitigate
potential weather impacts.
In 2022, net income increased $6 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $163 million increase in operating revenues as a result of
higher commodity prices, colder weather, and higher sales to commercial customers, partially offset by a $155 million increase in operating expenses primarily due to
$149 million in higher cost of natural gas and an increase of $3 million in income taxes as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.
All Other
All other includes natural gas storage businesses, a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various
corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. See Note
15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding agreements by certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas to sell two natural gas
storage facilities.
In 2022, net income decreased $12 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling approximately $131 million
($99 million after tax) related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities, largely offset by $84 million of additional tax expense as a result of the sale of Sequent in 2021,
an increase in operating revenues of $17 million primarily related to higher demand fees and favorable hedge gains at the natural gas storage businesses and higher sales
from the renewable natural gas business, lower depreciation in 2022, and an increase in charitable contributions in 2022. See Note 10 to the financial statements and
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
General
Prices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution service provided by the natural gas distribution utilities to
retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through
various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory
mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric
operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates - Utility Regulation" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities described in Note 15 to the financial
statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities,
challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of
prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including
CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating
plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity
usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost
recovery proceedings is another major factor.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of
increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.
Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a global and national economic recession
in 2020 and have been further impacted by the invasion of Ukraine and significant declines in labor force participation rates. The confluence of these disruptions has
resulted in the highest levels of inflation globally in 40 years and driven a significant policy response by central banks across the global economy. The U.S. Federal
Reserve has increased policy interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years and to levels high enough to slow economic activity. These actions and
impacts, including increased costs for goods and services and borrowing costs, have led to a significantly increased risk of recession. Additionally, inflation remains
elevated in part due to continued supply chain constraints and labor markets remaining tight. Electricity sales across all classes have recovered to pre-COVID-19
pandemic levels and

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
customer growth at both the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities has remained strong. However, weakening economic activity
increases the risk of slowing to declining energy sales. Additionally, the current economic environment has increased the uncertainty of future energy demand and
operating costs. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2022.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market
and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable
facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's
market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and
state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power
pool; and operational limitations. See "Income Tax Matters" herein for information regarding recent tax legislation expanding the availability of federal ITCs and PTCs.
Also see Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments
and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory
environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and
resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of
ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential across certain
parts of the U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on
Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing
services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical
events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and have resulted in higher natural gas prices.
Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher
volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas
producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and
maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy
sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and
labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the
pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under
requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi
Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are
likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies.
These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the
sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business
ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly
affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and
evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial
statements for additional information.
Environmental Matters
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water,
land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance
and GHG strategies to assess both current and

upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further
affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals,
including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and
replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or
financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or
changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas)
systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate
impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state
adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges,
and the ability to continue recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and/or
through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively.
Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern
Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2
and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty for some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental
laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance
for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use
concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water
withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of
siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA
provisions cannot be determined at this time.
Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect
results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future
environmental requirements, which may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.
Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or
updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital expenditures through 2027 based on the current environmental compliance strategy
for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows:

These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See "Global Climate Issues" herein for additional information. The
Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state
rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" herein and Note 6 to
the financial statements for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Air Quality
Since 1990, the Southern Company system reduced SO2 and NOx air emissions by 99% and 92%, respectively, through 2021. Since 2005, the Southern Company system
reduced mercury air emissions by 97% through 2021.
On March 11, 2022, the EPA released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan to require reductions in NOx emissions from sources in 26 states, including Alabama and
Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their interstate transport (good neighbor) obligations under the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
in downwind states. Georgia and North Carolina have approved interstate transport state implementation plans related to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to
this rule. The EPA is anticipated to issue a final rule by March 2023 with initial applicability for 2023. The ultimate impact of a final rule cannot be determined at this
time; however, it may result in increased compliance costs.
Water Quality
In 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash
transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration
Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program and provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will
permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, in October 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial
notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these subcategories.
Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to
cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO,
indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028.
The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition on September 30, 2022, Alabama
Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024 subject to certain operating conditions. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate
solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" and
"SEGCO," respectively, for additional information.
The remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling
approximately $1.4 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2022. The net book value
of $42 million for retired coal equipment at Plant Barry Unit 4 was reclassified to a regulatory asset at December 31, 2022. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama
Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs,
associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory
asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP
Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance" and " - Environmental Accounting Order" for additional
information.
Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on
53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of
December 31, 2028. Georgia Power also submitted a NOPP indicating plans to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2
(137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG
Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units.
The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.
The Georgia PSC approved the retirements of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (which occurred on August 31, 2022) and Plant Scherer Unit 3 in its 2022 IRP order, but
deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 to the 2025 IRP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule, referred to as
the ELG Supplemental Rule, is expected to be released by mid-2023. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance
strategies.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Coal Combustion Residuals
In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface
impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria
and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in
accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and
disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program, which has
broader applicability than the federal rule. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.
The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to
April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-
CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. Beginning on January 11, 2022, the EPA has
issued numerous Part A determinations that state its current positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements, such as criteria for groundwater corrective
action and CCR unit closure. The traditional electric operating companies are working with state regulatory agencies to determine whether the EPA's current positions
may impact closure and groundwater monitoring plans.
On April 8, 2022, the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group and a group of generating facility operators filed petitions for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit challenging whether the EPA's January 11, 2022 actions establish new legislative rules that should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking. A
decision by the court is expected in late 2023. The ultimate impacts of the EPA's current positions are subject to the outcome of the pending litigation and any potential
future rulemaking and cannot be determined at this time.
Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating
companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional
information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material.
Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued
recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating
companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements," Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power - Rate Plans" and "General Litigation Matters - Alabama Power," respectively, and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous
substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up
known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric
operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation
costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs
through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state
regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that
may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" for additional information.
Global Climate Issues
In 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which repealed and replaced the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and would have required
states to develop unit-specific CO2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme
Court issued an opinion limiting the EPA's authority
II-42

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act with a focus on whether such authority allows the EPA to regulate the electric industry in a manner as broad as the
CPP. The EPA has announced its intent to propose a new rule for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and to propose revised performance standards for new
fossil fuel-fired electric generating units pursuant to the Clean Air Act by April 2023. The ultimate impact of these actions cannot be determined at this time.
In February 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG
emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. In April
2021, President Biden announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The
target was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy;
however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in
2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 51% natural gas in 2022. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 6,700 MWs of coal-
fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,700 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, the Southern Company system's
capacity mix consists of over 11,500 MWs of renewable and storage facilities through ownership and long-term PPAs. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations
Water Quality" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has
replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3
million metric tons of CO2 equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.
The following table provides the Registrants' 2021 and preliminary 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:

(*) Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of
net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2022 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 46%
since 2007. GHG emissions increased in 2022 due to an increase in generation when compared to 2021 resulting from increased electricity sales, as discussed further
under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - "Southern Company - Electricity Business" herein. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG
emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar
requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating
fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors,
including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern
Company system management plans to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue
to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; implement initiatives
to reduce natural gas distribution operational emissions; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions,
including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to
support outcomes leading to a net zero future.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Regulatory Matters
See OVERVIEW - "Recent Developments" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial
condition.

Construction Programs
The Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The
Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission
and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest
construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power -
Nuclear Construction" for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for
information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.

Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas
distribution utilities to improve reliability, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment
and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas
Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.

See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their
construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.

Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements

General
Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities,
as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.

Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or
Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to
maintain a minimum coverage ratio.

Southern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2022, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,175
MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next eight years. Market demand is being driven by
load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.

Natural Gas
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a
unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern
Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that
Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources
not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.

As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern
Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not
meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of
Southern

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.
Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In
general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional information.
Solar and Wind
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity
charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for
the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of
energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally,
under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.
Income Tax Matters
Consolidated Income Taxes
The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax
Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes" herein and Note 10 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Tax Credits
Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with
existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.
Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) that are acquired or
constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on
Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion,
respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2026, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power
has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax
benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate
partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Income Taxes" and Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities - Tax Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax
Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.
Inflation Reduction Act
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and PTCs for clean energy projects, allows
PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the
transferability of the tax credits. The IRA extends and increases the tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and
nuclear projects. Additional ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy communities.
The IRA also enacted a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs and tax depreciation. The 15% corporate minimum tax
on book income can be reduced by energy tax credits.
For solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through
2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100%
PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects placed in service before 2022, the 2022 PTC rate is 2.6 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022, the 2022
PTC rate
II-45


---


# Page 92 of 330

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
is 2.75 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA
requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
Implementation of the IRA provisions is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS, and the ultimate impacts cannot be
determined at this time; however, the IRA is not expected to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial
condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined
at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not
anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may
affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the
application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants
(as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in
the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern
Company's Board of Directors.
Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state
regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas
distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and
the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking
process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This
treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains
or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their
financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the
traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROS,
and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they
would on a non-regulated company.
Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2022 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 88% for Southern
Company, 98% for Alabama Power, 97% for Georgia Power, 99% for Mississippi Power, and 88% for Southern Company Gas.
As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of
these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative,
judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the
applicable Registrants.

(Southern Company and Georgia Power)
In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM
report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost

Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred
through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid
pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be
presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that
any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee
Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence
proceeding on cost recovery will occur subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions
upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue
construction.
As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.6 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement
Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes construction contingency of $60 million and is based on projected in-
service dates at the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and
additional costs totaling $2.5 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and
necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report
and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for any subsequent construction and additional contingency costs
assigned to the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the
ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory
proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in 2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176
million ($131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax),
$264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth
quarter 2021, respectively; and $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax) in the second quarter
2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender
provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Joint Owner Contracts") or the
extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast
approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified
Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On September 29, 2022, Georgia
Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global
Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred
and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii)
Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further
adjustment for force majeure costs.
Georgia Power recorded additional pre-tax charges (credits) to income of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2021 and
approximately $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third
quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with
MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail
customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, regarding the cost-
sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments described in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Joint Owner
Contracts." Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with these provisions for OPC
and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast
through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees

<p>with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100% of their respective
remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to
Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service.</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available,
particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics.</p>
<p>The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further
equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing
activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes
of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases.</p>
<p>Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related reviews
and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4, may arise, which may result in additional license amendment requests or
require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs for Unit 4, are not resolved in
a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.</p>
<p>The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the
first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts described in Note 2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for
Georgia Power of up to $15 million per month for Unit 3 and $35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction,
support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts
related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek
recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and
such charges could be material.</p>
<p>Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant
management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on
results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.</p>
<p><b>Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)</b></p>
<p>The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require
significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to
implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate
reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.</p>
<p>Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under
a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each
subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is
jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax
credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation
allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations,
including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized. See Note 10 to the financial statements under
"Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities - Tax Credit Carryforwards" and " - Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information.</p>
<p>Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their
jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state
taxes considers apportionment factors and filing</p>

methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. Any apportionments and/or filing methodologies ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations
could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable
Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The
estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are
estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free
rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal
activities.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally
ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant
Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos
removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric
transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain
wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and
property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded
because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot
be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation
of the ARO.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future
cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating
companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional
information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information, including updates to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2022 by certain Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include
discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors.
Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return
on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized
over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the
assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs
and obligations.
Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit
plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and
other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the
weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The

discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations.
The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described in Note 11 to the financial
statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the
assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-
service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net
periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the
long-term rate of return on plan assets:

Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)

Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)

The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their
respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year and on an interim basis if
events and circumstances occur that indicate goodwill may be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a
component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic
characteristics.

As part of the goodwill impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform
the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost

factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying amount.
Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter 2022,
Southern Company recorded a $119 million impairment loss as a result of its annual goodwill impairment test for PowerSecure.
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly
impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of
the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making
certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants
consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants'
goodwill.
Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may
not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash
flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the
fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are
identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high
degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite
volatile in recent years. Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory
disallowances.
Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in
long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets.
For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of
losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, changes in tax legislation, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended
period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples
of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses
combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the
inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project.
As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and
because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these
estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million ($105 million after tax), respectively,
related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $131 million ($99 million after tax) related
to natural gas storage facilities. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded total pre-tax impairment charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity
method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged
Lease," respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments.
Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)
Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives,
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to
determine the appropriate transaction classification,
II-51


---


# Page 98 of 330

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below.
Lease Transactions
Southern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys
the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease,
Southern Power performs further analysis to determine whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales
contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract
and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service
is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in
the lease and are included in Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.
Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions
If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet
the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be
designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available
generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.
Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity
charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the
energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.
Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)
Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities
meet the definition of a business. Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are accounted for under the acquisition method, whereby the purchase price,
including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets,
primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each
asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to
assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred
construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by
Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.
Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)
Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are
evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.
If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are
consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power
reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as
ownership changes in membership interests.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of
cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance
sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The

HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to
the beginning of the period.
Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)
The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation,
and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these
contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable
and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of
such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting(ASU
2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR,
which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond
the original effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the
Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.
The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate
expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities
classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020
through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt and derivative arrangements that meet
the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to
LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that
will be in place at the transition date. No material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to
continue. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - "Overview" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under "Interest
Rate Derivatives" for additional information.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2022. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations,
including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include
distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build
new generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation fleet transition, to maintain existing
generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash
ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other
investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance.
Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing
natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See "Cash Requirements" herein for
additional information.
Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2022, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided $49 million in
operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2023 through 2025, projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed
operating cash flows for each of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas. Southern Company plans to finance future
cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and hybrid securities
in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions
from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage
seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as
their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to assess and mitigate risks associated with
the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all
of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with SOFR and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the
adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants expects the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact.
The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds
decreased in value at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2022 and no mandatory
contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2023. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" and "Pension
Plans," respectively, for additional information.
At the end of 2022, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $71.41 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book
value was $27.93 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 256%, compared to $68.58, $26.30, and 261%, respectively, at the end of 2021.

(b) Includes expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.2 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
(c) Excludes approximately $0.5 billion in 2023 and $0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2027 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to
market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.
These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any
future regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" herein for
additional information. At December 31, 2022, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the Registrants' construction programs.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate continued expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with
the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power
are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by
removal for others. These estimated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance
activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2027 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be
required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as
discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Environmental Matters - Environmental Laws and Regulations
- Coal Combustion Residuals" herein.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These
factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to
environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating
units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance
program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes;
abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market
opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information regarding Southern
Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.

The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years
began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact
construction expenditures.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "Construction Programs" herein for additional information.

**Other Significant Cash Requirements**

Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial
statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt
category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost
securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Fuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.  See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2022. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2022 that extend beyond 2027 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.

(*) Excludes capacity payments related to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments."

In connection with Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power, which are expected to be accounted for as leases, and are contingent upon approval by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated with the PPAs total $5 million in 2024, $68 million in 2025, $75 million in 2026, $76 million in 2027, and $670 million thereafter. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-term Service Agreements" for additional information. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures related to LTSAs are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from
operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power
plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein). Georgia Power intends to continue utilizing short-term floating rate bank loans and
commercial paper issuances to fund operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery.
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital
requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash
Requirements" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity
partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During
2022, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for existing tax equity partnerships totaling $51 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under
"General" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other
applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory
approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern
Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the
SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities
registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.
The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements"
for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled
with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.
The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and
for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric
operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate
commercial paper program.
Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately
without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas'
commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company
Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money
pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.5 billion. This restriction did not impact
Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its
currently anticipated cash obligations.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding
source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial
statements for additional information. Also see "Financing Activities" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022. The
following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants:

| At December 31, 2022 | Southern Company | Georgia Power | Mississippi Power | Southern Power | Southern Company Gas |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  | (in millions) |  |  |
| Current liabilities in excess of current assets | $ 5,308 | $ 3,179 | $ 50 | $ 263 | $ 532 |

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term
bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern
Company.
Bank Credit Arrangements
At December 31, 2022, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:

| At December 31, 2022 | Southern Company parent | Alabama Power | Georgia Power | Mississippi Power | Southern Power<sup>(a)</sup> | Southern Company Gas<sup>(b)</sup> | SEGCO | Southern Company |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  | (in millions) |  |  |  |
| Unused committed credit | $ 1,998 | $ 1,250 | $ 1,726 | $ 275 | $ 569 | $ 1,748 | $ 30 | $ 7,596 |

(a) At December 31, 2022, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $14 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not
parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b) Includes $798 million and $950 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration.
In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A
portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial
paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding
requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia
Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $288 million,
respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Bank
Credit Arrangements" for additional information.

*Short-term Borrowings*
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed
bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-
term bank term loans are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. Details of the Registrants' short-term borrowings were as follows:

Fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.
Southern Company
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $133 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increased natural gas
cost recovery at the natural gas distribution utilities, largely offset by decreased fuel cost recovery at the traditional electric operating companies.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction programs.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term debt, the issuance of common stock to settle the purchase
contracts entered into as part of the Equity Units (as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements under "Equity Units"), and an increase in short-term borrowings,
partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term and
short-term debt, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
Alabama Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $414 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased fuel cost recovery, the timing of customer
receivable collections, and fossil fuel stock purchases, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $211 million and $240 million,
respectively, related to the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 and, for 2022, $171 million related to the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. See Notes 2 and 15
to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to net long-term debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern
Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments and, in 2022, preferred stock redemptions.
Georgia Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $709 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased fuel cost recovery and the timing of customer
receivable collections, partially offset by lower income and property tax payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion,
respectively, related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for
additional information on construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

# COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to a net increase in short-term bank debt, capital contributions from Southern Company,
and net issuances of senior notes, partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to
capital contributions from Southern Company, borrowings from the FFB for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and net issuances and reofferings of other debt,
partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
## Mississippi Power
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $137 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the
timing of customer receivable collections.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern
Company and the issuance of revenue bonds. The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to the issuance of senior notes and capital
contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by debt redemptions, common stock dividend payments, and a decrease in commercial paper borrowings.
## Southern Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $136 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of federal ITCs, partially
offset by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher market prices of energy.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 was primarily related to ongoing construction activities. The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily
related to the acquisition of the Deuel Harvest wind facility and ongoing construction activities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for
additional information.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to the repayment of senior notes at maturity, common stock dividend payments, and net capital
distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern Company. The net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily
related to a return of capital to Southern Company and common stock dividend payments, partially offset by net capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and
net issuances of senior notes.
## Southern Company Gas
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $856 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increased natural gas cost recovery and the timing of
vendor payments, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to construction of transportation and distribution assets recovered through base rates and
infrastructure investment recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions. See Note 15 to the
financial statements for additional information.

related to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments
## Significant Balance Sheet Changes
### Southern Company
Significant balance sheet changes in 2022 for Southern Company included:
*   an increase of $3.5 billion in total property, plant, and equipment primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction programs, net of the reclassification of
    $0.6 billion to other regulatory assets and $0.4 billion to regulatory assets associated with AROs upon Georgia Power's retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2;
*   an increase of $2.7 billion in long-term debt (including securities due within one year) related to new issuances;
*   an increase of $2.5 billion in total common stockholders' equity primarily related to net income and the issuance of common stock to settle the purchase contracts

Credit Rating Risk
At December 31, 2022, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a
credit rating downgrade.
There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or
below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk
management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

(*) Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a
specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $106 million of cash collateral posted related to
PPA requirements at December 31, 2022.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either
Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter
of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at
which they do so.
Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), have agreements under which Mississippi Power provides retail service to the
Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The

agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i)
certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit
rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.
On February 22, 2022, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to BBB+ from A- with a stable outlook.
Also on February 22, 2022, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Southern Power, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO to negative from stable.
On December 15, 2022, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive.
Market Price Risk
The Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note
14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well as Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for
additional information.
Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that
sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel
prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs
implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices
for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's
facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties,
Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may
continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to
movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts
are priced at market.
Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and
weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures
contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively manages storage positions through a variety of
hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect
economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of
these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.
The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2022 for
the applicable Registrants:

short natural gas positions of 5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2022 and the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6
million mmBtu at December 31, 2021.

For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.08 per mmBtu above market prices at December 31,
2022 and was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of
the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are
recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the
financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern
Company Gas at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.
(c) Excludes cash collateral of $41 million as well as immaterial premium and associated intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives.

The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts, as applicable. The
Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties
who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note 14 to the financial statements.

Credit Risk
Southern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk.
Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.

Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of the 14 Marketers in Georgia. The
credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months.
Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain
credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2022, the four largest
Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 13% of Southern Company Gas' operating revenues and 15% of operating revenues for
Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.

Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the
security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit
support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company
Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas
believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta
Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek
repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those
customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based
on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also
assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available
credit reports, and audited financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also
have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters
or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note
2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately
88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 87% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2022, are
subject to rate regulation by their respective state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet the requirements under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its
financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to,
property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on
an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current
and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered
through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While
Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve:
(1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted
account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of
subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of
(1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to
customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these
judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment
to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
*   We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and
    equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the
    effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring
    and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
*   We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums,
    filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on
    precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's
    recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.

*   For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
*   We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.
*   We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

Disclosure of Uncertainties - Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction - Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements

*Critical Audit Matter Description*

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation; completion of documentation to support Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases.

The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $183 million in 2022.

In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction and testing; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.

*How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit*

Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the forecasted costs and the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule.

*   We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-
    owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges.
*   We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3
    and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of
    Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the construction schedule, and cost
    forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
*   We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3
    and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
*   We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any potential legal actions or issues arising
    from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
*   We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing and commercial
    operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all our procedures to evaluate whether there
    were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant
    Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
    including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alabama Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alabama Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Alabama Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Alabama Power's financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to Alabama Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAОВ.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Alabama Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Alabama Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note
2 (Regulatory Matters - Alabama Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Alabama Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate
regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other
regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues;
operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Alabama Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of
Alabama Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have
an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions'
regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Alabama Power expects to
recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not

approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those
investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted
account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs and the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing
the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of
incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's
accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of
accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
*   We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and
    equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the
    effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring
    and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
*   We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Alabama Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
    intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the
    Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory
    asset and liability balances for completeness.
*   For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Alabama Power and other interested parties that may impact Alabama Power's
    future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
*   We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included
    in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to
    assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.
*   We evaluated Alabama Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Georgia Power's financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to Georgia Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAОВ.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters
or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note
2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Georgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate
regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other
regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues;
operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of
Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have
an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions'
regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to
recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not

approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those
investments.

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted
account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of
subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of
(1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to
customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these
judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment
to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and
    equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the
    effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring
    and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
*   We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Georgia Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
    intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the
    Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory
    asset and liability balances for completeness.
*   For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Georgia Power and other interested parties that may impact Georgia Power's future
    rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
*   We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included
    in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to
    assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.
*   We evaluated Georgia Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

*Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction) to the
financial statements*

Critical Audit Matter Description

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to
multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service
Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its
ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous
uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing
and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on
potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production
levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into
testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities
installation; completion of documentation to support Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of remaining work package
closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include
management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-
up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves

further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are
based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further
schedule delays and/or cost increases.
The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia
Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability
of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future
regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $183 million in 2022.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the status of construction and testing;
(2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the
ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and
disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit
matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective
judgments.

*How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit*

Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in
the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:

*   We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the construction and ultimate cost
    recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the forecasted costs and
    the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule.
*   We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors), independent regulatory monitors, and co-
    owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and schedule challenges.
*   We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3
    and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of
    Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the construction schedule, and cost
    forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
*   We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3
    and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
*   We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any potential legal actions or issues arising
    from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
*   We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing and commercial
    operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all our procedures to evaluate whether there
    were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant
    Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
    including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Mississippi Power's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note
2 (Regulatory Matters - Mississippi Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Mississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America to utilize specialized rules to account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of
rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other
regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets - asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and
over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of
Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can
have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions'
regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi Power expects to
recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions

will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on
those investments.

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted
account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of
subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of
(1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's
accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of
accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
*   We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Mississippi Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
    intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the
    Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory
    asset and liability balances for completeness.
*   For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Mississippi Power and other interested parties that may impact Mississippi Power's
    future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
*   We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included
    in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
*   We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to
    assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.
*   We evaluated Mississippi Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and subsidiary companies (Southern Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Power's financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to Southern Power in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAОВ.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Southern Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income/Loss Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Power has entered into a number of tax equity partnership arrangements, wherein they agree to sell 100% of a class of membership interests (e.g. Class A) in an
entity to a noncontrolling investor in exchange for cash contributions, while retaining control of the entity through a separate class of membership interests (e.g. Class B).
The agreements for these partnerships give different rights and priorities to their owners in terms of cash distributions, tax attribute allocations, and partnership income or
loss allocations. These provisions make the conventional equity method of accounting where an investor applies its "percentage ownership interest" to the investee's net
income under generally accepted accounting principles to determine the investor's share of earnings or losses difficult to apply. Therefore, Southern Power uses the
Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) accounting method to account for these partnership arrangements. The HLBV accounting method calculates each
partner's share of income or loss based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim at the end of the reporting period compared to the beginning of the
reporting period. The application of the HLBV accounting method by Southern Power required significant consideration of the allocations between Southern Power and
the noncontrolling investors over the life of the agreement and the liquidation provisions of the agreement to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss
between the parties.

---|---
The determination of the appropriate amount of allocated partnership income or loss to noncontrolling interests using the HLBV accounting method required increased
audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge, including evaluation of the terms of the agreement and consideration of the appropriateness of the HLBV model based
on the provisions of the agreement.

*How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit*
Our audit procedures included the following, among others:
*   For agreements that result in potentially material allocations of partnership income or loss, we read the agreements to understand the liquidation provisions and the
    provisions governing the allocation of benefits.
*   We evaluated the HLBV models utilized by management to determine whether the models accurately reflect the allocation of income or loss and tax attributes in
    accordance with the liquidation provisions and allocation terms defined in the agreements, as well as whether the inputs in the models are accurate and complete.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern Company Gas) (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Southern Company Gas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment which is accounted for by the use of the
equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company Gas include its equity investment in SNG of $1,243 million and
$1,129 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of $146 million, $127 million,
and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports (which express
unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to SNG's significant transactions with related parties)
have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Company Gas'
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note
2 (Regulatory Matters - Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88% of Southern Company Gas'
consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable
state regulatory agencies (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of regulation. Accounting for

the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.

The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:

* We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
* We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
* For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
* We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
* We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.
* We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the

December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on

## Postretirement Benefit Obligation
At December 31, 2022, the Company's postretirement benefit obligation was $14 million and the Company's plan assets were $59 million, resulting in a net asset position
of $45 million. As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the postretirement benefit obligation is primarily based on actuarial calculations, which
include various significant assumptions.

We identified the Company's estimate of the postretirement benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Auditing the postretirement benefit obligation required complex
auditor judgment due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation, which include the discount rate and the expected return on plan
assets. These assumptions had a significant effect on the postretirement benefit obligation calculation.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
*   Comparing the actuarial assumptions used by management with historical trends and evaluating the change in the postretirement benefit obligation from prior
    year due to changes in assumptions.
*   Evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments.
*   Evaluating the expected return on plan assets by assessing whether management's assumptions were consistent with a range of returns for a portfolio of
    comparative investments that was determined based on publicly available information.

### Emphasis of Matter - Significant Transactions with Related Parties
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant transactions with related parties.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General
Southern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc,
Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires,
owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company
Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga
Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services.
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary
companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company
subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and
Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by
Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility
customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
The Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity
investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-
sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the
noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based
on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See "Variable Interest Entities"
herein and Note 7 for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by
the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other
applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with
GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior
years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the
Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU
2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR,
which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond
the original effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the
Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.
The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate
expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities
classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt and derivative
arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to
LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that
will be in place at the transition date. No material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to
continue. See Note 14 under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for additional information.
Affiliate Transactions
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which certain of the following services are
rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general executive and advisory, general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal,
tax, information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications,
cellular tower space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern Company power pool transactions. These costs
are primarily included in other operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment. Costs for these services from SCS in 2022, 2021,
and 2020 were as follows:

Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have agreements with Southern Nuclear under which Southern Nuclear renders the following nuclear-related services at cost:
general executive and advisory services; general operations, management, and technical services; administrative services including procurement, accounting, employee
relations, systems, and procedures services; strategic planning and budgeting services; other services with respect to business and operations; and, for Georgia Power,
construction management. These costs are primarily included in other operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment. Costs for
these services in 2022, 2021, and 2020 amounted to $267 million, $258 million, and $262 million, respectively, for Alabama Power and $895 million, $906 million, and
$883 million, respectively, for Georgia Power. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information regarding Southern Nuclear's
construction management of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Georgia Power.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS and Southern Nuclear prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, were approved by
the SEC. Subsequently, additional cost allocation methodologies have been reported to the FERC and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits
services to be rendered at cost by system service companies.
Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's power purchases from affiliates through the Southern Company power pool are included in purchased power, affiliates on their
respective statements of income. Mississippi Power's and Southern Power's power purchases from affiliates through the Southern Company power pool are included in
purchased power on their respective statements of income and were as follows:

SCS, as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, has agreements with certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas to purchase
natural gas. Natural gas purchases made under these agreements were immaterial for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power for all periods presented
and immaterial, $18 million, and $26 million for Southern Power in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Alabama Power and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Greene County. The companies have an agreement under which Alabama Power operates Plant Greene County
and Mississippi Power reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which totaled $6 million, $10 million,
and $9 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information.

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each have agreements with PowerSecure for equipment purchases and/or services related to utility infrastructure
construction, distributed energy, and energy efficiency projects. Costs under these agreements were immaterial for all periods presented.

In 2022, Southern Company Gas entered into a $70 million contract with the U.S. General Services Administration to increase energy efficiency at certain federal
buildings across Georgia, with completion expected to occur in 2024. Southern Company Gas engaged PowerSecure to provide the majority of the construction services
under the contract. During 2022, Southern Company Gas paid $10 million to PowerSecure related to this agreement.

See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for information regarding Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's equity method investment in SEGCO and related affiliate purchased power
costs, as well as Alabama Power's gas pipeline ownership agreement with SEGCO.

Southern Power has several agreements with SCS for transmission services, which are billed to Southern Power based on the Southern Company Open Access
Transmission Tariff as filed with the FERC. Transmission services purchased by Southern Power from SCS totaled $39 million, $28 million, and $15 million for 2022,
2021, and 2020, respectively, and were charged to other operations and maintenance expenses in Southern Power's consolidated statements of income.

The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either
directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 14 under
"Contingent Features" for additional information. Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above
transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See "Revenues - Southern Power" herein
for additional information.

The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and receive such services from other Southern
Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and
Southern Company Gas neither provided nor received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
liabilities represent costs recovered that are expected to be incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be
credited to customers through the ratemaking process.

In the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer subject to applicable accounting rules
for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the

II-124

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including
details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.
Revenues
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance, including revenue from contracts with
customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting. See Notes 4, 9, and 14 for additional information.
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The majority of the revenues of the traditional electric operating companies are generated from contracts with retail electric customers. These revenues, generated from
the integrated service to deliver electricity when and if called upon by the customer, are recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, at a tariff rate,
and as electricity is delivered to the customer during the month. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Retail rates may
include provisions to adjust revenues for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are
adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the
balance sheets and are recovered from or returned to customers, respectively, through adjustments to the billing factors. See Note 2 for additional information regarding
regulatory matters of the traditional electric operating companies.
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms. Energy and other revenues are generally recognized as services are
provided. The contracts for capacity and energy in a wholesale PPA have multiple performance obligations where the contract's total transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation based on the standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific
goods or services transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, the traditional electric operating companies recognize revenue as the performance obligations
are satisfied over time as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is available to the customer.
For both retail and wholesale revenues, the traditional electric operating companies have elected to recognize revenue for their sales of electricity and capacity using the
invoice practical expedient as they generally have a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance
completed to date and that may be invoiced. Payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of the Registrants'
performance obligation.
Southern Power
Southern Power sells capacity and energy at rates specified under contractual terms in long-term PPAs. These PPAs are accounted for as leases, non-derivatives, or
normal sale derivatives. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Energy
revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as sales-type leases are recognized by accounting for interest
income on the net investment in the lease.
Southern Power's non-lease contracts commonly include capacity and energy which are considered separate performance obligations. In these contracts, the total
transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price
charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Power recognizes revenue as the performance
obligations are satisfied over time, as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is made available to the customer.
Southern Power generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date and
may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. Payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month
following satisfaction of Southern Power's performance obligation.
When multiple contracts exist with the same counterparty, the revenues from each contract are accounted for as separate arrangements.
Southern Power may also enter into contracts to sell short-term capacity in the wholesale electricity markets. These sales are generally classified as mark-to-market
derivatives and net unrealized gains and losses on such contracts are recorded in wholesale revenues. See Note 14 and "Financial Instruments" herein for additional
information.

Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas records revenues when goods or services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates approved by the state regulatory agencies
of the natural gas distribution utilities. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated natural gas market whereby Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas
to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. As required by the Georgia PSC, Atlanta Gas Light bills Marketers in equal monthly installments
for each residential, commercial, and industrial end-use customer's distribution costs as well as for capacity costs utilizing a seasonal rate design for the calculation of
each residential end-use customer's annual straight-fixed-variable charge, which reflects the historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class.
The majority of the revenues of Southern Company Gas are generated from contracts with natural gas distribution customers. Revenues from this integrated service to
deliver gas when and if called upon by the customer are recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time and are recognized at a tariff rate as gas is
delivered to the customer during the month.
The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred with the performance obligations.
Generally, Southern Company Gas recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time as natural gas is delivered to the customer. The performance
obligations related to wholesale gas services are satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at a point in time when natural gas is delivered to the customer.
Southern Company Gas has elected to recognize revenue for sales of gas using the invoice practical expedient as it generally has a right to consideration in an amount
that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date and that may be invoiced. Payment for goods and services rendered is
typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Company Gas' performance obligation.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities have rate structures that include volumetric rate designs that allow the opportunity to
recover certain costs based on gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to
customers. Revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, unbilled
revenues are recognized for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting period. For other commercial
and industrial customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries through the end of the period.
The tariffs for the natural gas distribution utilities include provisions which allow for the recognition of certain revenues prior to the time such revenues are billed to
customers. These provisions are referred to as alternative revenue programs and provide for the recognition of certain revenues prior to billing, as long as the amounts
recognized will be collected from customers within 24 months of recognition. Revenue related to alternative revenue programs was $(6) million, $11 million, and $3
million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These programs are as follows:
*   Weather normalization adjustments - reduce customer bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increase customer bills when weather is warmer
    than normal and are included in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas;
*   Revenue normalization mechanisms - mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage and are contained in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas
    and Nicor Gas; and
*   Revenue true-up adjustment- included within the provisions of the GRAM program in which Atlanta Gas Light participates as a short-term alternative to formal
    rate case filings, the revenue true-up feature provides for a positive (or negative) adjustment to record revenue in the amount of any variance to budgeted
    revenues, which are submitted and approved annually as a requirement of GRAM. Such adjustments are reflected in customer billings in a subsequent program
    year.

Wholesale Gas Services
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas netted revenues from energy and risk management activities with the associated costs. Profits from
sales between segments were eliminated and recognized as goods or services sold to end-use customers. Southern Company Gas recorded wholesale gas services'
transactions that qualified as derivatives at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or
losses. Gains and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes were presented on a net basis in revenue. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information on the sale of Sequent.

Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues from natural gas sales and transportation services in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers
and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Southern Company Gas also
recognizes unbilled revenues for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period.
For other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the period.
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues on 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or cumulative billed amounts.
Concentration of Revenue
Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power (with the exception of its full requirements cost-based MRA electric tariffs described below),
Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas each have a diversified base of customers and no single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of each company's
revenues.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under
requirements cost-based MRA electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of
Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one
customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes fuel transportation costs
and the cost of purchased emissions allowances as they are used. For Alabama Power and Georgia Power, fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of
nuclear fuel. For the traditional electric operating companies, fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel-hedging programs as approved by their respective state
PSCs.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, Southern Company Gas charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using
natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed
through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Southern Company Gas defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the
amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period such that no operating income is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed
or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred and accrued natural gas costs are included in the balance sheets as regulatory
assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services' customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Within cost of natural gas, Southern Company Gas
also includes costs of lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain
derivatives.
Income Taxes
The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies are amortized over the average life of the related
property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas
distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset.
Under current tax law, certain projects at Southern Power related to the construction of renewable facilities are eligible for federal ITCs. Southern Power estimates
eligible costs which, as they relate to acquisitions, may not be finalized until the allocation of the purchase price to assets has been finalized. Southern Power applies the
deferred method to ITCs, whereby the ITCs are recorded as a deferred credit and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. Furthermore, the
tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis
difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. State ITCs are recognized as an income tax benefit in the
period in which the credits are generated. In addition, certain projects are eligible for federal and state PTCs, which are recognized as an income tax benefit based on
KWH production.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Federal ITCs and PTCs, as well as state ITCs and other state tax credits available to reduce income taxes payable, were not fully utilized in 2022 and will be carried
forward and utilized in future years. In addition, Southern Company is expected to have various state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for certain of its
subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power and Southern Power, which would result in income tax benefits in the future, if utilized. See Note 10 under "Current and
Deferred Income Taxes - Tax Credit Carryforwards" and "- Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information.
The Registrants recognize tax positions that are "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 10 under
"Unrecognized Tax Benefits" for additional information.
Other Taxes
Taxes imposed on and collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies are presented net on the Registrants' statements of income and are excluded from the
transaction price in determining the revenue related to contracts with a customer.
Southern Company Gas is taxed on its gas revenues by various governmental authorities, but is allowed to recover these taxes from its customers. Revenue taxes
imposed on the natural gas distribution utilities are recorded at the amount charged to customers, which may include a small administrative fee, as operating revenues,
and the related taxes imposed on Southern Company Gas are recorded as operating expenses on the statements of income. Revenue taxes included in operating expenses
were $158 million, $119 million, and $104 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities record AFUDC, which represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds
that are necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently, AFUDC increases the revenue requirement and is recovered
over the service life of the asset through a higher rate base and higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not taxable.
Interest related to financing the construction of new facilities at Southern Power and new facilities not included in the traditional electric operating companies' and
Southern Company Gas' regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest capitalization requirements.
Total AFUDC and interest capitalized for the Registrants in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction
price that is less than the asset group's carrying amount, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying
amount of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by
estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying amount is
compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value
is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged Lease," respectively, and
Note 15 under "Southern Company" and "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities
Southern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective PPA. Southern Company Gas'
goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's
goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure.
For its 2022 and 2020 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas management performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than
not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative assessment was required. For its 2021
annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas management performed the quantitative assessment and confirmed that the fair values of all of its reporting units with
goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts.
For its 2021 and 2020 annual impairment tests, PowerSecure management performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of PowerSecure
exceeding its carrying amount. For its 2022 annual impairment test, PowerSecure management performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of
PowerSecure being lower than its carrying amount. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from
declining macroeconomic conditions, reducing sales growth and estimated cash flows. As a result, a goodwill impairment of $119 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter 2022. The worldwide disruptions in supply chain, reduced labor availability and productivity, and reduced economic activity in the United States have had a
variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including PowerSecure. If these factors continue to negatively affect the operating results of
PowerSecure, all or a portion of its remaining goodwill of $144 million may become impaired.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, goodwill was as follows:

Acquisition Accounting
At the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. Acquisitions that meet the definition of a
business are accounted for under the acquisition method, and operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring entity's financial statements. The
purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any
intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is
allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage independent valuation experts to
assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred
construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for
potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
Historically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is placed in service. For contingent
consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair
value information.
Development Costs
For Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its economics and operational feasibility,
as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable. Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the
balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and
included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of completion, any of Southern
Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income.
Long-Term Service Agreements
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating
facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs also obligate the
counterparties to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.
Payments made under the LTSAs for the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned capital maintenance are recorded in the statements of cash flows as
investing activities. Receipts of major parts into materials and supplies inventory prior to planned inspections are treated as noncash transactions in the statements of cash
flows. Any payments made prior to the work being performed are recorded as prepayments in other current assets and noncurrent assets on the balance sheets. At the
time work is performed, an appropriate amount is accrued for future payments or transferred from the prepayment and recorded as property, plant, and equipment or
expensed.
Transmission Receivables/Prepayments
As a result of Southern Power's acquisition and construction of generating facilities, Southern Power has transmission receivables and/or prepayments representing the
portion of interconnection network and transmission upgrades that will be reimbursed to Southern Power. Upon completion of the related project, transmission costs are
generally reimbursed by the interconnection provider within a five-year period and the receivable/prepayments are reduced as payments or services are received.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities
of 90 days or less.

Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves

Each traditional electric operating company maintains a reserve to cover or is allowed to defer and recover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution lines and, for Mississippi Power, the cost of uninsured damages to its generation facilities and other property. Alabama Power also has authority from the
Alabama PSC to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. Alabama Power recorded additional accruals of $65 million and $100 million in 2021 and
2020, respectively, which are included in the table below. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders, the traditional electric operating companies accrued the
following amounts related to storm damage recovery in 2022, 2021, and 2020:

Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials.
Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas inventory, liquefied natural gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies.
Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.
Materials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when
installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.
Fuel Inventory
Fuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and emissions allowances. Fuel inventory
for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil, natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when
purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost, as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric
operating companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.
Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment,
Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline
storage services that it has under contract, along with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets
and related natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.
Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year end are charged to cost
of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO
cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism
adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net
income. At December 31, 2022, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $170 million. Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2022, the estimated
replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2022 was $613 million.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and all other segments record inventory at LOCOM, with cost determined on a WACOG basis. For these segments,
Southern Company Gas evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventories against market prices to determine whether any declines in market prices below
the WACOG are other than temporary. For any declines considered to be other than temporary, Southern Company Gas records LOCOM adjustments to cost of natural
gas to reduce the value of its natural gas inventories to market value. LOCOM adjustments were immaterial for all periods presented.
Provision for Uncollectible Accounts
The customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the majority of receivables, a provision for
uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection experience and other factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific
customer's inability to pay, a provision for uncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If
circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could affect this estimate include, but are not
limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions. Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For
all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.
Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to)
customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the
respective year.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist ofl 4 Marketers in Georgia
(including SouthStar). The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in
the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible

for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service,
billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two
times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.
Financial Instruments
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of
certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to
limit exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, weather, interest rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheets (included in "Other" or shown separately as "Risk Management Activities") and are measured at fair value. See Note 13 for additional
information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that
meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the "normal" scope exception, and are accounted for
under the accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating
companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities,
respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item.
See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.
The Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under netting arrangements. The
Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2022.
The Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants have established risk
management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating
Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the
intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.
Southern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX
futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues
that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are
carried at fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for
accounting purposes.
The purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, rather than on the fair value
basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred
for the contracted storage and transportation capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are
recognized on the statements of income in the period they are incurred. This difference in accounting methods can result in volatility in reported earnings, even though
the economic margin is substantially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.
Comprehensive Income
The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic
events of the period other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income attributable to the Registrant, changes in the fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts included in net income. Comprehensive income also consists of certain changes in pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.

Variable Interest Entities

The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 7 for additional information regarding VIEs.

## Alabama Power
Alabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power
currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues
accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power.
## Certificates of Convenience and Necessity
In 2020, the Alabama PSC issued its order regarding Alabama Power's 2019 petition for a CCN, which authorized Alabama Power to (i) construct an approximately720-
MW combined cycle facility at Alabama Power's Plant Barry (Plant Barry Unit 8) that is expected to be placed in service in November 2023, (ii) complete the acquisition
of the Central Alabama Generating Station, which occurred in August 2020, (iii) purchase approximately 240 MWs of combined cycle generation under a long-term
PPA, which began in September 2020, and (iv) pursue up to approximately 200 MWs of cost-effective demand-side management and distributed energy resource
programs. Alabama Power's petition for a CCN was predicated on the results of Alabama Power's 2019 IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an
approximately 2,400-MW resource need for Alabama Power, driven by the need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 under "Alabama Power" for
additional information on the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station.
The Alabama PSC authorized the recovery of actual costs for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 up to5% above the estimated in-service cost of $652 million. In so
doing, it recognized the potential for developments that could cause the project costs to exceed the capped amount, in which case Alabama Power would provide
documentation to the Alabama PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of the additional costs. At December 31, 2022, project expenditures associated with Plant
Barry Unit 8 totaled approximately $518 million, of which $513 million and $5 million was included in CWIP and property, plant, and equipment in service,
respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. The recovery of costs associated with laws, regulations,
and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-
related costs associated with the PPAs through its Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any
remaining costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 are expected to be recovered through Rate RSE.
Through May 2023, Alabama Power expects to recover substantially all costs associated with the Central Alabama Generating Station through Rate RSE, offset by
revenues from a previous power sales agreement. Beginning in July 2022, fuel costs associated with Central Alabama Generating Station are being recovered through
Rate ECR.
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station, a743-MW winter peak,
simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama. The acquisition was approved by the FERC on March 25, 2022. The transaction
closed on September 30, 2022 and, on October 3, 2022, Alabama Power filed Rate CNP New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover the related costs, as described
further under "Rate CNP New Plant" herein. Alabama Power is recovering the remaining costs associated with the Calhoun Generating Station through its existing rate
structure, primarily Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.
## Renewable Generation Certificate
Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by September 16, 2027 and to market the related energy
and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Through December 31, 2022, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 330
MWs.
## Rate RSE
The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER)
compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for
any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range,
there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has
an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.
Alabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure.
Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power's equity ratio was
approximately 52.2% and 51.6%, respectively.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Generally, during a year without a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the
amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all
amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. During a year with a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds6.15%, customers
receive 50% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.90% and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of6.90%. Alabama Power's ability to retain a portion of the revenue
that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range positions Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality, without
increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. There is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range.
Retail rates under Rate RSE did not change for 2020 or 2022 and increased by 4.09%, or approximately $228 million annually, effective with the billing month of
January 2021.
At December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Alabama Power's WCER exceeded6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $50 million,
$181 million, and $62 million, respectively, for Rate RSE refunds. The 2020 refund was issued to customers through bill credits in April 2021. In accordance with an
Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power applied $126 million of the 2021 refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the
remaining $55 million was refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022. See "Rate ECR" herein for additional information. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama
PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023.
On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2023. Projected earnings
were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2023.
Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated
deferred income taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately $318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the rate increase
discussed under "Rate CNP Depreciation" herein. The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at
a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Rate CNP New Plant
Rate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated generating facilities placed into retail
service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period January 2020 through October 2022. On October 3, 2022, Alabama Power filed Rate CNP
New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover costs related to the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The filing reflected an increase in annual revenues of
$34 million, or 0.6%, effective with November 2022 billings. See "Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information.
Rate CNP PPA
Rate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. Revenues for Rate CNP PPA, as recorded on the financial
statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no
significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during
the period 2020 through 2022 and no adjustment is expected for 2023. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of $120
million, of which $18 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $102 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At
December 31, 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of $84 million included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.
Rate CNP Compliance
Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry
involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP
Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama
PSC by December 1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation,
and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's
revenues or

net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no
effect on net income.
In November 2020, November 2021, and December 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with governmental mandates for
the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. Both the 2020 and 2021 filings reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of
approximately $59 million. In December 2020 and 2021, the Alabama PSC issued consent orders that Alabama Power leave the 2020 Rate CNP Compliance factors in
effect for 2021 and 2022, respectively, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered, and any remaining
under recovery reflected in the 2022 filing. The 2022 filing reflected a $255 million, or 3.7%, annual increase effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to
updated depreciation rates.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $47 million and $16 million, respectively, included in other
regulatory assets, current and other regulatory assets, deferred, respectively, on the balance sheet.
Rate CNP Depreciation
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to
certain depreciation rates, excluding any depreciation recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, or costs associated with the capitalization of asset
retirement costs. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. See
"Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order" herein for information related to 2023 customer bill credits approved by the Alabama PSC.
Rate ECR
Rate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues
recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or
liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing
rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but will impact the related operating
cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.
In 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94 million in accordance with an Alabama PSC order and returned that amount to customers in the
form of bill credits.
Also in 2020, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from2.160 cents per KWH to 1.960 cents per KWH, equal to 1.84%, or approximately $103 million
annually, that became effective with January 2021 billings and remained in effect through July 2022 billings.
The Alabama PSC approved adjustments to Rate ECR from1.960 cents per KWH to 2.557 cents per KWH, or approximately $310 million annually, effective with
August 2022 billings and from 2.557 cents per KWH to 3.510 cents per KWH, or approximately $500 million annually, effective with December 2022 billings. The rate
will adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in January 2025 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.
In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power applied $26 million of its 2021 Rate RSE refund to reduce the Rate ECR under
recovered balance. See "Rate RSE" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled $622 million, of which
$102 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $520 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021,
Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled $126 million and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. These classifications are based
on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a
significant impact on the timing of any recovery or return of fuel costs.
Software Accounting Order
The Alabama PSC authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The
regulatory asset is amortized ratably over the life of the related software. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the regulatory asset balance totaled $46 million and
$35 million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.

Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information. In
September 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP with no deficiencies identified.
Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 in December 2025 and
2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life. The Plant Greene County unit retirements identified by Mississippi Power require the completion of
transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of the transmission and
system reliability improvements. Currently, Alabama Power plans to retire Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 at the dates indicated. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Rate NDR
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms
to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component
is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a
reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches $75 million.
The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future
reserve deficits over a 48-month period (24-month period prior to modifications approved by the Alabama PSC on July 12, 2022). The Alabama PSC order gives
Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. The maximum total Rate NDR
charge was limited to $10.00 per month per non-residential customer account and $5.00 per month per residential customer account through July 12, 2022.
Subsequently, modifications approved by the Alabama PSC replaced the maximum total Rate NDR charge with a maximum charge to recover a deficit of $5 per month
per non-residential customer account and $2.50 per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC,
to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant, which can be used to offset storm charges. Alabama Power made additional accruals of $65 million and
$100 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Alabama Power collected approximately $14 million, $6 million, and $5 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, under Rate NDR. Beginning with August 2022
billings, the reserve establishment charge was suspended and the reserve maintenance charge was activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding $75 million.
Alabama Power expects to collect approximately $12 million annually under Rate NDR unless the NDR balance falls below $50 million. At December 31, 2022 and
2021, the NDR balance was $97 million and $103 million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheets.
As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result,
the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows.
Reliability Reserve Accounting Order
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the
previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance
exceeds $35 million. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued $166 million to the reserve, which is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the
balance sheet.
Environmental Accounting Order
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered
investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements
caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision
regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance.
With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to certain
operating conditions. In September 2022, Alabama Power reclassified approximately $600 million for Plant Barry Unit 5 from plant in service, net of depreciation to
other utility plant, net and will continue to

depreciate the asset according to the original depreciation rates. At retirement, Alabama Power will reclassify the remaining net investment costs of the unit to a
regulatory asset to be recovered over the unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision to retire, through Rate CNP Compliance. See "Certificates of
Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information.
On December 5, 2022, in conjunction with Alabama Power's compliance plan for the EPA's final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule, Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased
using coal and began operating solely on natural gas. As a result, approximately $42 million of plant in service, net of depreciation was reclassified to a regulatory asset to
be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance through 2034, the unit's remaining useful life.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power
recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, the ECCR tariff, and Municipal Franchise
Fee (MFF) tariffs. These tariffs were set under the 2019 ARP for the years 2020 through 2022 and under the 2022 ARP for the years 2023 through 2025 as described
herein. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected
through a fuel cost recovery tariff, both under separate regulatory proceedings.
See "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding" herein for information regarding the approved recovery through retail base rates of certain costs
related to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Common Facilities) that will become effective the month after Unit
3 is placed in service. As costs are included in retail base rates, the related financing costs will no longer be recovered through the NCCR tariff. See "Nuclear
Construction" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Rate Plans
2022 ARP
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on January 1, 2023 and will increase rates
annually for 2024 and 2025 as detailed below, with the incremental revenue requirements related to DSM tariffs and CCR AROs subject to updates through annual
compliance filings to be made at least 90 days prior to the effective date. Georgia Power will recover estimated adjustments through its existing tariffs as follows:

In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of estimated CCR ARO compliance costs for 2023, 2024, and 2025 overfour-year
periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditures, resulting in an
estimated $20 million reduction in the related amortization expense for 2023. The estimated compliance costs expected to be incurred in 2023, 2024, and 2025 are
$320 million, $410 million, and $510 million, respectively. The CCR ARO costs are expected to be revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through future
annual compliance filings. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Further, under the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50% and its equity ratio is set at56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of
9.50% to 11.90%. Any retail earnings above 11.90% will be shared, with 40% being applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the
remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term
of the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it may petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the
Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule on Georgia Power's
request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2026 or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting
implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case.

In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of the estimated under recovered balance of CCR ARO compliance costs. Under the 2019
ARP, the under recovered balance at December 31, 2019 and compliance costs for 2020 were recovered over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Recovery
of estimated compliance costs for 2021 and 2022 are being recovered over four-year periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, as authorized under the 2019
ARP and modified under the 2022 ARP, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The CCR ARO costs recovered
through the ECCR tariff are revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through annual compliance filings, which resulted in an approximate $90 million
decrease and $10 million increase effective January 1, 2021 and 2022, respectively, in the related cost recovery. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional
information.
Georgia Power's retail ROE under the 2019 ARP was set at 10.50% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of 9.50% to 12.00%. Any retail earnings
above 12.00% were shared, with 40% applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. In
2020, Georgia Power's retail ROE was within the allowed retail ROE range. In 2021, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced
regulatory assets by approximately $5 million and accrued approximately $5 million which was refunded to customers in 2022. In 2022, Georgia Power's retail ROE
exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by approximately $119 million and accrued approximately $119 million, which is expected to be
refunded to customers through bill credits later in the first quarter 2023, prior to review and approval by the Georgia PSC, in accordance with the 2022 ARP.
Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding
In accordance with a Georgia PSC order approved in November 2021, Georgia Power will include in rate base an allocation of $.1 billion to Unit 3 and Common
Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and will recover the related depreciation expense through
retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. Financing costs on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction
costs will continue to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power will defer as a regulatory asset the remaining depreciation expense
(approximately $40 million annually) until Unit 4 costs are placed in retail base rates. In addition, the stipulated agreement clarified that following the prudency review,
the remaining amount to be placed in retail base rates will be net of the proceeds from the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and will not be used to offset imprudent
costs, if any.
The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately $302 million also includes recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and
the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is
placed in service. As approved by the Georgia PSC, the increase in annual retail base rates will be adjusted based on the actual in-service date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3.
See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Integrated Resource Plans
In 2021, as authorized in its 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested and received certification from the Georgia PSC for970 MWs of utility-scale PPAs for solar generation
resources. In response to supply chain challenges in the solar industry, the Georgia PSC approved a request by Georgia Power to extend the required commercial
operation dates for the PPAs from 2023 to 2024.

On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the
Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the 2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following:
*   Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), which occurred on August 31, 2022, and reclassification
    to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values and any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventories upon retirement. The regulatory
    asset accounts for the remaining net book values of the units ($292 million and $270 million for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively, at December 31, 2022) were
    amortized at a rate equal to the unit depreciation rates authorized in the 2019 ARP through December 31, 2022. Under the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC
    approved recovery of the remaining regulatory asset balances for the net book values of the units through 2030 and deferred a decision on the timing of recovery
    of the regulatory asset account for the unusable materials and supplies inventories ($13 million at December 31, 2022) to a future base rate case.
*   Decertification and retirement of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) by December 31, 2028 and reclassification to regulatory asset
    accounts of the remaining net book value (approximately $601 million at December 31, 2022). Under the 2022 ARP, $43 million annually of the related
    depreciation is being deferred to a regulatory asset, which will be amortized over six years beginning in 2029. Any remaining unusable materials and supplies
    inventory will be reclassified to regulatory asset accounts upon retirement, with the timing of recovery to be determined in a future base rate case.
*   Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028. See Note 7
    under "SEGCO" for additional information.
*   Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its ash ponds and landfills. Recovery of the
    related costs incurred beyond 2025 is expected to be determined in future base rate cases. The Georgia PSC's approval of the 2022 IRP included a change in the
    method of closure for one ash pond. See "Rate Plans" herein and Note 6 for additional information.
*   Installation of environmental controls at Plants Bowen and Scherer for compliance with rules related to effluent limitations guidelines.
*   Initiation of a license renewal application with the NRC for Plant Hatch.
*   Investments related to the continued hydro operations of Plants Sinclair and Burton.
*   Provisional authorization for development of a 265-MW battery energy storage facility with expected commercial operation in 2026.
*   Issuance of requests for proposals (RFP) for 2,300 MWs of renewable resources, an additional 500 MWs of energy storage, and up to 140 MWs of biomass
    generation.
*   Related transmission projects necessary to support the generation facilities plan.
*   Certification of six PPAs (including five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power that are subject to approval by the FERC) with capacities ofl,567 MWs beginning
    in 2024, 380 MWs beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028, procured through RFPs authorized in the 2019 IRP. See Note 9 for additional
    information.

The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to the 2025 IRP. Under the 2022 ARP,
$40 million annually of the related depreciation is being deferred to a regulatory asset, which will be amortized overfour years beginning in 2031. The Georgia PSC
rejected Georgia Power's request to certify approximately 88 MWs of wholesale capacity to be placed in retail rate base between January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025.
Georgia Power may offer such capacity in the wholesale market or to the retail jurisdiction in a future regulatory proceeding.
On August 26, 2022, Restore Chattooga Gorge Coalition (RCG) filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against Georgia Power and the Georgia
PSC. The petition challenges Georgia Power's plan to expend $115 million to modernize Plant Tugalo, as approved in the 2019 IRP, and seeks judicial review of the
Georgia PSC's order in the 2022 IRP proceeding with respect to the denial of RCG's challenge to the modernization plan. On November 7, 2022, Georgia Power and the
Georgia PSC both filed motions to dismiss the RCG petition.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power to defer as a regulatory asset the incremental bad debt
resulting from the approved suspension of customer disconnections during certain periods in 2020. The Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a methodology for
identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
incremental

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
costs deferred totaled approximately $25 million and $21 million, respectively. In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved a three-year recovery period ending
December 31, 2025.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation agreement among Georgia Power,
the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition,
Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the
second half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding $200 million. Therefore, in November 2021, the
Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates by 15%, or approximately $252 million annually, effective January 1, 2022.
During 2022, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance continued to increase significantly due to higher fuel and purchased power costs. Georgia Power is scheduled
to file its next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023.
Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $2.1 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in deferred under
recovered fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets.
Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the
use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.
Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated
rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect
operating cash flows.
Storm Damage Recovery
Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. During 2020 through 2022, Georgia Power
recovered $213 million annually under the 2019 ARP. Effective January 1, 2023, Georgia Power is recovering $31 million annually under the 2022 ARP. At
December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's storm damage reserve balance was $83 million and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on Southern Company's
balance sheets and other deferred credits and liabilities on Georgia Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's regulatory asset balance related to
storm damage was $48 million and is included in other regulatory assets, current on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. The rate of storm damage
cost recovery is expected to be adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to
have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 1 under "Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves" for additional
information.
Nuclear Construction
In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, in which Georgia Power currently holds a45.7% ownership interest. In 2012, the NRC
issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of
approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement.
In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing in March 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into several
transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the
Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a
time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and
electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.
In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, under which Bechtel is reimbursed for
actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally
(not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may
terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to
the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk
fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under

(a) Includes approximately $610 million of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners, including $ 33 million of construction monitoring costs approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in
its nineteenth VCM order, and approximately $407 million of incremental costs under the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below. Excludes
financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $421 million, of which $304 million had been accrued through December 31, 2022.
(b) Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $ 188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $.5 billion, of which $3.2 billion had been
incurred through December 31, 2022.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available,
particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics. Southern
Nuclear establishes aggressive target values for monthly construction production and system turnover activities, which are reflected in the site work plans.
Since March 2020, the number of active COVID-19 cases at the site has fluctuated consistent with the surrounding area and impacted productivity levels and pace of
activity completion, with the site experiencing peaks in the number of active cases in January 2021, August 2021, and January 2022. Georgia Power estimates the
productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plans. As
of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction
productivity is estimated to be between $160 million and $200 million and is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Future COVID-19 variants could further
disrupt or delay construction and testing activities.
On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that
the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was
completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023, during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain
equipment and component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot
functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now projected to be placed in service during late fourth
quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.
During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $307 million were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated
with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the
equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost
forecast by $125 million to replenish construction contingency and $9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC
in its nineteenth VCM order.
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to
the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to
income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million after tax), and
$148 million ($110 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate
those expenditures for rate recovery during the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described below.

The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further
equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing
activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes
of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future
challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation; completion of
documentation to support ITAAC submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical
support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost
escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves further into testing and start-up, which may
result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within
the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional
challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and
the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. With the receipt of the
NRC's 103(g) finding, Unit 3 is now subject to the NRC's operating reactor oversight process and must meet applicable technical and operational requirements contained
in its operating license. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation
and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4, may arise, which may result in additional license
amendment requests or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs for
Unit 4, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the
first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts described below, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia
Power of up to $15 million per month for Unit 3 and $35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support
resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related
to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any
further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges
could be material.
Joint Owner Contracts
In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other
conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and
provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership
interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership
Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or
inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of
willful misconduct.
Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements
In connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term
Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG
SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners,
including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a
term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the
provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG
SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet
(Global Amendments).

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its
ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, of which Georgia Power's share is $8.4 billion (VCM 19 Forecast
Amount), plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the
VCM 19 Forecast Amount (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for44.3% of such
costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6
billion and $2.1 billion over the VCM 19 Forecast Amount (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle
Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. The Global Amendments provide that if the EAC is revised
and exceeds the VCM 19 Forecast Amount by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget cost
forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's
remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the VCM 19 Forecast Amount plus $2.1 billion.
For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including epidemics and
quarantines, governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or
financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with
contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than
Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.
In addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if
certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of
certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public
announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of
Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia
Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period
that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension
of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The schedule
extension announced in February 2022 triggered the requirement for a vote to continue construction. Effective February 25, 2022, all of the Vogtle Owners had voted to
continue construction.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender
provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that
they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022,
OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises.
On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia seeking a declaratory
judgment that the starting dollar amount is $17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. The lawsuits also assert other claims,
including breach of contract allegations, and seek, among other remedies, damages and injunctive relief requiring Georgia Power to track and allocate construction costs
consistent with MEAG Power's and OPC's interpretations of the Global Amendments. On July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the
lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and
that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial
obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement
to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement,
among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will
reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure
costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse20% of MEAG
Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. In addition,
MEAG Power agreed to vote to continue

construction upon occurrence of a Project Adverse Event unless the commercial operation date of either of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 or Unit 4 is not projected to occur by
December 31, 2025. On October 4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of settlement and voluntary dismissal of their pending litigation, including
Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022, Dalton dismissed its related complaint.
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of
approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax),
respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million
associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power
does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above. Georgia Power may be required to record further
pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton
based on the current project capital cost forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast
through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of
tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Regulatory Matters
In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC
approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act,
which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual
adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $2.9 billion of
financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion are being recognized through AFUDC and are expected to be recovered through retail rates
over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power is not recording AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the
Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the
NCCR tariff by $36 million annually, effective January 1, 2023.
Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth
VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and
Georgia Power.
In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the
fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report
and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following
regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM
report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion
paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion
would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that
any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the
Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with
Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that a
prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur following Unit 4 fuel load, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR
tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC at that time) to10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from10.00% to

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average
cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt,
effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that effective the first month after Unit 3 reaches commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include the costs
related to Unit 3 and common facilities deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement (see "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding"
herein for additional information). The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1,
2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of
long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $300 million, $270 million,
and $150 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $270 million in 2023 and $60 million in
2024. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are
based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.
In the August 2021 order approving the twenty-fourth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation addressing the following matters: (i) beginning with its
twenty-fifth VCM report, Georgia Power will continue to report to the Georgia PSC all costs incurred during the period for review and will request for approval costs up
to the $7.3 billion determined to be reasonable in the Georgia PSC's seventeenth VCM order and (ii) Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery of the 9.7 billion
increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018. In addition, the
stipulation confirms Georgia Power may request verification and approval of costs above $7.3 billion for inclusion in rate base at a later time, but no earlier than the
prudence review contemplated by the seventeenth VCM order described previously.
The Georgia PSC has approved25 VCM reports covering periods through June 30, 2021. These reports reflect total construction capital costs incurred of $.9 billion (net
of $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds), of which the Georgia PSC
has verified and approved $7.3 billion as described above. The Georgia PSC also has reviewedtwo additional VCM reports, which reflected $1.1 billion of additional
construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2022. Georgia Power expects to file its twenty-eighth VCM report with the Georgia PSC on February 16, 2023,
which will reflect the revised capital cost forecast described above and $461 million of construction capital costs incurred from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a
combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and
purchased power, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the
specific cost recovery clauses are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates.
2019 Base Rate Case
In 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff related to Mississippi Power's base
rate case filed in 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement).
Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased approximately $16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first
billing cycle of April 2020, based on a test year period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, a 53% average equity ratio, an allowed maximum actual equity
ratio of 55% by the end of 2020, and a 7.57% return on investment.
Additionally, the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement: (i) established common amortization periods offour years for regulatory assets and three years for
regulatory liabilities included in the approved revenue requirement, including those related to unprotected deferred income taxes; (ii) established new depreciation rates
reflecting an annual increase in depreciation of approximately $10 million; and (iii) excluded certain compensation costs totaling approximately $3.9 million. It also
eliminated separate rates for costs associated with Plant Ratcliffe and energy efficiency initiatives and includes such costs in the PEP, ECO Plan, and ad valorem tax
adjustment factor, as applicable.
Performance Evaluation Plan
Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term
financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes
II-151

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi Power's performance on a 10-point
scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability,
measured in percentage of time customers had electric service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two
PEP filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing in March of the current year and the PEP lookback filing in March of the subsequent year. The
annual PEP projected filings utilize a historic test year adjusted for "known and measurable" changes and discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine
base ROE. The PEP lookback filing reflects the actual revenue requirement.
Pursuant to a Mississippi PSC-approved settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS, Mississippi Power was not required to make any PEP filings
for the regulatory year 2020.
In June 2021 and June 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filings, resulting in annual increases in revenues of approximately
$16 million, or 1.8%, and $18 million, or 1.9%, respectively, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2021 and April 2022, respectively.
Integrated Resource Plan
In 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement o950 MWs of
fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any
retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future recovery.
In September 2021, the Mississippi PSC concluded its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4268
MWs) and Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively,
consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi
Power's 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs) by the end of 2027. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require the
completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file its
next IRP in April 2024.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $499 million at December 31, 2022 and Mississippi Power is continuing to depreciate
these units using the current approved rates through the end of 2027. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is
expected to total approximately $397 million, to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings,
consistent with the 2020 order. The Plant Watson and Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters - Mississippi Power" for additional information on Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant
retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.
In June 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2021, resulting in a decrease in revenues of approximately 9 million annually
effective with the first billing cycle of July 2021.
On April 5, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2022, resulting in an increase in revenues of approximately $ million annually.
The rate increase became effective with the first billing cycle of May 2022.
On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2023 indicating no change in retail rates. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Mississippi Power annually establishes, and is required to file for an adjustment to, the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. The
Mississippi PSC approved a decrease of $24 million effective in February 2020 and increases of $2 million and $43 million effective in February 2021 and 2022,
respectively. On November 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by $25 million annually effective with
the first billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional $25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi
PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current

billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel recovery balance. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, under recovered retail fuel costs totaled approximately$1 million and $4 million, respectively, and were included in other customer
accounts receivable on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's balance sheets.
Mississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycles for January 202, 2022, and 2023,
annual revenues under the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased $5 million, increased $11 million, and increased $22 million, respectively. The wholesale MB fuel rate did
not change materially in any period presented. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, under recovered wholesale fuel costs were $6 million and $1 million, respectively.
Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost
recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash
flows.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
Mississippi Power annually establishes an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Effective with the first billing cycle of April 2020,
May 2021, and July 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved increases in annual revenues collected through the ad valorem tax adjustment factor of $10 million, $28 million,
and $5 million, respectively. The 2021 increase included approximately $19 million of ad valorem taxes previously recovered through PEP in accordance with the
Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement.
System Restoration Rider
Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However, Mississippi Power is self-insured for the
cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the
FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost of such damage through an annual expense accrual which is credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and
wholesale jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to the reserve. Every year, the
Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power agree on SRR revenue level(s).
Mississippi Power's net retail SRR accrual, which includes carrying costs and amortization of related excess deferred income tax benefits, was 6.9 million in 2022,
$(1.8) million in 2021, and $0.8 million in 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the retail property damage reserve balance was $37 million and $31 million,
respectively.
million
In December 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail revenues of approximately
annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022. The Mississippi PSC also established $8 million as the minimum annual accrual amount until a target
property damage reserve balance of $75 million is met. In the event the expected annual charges exceed the annual accrual or the target balance has been met,
Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC will determine the appropriate change to the annual accrual. Additionally, if PEP earnings are above a certain threshold,
Mississippi Power has the ability to apply any required PEP refund as an additional accrual to the property damage reserve in lieu of customer refunds.
On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its annual SRR filing to the Mississippi PSC, which indicated no change in retail rates. The filing includes a request
to increase the minimum annual accrual from $8 million to $12 million. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Reliability Reserve Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability reserve for the purpose of deferring
generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future year. Mississippi Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve each year
after meeting with the MPUS and Mississippi PSC staff. Mississippi Power will provide annually, through its capital plan, energy delivery plan, or PEP filing, any
amounts to be charged against the reliability reserve during the current year. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued $25 million to the reliability reserve.
Software Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to establish a regulatory asset for certain operations and
maintenance expenditures related to major technology projects. The recovery period for this regulatory asset will be determined in Mississippi Power's annual PEP filing
process. Mississippi Power will begin deferring these costs in 2023.

Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the City of Collins, all located in
southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term, cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.
In 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed, and the FERC accepted, a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part of the MRA tariff, under which
Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy share in providing electricity to the Cooperative Energy delivery points under the tariff. On August 26, 2022, the FERC
accepted an amended SSA between Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use
of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving approximately
400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide 100% of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points
under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA.
On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a $23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff. Cooperative
Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request
effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot bedetermined at
this time.
Southern Company Gas
Utility Regulation and Rate Design
The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to
customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to
recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that
are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable
rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function
of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for
heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that
limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as
those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities
recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception
of Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by
separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See "Rate Proceedings" herein for additional information. Also
see "Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural
gas distribution utilities.

**Nicor Gas**
Illinois legislation allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system through 2023 and stipulates that rate
increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate
revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. In accordance with
orders from the Illinois Commission, Nicor Gas recovers program costs incurred through a separate rider and base rates. The Illinois

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Commission's approval of Nicor Gas' rate case in November 2021 included recovery of program costs through December 31, 2021. See "Rate Proceedings - Nicor Gas"
herein for additional information. Nicor Gas' capital expenditures related to qualifying projects under the Investing in Illinois program totaled $408 million and $389
million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Virginia Natural Gas
The Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, allows Virginia Natural Gas to continue replacing aging
pipeline infrastructure through 2024. The program includes authorized annual investments of $50 million in 2020, $60 million in 2021, and $70 million in each year
from 2022 through 2024, with a total potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over thesix-year term (2019
through 2024) of $365 million. Virginia Natural Gas' capital expenditures under the SAVE program totaled $51 million and $49 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case approved by the Virginia Commission in 2021,
Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to November 1, 2020 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to November 1, 2020 are
currently being recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings.
Atlanta Gas Light
In 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the continuation of GRAM as part of Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized
by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to
upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program
investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The amounts to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs have been recognized in
an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. These allowed costs are primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the
infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM and are being recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the related under recovered
amount or December 31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2022 was $68 million, including $35 million of unrecognized equity return. The Georgia
PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See "Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts" herein for additional information.
Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve
customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million
annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.
See "Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing
and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system
reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024, of which $76 million was incurred in
2022.
Chattanooga Gas
In June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately73 miles of distribution
main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review
mechanism.
Natural Gas Cost Recovery
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use
natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in
purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of
commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the
commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing
factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell
natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas
inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2022, the under recovered
balance was $108 million, which was included in natural gas cost

under recovery on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million
of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and
Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.
Rate Proceedings
Nicor Gas
In November 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included
$94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.
On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $21 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including
$59 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test
year for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2024, a return on equity of10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%. Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an
additional $32 million under three proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois Commission is
expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Atlanta Gas Light
The Georgia PSC evaluates Atlanta Gas Light's earnings against a ROE range of10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by
the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC allows inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not
limited to, GRAM adjustments. GRAM filing rate adjustments are based on an authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020
base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.
In 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $7.6 million based on the projected 12-month
period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021.
In February 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a long-range comprehensive planning
process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each
i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the firstthree years consistent with Atlanta Gas
Light's current capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related revenue
requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system
reliability projects.
In April 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which included a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth
programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital
investments totaling approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.
In November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022
through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM
mechanism, which resulted in a reduction of $5 million for 2022 and $7 million for 2023. The stipulation agreement also provided for $1.7 billion of total capital
investment for the years 2022 through 2024.
Also in November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $3 million effective
January 1, 2022.
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $3 million effective January
1, 2023.

Virginia Natural Gas
In September 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' 2020 general rate case filing, which allowed for a
$43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of9.5% and
an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an
increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth
quarter 2021.
On August 1, 2022, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base rate revenues of $9 million,
including $15 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with
infrastructure, technology, and workforce development. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2023, a ROE of 10.35%,
and an equity ratio of 53.2%. Rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the requested
increase in the third quarter 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts
The following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily
composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in
Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.

3. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS, AND GUARANTEES
General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters
against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not
anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants believe the pending legal challenges discussed below have no merit; however, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Alabama Power
On September 26, 2022, Mobile Baykeeper, through its counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, filed a citizen suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Alabama alleging that Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond utilizing a closure-in-place methodology violates the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) and regulations governing CCR. Among other relief requested, Mobile Baykeeper seeks a declaratory judgment that the RCRA and
regulations governing CCR are being violated, preliminary and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of Alabama Power's closure plan and the development of a
closure plan that satisfies regulations governing CCR requirements. On January 31, 2023, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violations associated with Alabama
Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond. Alabama Power expects to respond by March 2, 2023, subject to any extension agreed upon by the parties. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time but could have an impact on Alabama Power's ARO estimates. See Note 6 for a discussion of Alabama
Power's ARO liabilities.
Georgia Power
Municipal Franchise Fees
In 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that Georgia Power's collection in rates of
amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state law
claims. This case has been ruled upon and appealed numerous times over the last several years. In 2019, the Georgia PSC issued an order that found Georgia Power has
appropriately implemented the municipal franchise fee schedule. In March 2021, the Superior Court of Fulton County granted class certification and Georgia Power's
motion for summary judgment and the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. In April 2021, Georgia Power filed a notice of cross appeal on the issue of class certification. In
December 2021, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Court's ruling that granted summary judgment to Georgia Power and dismissed Georgia Power's
cross appeal on the issue of class certification as moot. Also in December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Georgia Supreme Court, which
was denied on January 27, 2023. On February 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the Georgia Supreme Court. The amount of any possible
losses cannot be estimated at this time because, among other factors, it is unknown whether any losses would be subject to recovery from any municipalities.
Plant Scherer
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint, which was amended on December 9, 2022, in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against
Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer has impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries and property
damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. Georgia Power
has filed multiple motions to dismiss the complaint. On December 29, 2022, the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia granted Georgia Power's motion to transfer
the case to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia.
In October 2021 and on February 7, 2022, a total of seven additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power
alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. In November 2021 and March 2022, Georgia Power removed these cases to the U.S. District
Court for the Middle District of Georgia. On November 16, 2022, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without prejudice. Georgia Power anticipates that
these plaintiffs will refile their complaints.
On January 9, 2023, an additional complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and
operation of Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages,
including punitive damages. On January 19, 2023, Georgia Power filed a notice to remove the case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.

The amount of any possible losses from these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and thethree then-serving members of the
Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was amended in March 2019 to include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi
Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the
Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the
amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were
improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to
$23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages,
punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed the amended complaint; however, in March 2020,
the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional
defendants and add a cause of action against all defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a
motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state
law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the district
court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In January 2021, the district court denied further motions
by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On March 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the
Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the dismissal of the claims against Mississippi Power. On May 31, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied
a petition by Mississippi Power for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further proceedings.
On June 17, 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the complaint. An adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on
Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous
substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric
operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to
clean up known impacted sites in the financial statements. A liability for environmental remediation costs is recognized only when a loss is determined to be probable and
reasonably estimable and is reduced as expenditures are incurred. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and
Georgia have each received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs
through regulatory mechanisms. Any difference between the liabilities accrued and costs recovered through rates is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. These
regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and potential cleanup of such sites is expected. For all years presented,
Georgia Power recovered approximately $12 million annually through the ECCR tariff for environmental remediation under the 2019 ARP. Effective January 1, 2023,
Georgia Power is recovering $5 million annually through the ECCR tariff under the 2022 ARP.
Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with40 former MGP sites in four different states. Southern Company Gas' accrued
environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with these
sites.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for environmental remediation expenses
described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
Acting through the DOE and pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. government entered into contracts with Alabama Power and Georgia Power that
required the DOE to dispose of spent nuclear fuel generated at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 beginning no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE has yet
to commence the performance of its contractual and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and
continue to pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.

In 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed lawsuits against the U.S. government for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and
Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. In 2019,
the Court of Federal Claims granted Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment on damages not disputed by the U.S. government, awarding
those undisputed damages to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. However, those undisputed damages are not collectible until the court enters final judgment on the
remaining damages.

In 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed additional lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims for the costs of continuing to store
spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. In 2020, Alabama Power and
Georgia Power filed amended complaints in each of the lawsuits adding damages from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 to the claim period.

The outstanding claims for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019 total $ 10 million and $132 million for Alabama Power and Georgia Power (based on
its ownership interests), respectively. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia
Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial
statements as of December 31, 2022 for any potential recoveries from the pending lawsuits.

The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit any recoveries for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.

On-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all three plants and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of each plant.

Nuclear Insurance

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies' nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $13.7 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $450 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $138 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $20 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is $275 million and $330 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of $41 million and $49 million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2023. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information on joint ownership agreements.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $1.5 billion for members' operating nuclear generating facilities. Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $1.25 billion for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to $750 million for non-nuclear losses in excess of the $1.5 billion primary coverage.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a 12-week deductible waiting period for each nuclear plant.

A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to $2.75 billion for accidental property damage occurring during construction.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 under the NEIL policies would be $51 million and $85 million, respectively.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy limits). The maximum aggregate that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events in any 12-month period is $3.2 billion each, plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes

Other Matters
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
In April 2019, Bellsouth Telecommunications d/b/a AT&T Alabama (AT&T) filed a complaint against Alabama Power with the FCC alleging that the pole rental rate
AT&T is required to pay pursuant to the parties' joint use agreement is unjust and unreasonable under federal law. The complaint sought a new rate and approximately
$87 million in refunds of alleged overpayments for the preceding six years. In August 2019, the FCC stayed the case in favor of arbitration, which AT&T has not
pursued. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but an adverse outcome could have a material impact on the financial statements of
Southern Company and Alabama Power. Georgia Power and Mississippi Power have joint use agreements with other AT&T affiliates.
Mississippi Power
Kemper County Energy Facility
In 2020, 2021, and 2022, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income associated with abandonment and related closure costs and ongoing period costs, net of salvage
proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. These charges, including related tax impacts, totaled $4 million pre-tax ($3
million after tax) in 2020, $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after tax) in 2021, and $15 million pre-tax ($12 million after tax) in 2022. The pre-tax charges are included in
other operations and maintenance expenses on the statements of income.
Dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed by 2026. Additional pre-tax period costs associated
with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes, net of salvage, are estimated to
total approximately $15 million annually through 2025.
Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine located around the Kemper County energy facility site. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine
reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028.
As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, has a legal obligation to perform mine
reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. See Note 6 for additional information.
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the
project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of $137 million were awarded to the Kemper County
energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants
received. In 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which enabled Mississippi
Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, in
2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of an investigation related to the grants received. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Plant Daniel
In conjunction with Southern Company's 2019 sale of Gulf Power, NextEra Energy held back $75 million of the purchase price pending Mississippi Power and NextEra
Energy negotiating a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. On July 12, 2022, the co-owners executed a revised operating agreement and
Southern Company subsequently received the remaining $75 million of the purchase price. The dispatch procedures in the revised operating agreement for thetwo
jointly-owned coal units at Plant Daniel resulted in Mississippi Power designating one of the two units as primary and the other as secondary in lieu of each company
separately owning 100% of a single generating unit. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase its co-owner's ownership interest for $ on January 15, 2024, provided
that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. The revised operating agreement did not have a material impact on Mississippi
Power's financial statements. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power - Integrated Resource Plan" for additional information on Plant Daniel.
Department of Revenue Audit
On August 31, 2022, the Mississippi Department of Revenue (Mississippi DOR) completed an audit of sales and use taxes paid by Mississippi Power from 2016 to 2019
and entered a final assessment, indicating a total amount due of $28 million, including

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
associated penalties and interest. Mississippi Power does not agree with the audit findings and, on October 27, 2022, filed an administrative appeal with the Mississippi
DOR.
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to defer the additional taxes and related interest related to the
audit to a regulatory asset, excluding amounts associated with the gasifier and other abandoned Kemper IGCC assets. The authority to defer these costs is not a guarantee
of recovery. The review and final disposition of the costs recorded to the regulatory asset will be addressed in a future rate proceeding following completion of the tax
audit proceedings.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Commitments
To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the Southern Company system's electric generating plants, the Southern Company system has entered into various long-
term commitments not recognized on the balance sheets for the procurement and delivery of fossil fuel and, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, nuclear fuel. The
majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its
future fuel needs will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.
Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a5% interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by
MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership
interest. The payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle
Units 1 and 2 investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the
disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power,
non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income. Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $4 million, $6 million, and $5 million in
2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $41 million, consisting
of $3 million for 2023, $4 million annually for 2024 and 2025, $2 million annually for 2026 and 2027, and $26 million thereafter.
See Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.
Southern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable through natural gas cost recovery
mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas. Gas supply commitments include amounts for gas commodity purchases associated with Nicor
Gas and SouthStar of 34 million mmBtu at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2022 and valued at $57 million. Southern
Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations. Southern Company Gas' expected future
contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not recognized on the balance sheets at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

Alabama Power has guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan SEGCO entered into in 2018 and subsequently extended and amended. Georgia
Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligation corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate ownership of SEGCO's stock if
Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment under its guarantee. At December 31, 2022, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $80 million of equity and
$100 million of long-term debt that matures in November 2024, on which the annual interest requirement is derived from a variable rate index. In addition, SEGCO had
short-term debt outstanding of $17 million. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
As discussed in Note 9, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees related to railcar leases.
4. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources, some of which are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers, such as leases, derivatives,
and certain cost recovery mechanisms. See Note 1 under "Revenues" for additional information on the revenue policies of the Registrants. See Notes 9 and 14 for
additional information on revenue accounted for under lease and derivative accounting guidance, respectively.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Georgia Power had contract assets primarily related to retail customer fixed bill programs, where the payment is contingent upon
Georgia Power's continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service agreements,
where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract liabilities for Georgia Power relate to cash collections recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated
service agreements. Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $65 million and $50 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, and contract liabilities of $32 million and $39 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for outstanding performance obligations.

Revenues recognized in 2022 and 2021, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, were $6 million and
$29 million, respectively, for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants.

<b>Remaining Performance Obligations</b>
The Subsidiary Registrants have long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over the contract term. For
the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily relate to PPAs whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a
customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable; however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of
the contract. For Southern Company Gas, these contracts involve energy infrastructure enhancement and upgrade projects for certain governmental customers. Southern
Company's unregulated distributed generation business also has partially satisfied performance obligations related to certain fixed price contracts. Revenues from
contracts with customers related to these performance obligations remaining at December 31, 2022 are expected to be recognized as follows:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to other operations and maintenance expenses as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs and certain maintenance costs including
those described below.

In accordance with orders from their respective state PSCs, Alabama Power and Georgia Power defer nuclear refueling outage operations and maintenance expenses to a
regulatory asset when the charges are incurred. Alabama Power amortizes the costs

over a subsequent 18-month period with Plant Farley's fall outage cost amortization beginning in January of the following year and spring outage cost amortization
beginning in July of the same year. Georgia Power amortizes its costs over each unit's operating cycle, or 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 24 months for
Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's amortization period begins the month the refueling outage starts.
A portion of Mississippi Power's railway track maintenance costs is charged to fuel stock and recovered through Mississippi Power's fuel clause.
The portion of Southern Company Gas' non-working gas used to maintain the structural integrity of natural gas storage facilities that is considered to be non-recoverable
is depreciated, while the recoverable or retained portion is not depreciated.
See Note 9 for information on finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, net, which are included in property, plant, and equipment.
The Registrants have deferred certain implementation costs related to cloud hosting arrangements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred cloud implementation
costs, net of amortization, which are generally included in other deferred charges and assets on the Registrants' balance sheets, are as follows:

Once a hosted software is placed into service, the related deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term,
including any renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise. The amortization is reflected with the associated cloud hosting fees, which are generally reflected
in other operations and maintenance expenses on the Registrants' statements of income. In 2022, amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs recognized was
$29 million for Southern Company, $8 million for Alabama Power, $12 million for Georgia Power, and immaterial for the other Registrants. In 2021, amortization from
deferred cloud implementation costs was immaterial for all Registrants.
See Note 2 under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," "Alabama Power - Software Accounting Order," and "Mississippi Power - Software Accounting Order" for
information on deferrals of certain other operations and maintenance costs associated with software and cloud computing projects by the traditional electric operating
companies and natural gas distribution utilities, as authorized by their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies.
Depreciation and Amortization
The traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates. The approximate rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>2022</th>
    <th>2021</th>
    <th>2020</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alabama Power</td>
    <td>2.7%</td>
    <td>2.7%</td>
    <td>2.6%</td>

    <td>Southern Company Gas</td>
    <td>2.7%</td>
    <td>2.8%</td>
    <td>2.8%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are filed with the respective state PSC and/or other applicable state and
federal regulatory agencies for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities. Effective April 1, 2020, Mississippi Power's
depreciation rates were revised. Effective January 1, 2023, Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's depreciation rates were revised. See Note 2 for additional information.
When property, plant, and equipment subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together
with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the balance sheet accounts, and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the asset are retired when the related
property unit is retired.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, accumulated depreciation for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consisted of utility plant in service totaling $34.3 billion
and $33.1 billion, respectively, for Southern Company and $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, for Southern Company Gas, as well as other plant in service totaling
$963 million and $930 million, respectively, for Southern Company and $184 million and $219 million, respectively, for Southern Company Gas. Other plant in service
includes the non-utility assets of Southern Company Gas, as well as, for Southern Company, certain other non-utility subsidiaries. Depreciation of the original cost of
other plant in service is provided primarily on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives. Useful lives for Southern Company Gas's non-utility assets range from five
to 12 years for transportation equipment, 30 to 75 years for storage facilities, and up to 75 years for other assets. Useful lives for the assets of Southern Company's other
non-utility subsidiaries range up to 30 years.
Southern Power
Southern Power applies component depreciation, where depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Certain of Southern Power's generation assets related to natural gas-fired facilities are depreciated on a units-of-production basis, using hours or starts, to better match
outage and maintenance costs to the usage of, and revenues from, these assets. The primary assets in Southern Power's property, plant, and equipment are generating
facilities, which generally have estimated useful lives as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Southern Power Generating Facility</td>
    <td>Useful life</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Natural gas</td>
    <td>Up to 50 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Solar</td>
    <td>Up to 35 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wind</td>
    <td>Up to 35 years<sup>(*)</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

(*) Effective January 1, 2022, Southern Power revised the depreciable lives of its wind generating facilities from up to 30 years to up to 35 years. This revision resulted in an immaterial decrease in
depreciation for 2022.
When Southern Power's depreciable property, plant, and equipment is retired, or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, the applicable cost and
accumulated depreciation is removed and a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of income. Southern Power reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values
on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could result in changes which could have a material impact on Southern Power's net income.

6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The
estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are
estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free
rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal
activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state
regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly,
the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance
sheets as regulatory assets.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally
ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant
Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See "Nuclear Decommissioning" herein for additional information. Other
significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation
for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the
restoration of land at the end of the lease.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric
transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain
wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and
property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded
because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot
be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation
of the ARO.
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in
accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental
obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.

(*) Included in other deferred credits and liabilities on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheets.

During 2021, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $406 million to its AROs primarily related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule based on
updated estimates for post-closure costs at its ash ponds and inflation rates.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During 2021, Georgia Power refined the cost estimates related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the
related state rule, including updates to estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure activities, and recorded an increase of approximately $435 million to its
AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In December 2022, Georgia Power recorded a net decrease of approximately $780 million to its AROs related
to the CCR Rule and the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including lower future inflation rates, higher discount rates, and timing of closure
activities, as well as a change in closure methodology for one ash pond as approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power - Integrated
Resource Plans" for additional information.
During 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on updated estimates for the timing of
closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2022 using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure
costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional
electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit
as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-
place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by
environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.
Nuclear Decommissioning
The NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities.
The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as
the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers, neither Southern Company nor its
subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the
investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third-party managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers
are authorized, within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on the Funds' investments.
The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as trading securities.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as management believes that fair value best
represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not
included in net income or OCI. Fair value adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
The Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program, Georgia Power's Funds' investment
securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the
U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $35 million and $42 million, respectively, of the fair market value
of Georgia Power's Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the collateral received
was approximately $36 million and $43 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and can only be sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned
securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements of cash flows.

The investment securities held in the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales within the Funds are presented
separately in the statements of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of the securities and purpose for which the securities were acquired.

For Alabama Power, approximately $14 million and $15 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, previously recorded in internal reserves is being
transferred into the Funds through 2040 as approved by the Alabama PSC.

The NRC's minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on
the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds
will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning,
changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in making these estimates. The estimated costs of decommissioning at December 31, 2022 based on
the most current studies, which were performed in 2018 for Alabama Power and in 2021 for Georgia Power, were as follows:

(*) Based on Georgia Power's ownership interests.

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic
estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2021. Significant assumptions used to
determine these costs for ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust
earnings rate of 7.0% and 4.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. The next site study for Alabama Power is expected to be completed later in 2023.
Alabama Power's site-specific estimates of decommissioning costs for Plant Farley are updated everyfive years. Projections of funds are reviewed with the Alabama PSC
to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide adequate funding to cover the site-specific costs. If necessary, Alabama Power would seek
the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.

Under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking was a total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Effective
January 1, 2023, as approved in the 2022 ARP, there is no annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking. Any funding amount required by the NRC during the period
covered by the 2022 ARP will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovery is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. See Note 2 under
"Georgia Power - Rate Plans - 2022 ARP" for additional information.

7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are
evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. If a venture is a VIE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the
entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.

Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate
consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence,
but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern
Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See "SEGCO" and
"Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.
Southern Company
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $112 million and $101 million, respectively, primarily related to
investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.
SEGCO
Alabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity off,020
MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is expected to occur by December 31, 2028. Alabama Power and Georgia
Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia
Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased
power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $124 million in 2022, $75 million in 2021, and $67 million in 2020 for Alabama Power
and $127 million in 2022, $77 million in 2021, and $69 million in 2020 for Georgia Power.
SEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2022, $14 million in 2021, and $12 million in 2020, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia
Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.
Alabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of
an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.
See Note 3 under "Guarantees" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most
significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of
its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
SP Solar is owned by Southern Power and Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general
partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a66% ownership interest. Global Atlantic is the limited
partner and holds the remaining 33% noncontrolling interest. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the33% limited
partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, SP Solar had total assets of $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $0.4 billion, and noncontrolling interests of
$1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all
such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.
SP Wind is owned by Southern Power and three financial investors. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns100% of the Class B membership interests and
the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind
II-177

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out rights against
Southern Power.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, SP Wind had total assets of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $169 million and $130 million, respectively,
and noncontrolling interests of $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Under the terms of the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member
consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated
in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power and 40% to
the three financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities of each entity, including operating
and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to partner consent and the liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of
Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working capital items and do not include any long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax equity investors or acquired less than a
100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the arrangements are structured similar to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling
members do not have substantive kick-out rights.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the other VIEs had total assets of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively,
and noncontrolling interests of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Under the terms of the partnership agreements, distributions of all available cash are required
each month or quarter and additional distributions require partner consent.
Equity Method Investments
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Power had equity method investments in wind and battery energy storage projects totaling $49 million and $86 million,
respectively. Earnings (loss) from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented. During 2022, Southern Power sold equity method investments in wind
projects and received proceeds totaling $38 million. The gains associated with the sales were immaterial. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, Southern Power sold its
remaining equity method investments in wind and battery energy storage projects and received proceeds of $50 million. The gains associated with the transactions were
immaterial.

PennEast Pipeline Project
In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an interstate pipeline company formed to
develop and operate an approximate 118-mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline
does not have federal eminent domain authority over lands in which a state has property rights interests. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PennEast
Pipeline following a review of the appellate court decision. Southern Company Gas assesses its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the investment may be impaired. Following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, during the second quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas
management reassessed the project construction timing, including the anticipated timing for receipt of a FERC certificate and all remaining state and local permits, as
well as potential challenges thereto, and performed an impairment analysis. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $82 million
($58 million after tax). In September 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project was no longer supported, and, as a result, all further
development of the project ceased. During the third quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $2 million ($2 million after tax)
related to its share of the project level impairment, as well as $7 million of additional tax expense, resulting in total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax)
during 2021 related to the project.

(a) See notes (b) and (c) below.
(b) Amounts include principal amortization related to the FFB borrowings; however, the final maturity date is February 20, 2044. See "DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" herein for additional information.
(c) Southern Power's 2026 maturities include $564 million of euro-denominated debt at the U.S. dollar denominated hedge settlement amount.

**DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings**

Pursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into a loan guarantee agreement in 2014 and the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement in 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized to make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion, provided that total aggregate borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities could not exceed 70% of (i) Eligible Project Costs minus (ii) approximately $1.492 billion (reflecting the amounts received by Georgia Power under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement less the related customer refunds).

In 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities andno further borrowings are permitted. During 2022, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $88 million under the FFB Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Georgia Power had $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.

All borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE are full recourse and secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units under construction, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and (ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.

The final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and principal payments began in February 2020. Each borrowing under the FFB Credit Facilities bears interest at a fixed rate equal to the applicable U.S. Treasury rate at the time of the borrowing plus a spread equal to 0.375%.

Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other project-specific covenants and events of default.

In the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) the termination of the Vogtle Services Agreement or rejection of the Vogtle Services Agreement in any Westinghouse bankruptcy if Georgia Power does not maintain access to intellectual property rights under the related intellectual property licenses; (ii) termination of the Bechtel Agreement, unless the Vogtle Owners enter into a replacement agreement; (iii) cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the Georgia PSC or by Georgia Power; (iv) failure of the holders of 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to vote to continue construction following certain schedule extensions; (v) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; or (vi) loss of or failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Georgia Power also may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In connection with any cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the DOE may elect to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In such an event, the DOE
will have the right to assume Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal agreements relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to acquire all or a portion
of Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
See Note 2 under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Secured Debt
Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. There are no agreements or
other arrangements among the Southern Company system companies under which the assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy
obligations of Southern Company or any of its other subsidiaries.
As discussed under "Long-term Debt" herein, the Registrants had secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Each Registrant's senior notes, junior
subordinated notes, revenue bond obligations, bank term loans, credit facility borrowings, and notes payable are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of each
respective Registrant.
Equity Units
In May 2022, Southern Company remarketed $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2019A Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes due August 1,
2024 (2019A RSNs) and $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2019B Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes due August 1, 2027 (2019B RSNs),
pursuant to the terms of its 2019 Series A Equity Units (Equity Units). In connection with the remarketing, the interest rates on the 2019A RSNs and the 2019B RSNS
were reset to 4.475% and 5.113%, respectively, payable on a semi-annual basis. On August 1, 2022, the proceeds were ultimately used to settle the purchase contracts
entered into as part of the Equity Units and Southern Company issued approximately 25.2 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $1.725 billion. At
December 30, 2022 and 2021, the 2019A RSNs and the 2019B RSNs are included in long-term debt on Southern Company's consolidated balance sheets.

(a) Does not include Southern Power Company's two $ 75 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $ 9 million and $5 million, respectively, was unused at
December 31, 2022. In December 2022, Southern Power amended one of the $75 million letter of credit facilities, which extended the expiration date from 2023 to 2025. The second $ 75 million
letter of credit facility also expires in 2025. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b) Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $ 800 million of the credit arrangement expiring in 2026.
Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor
Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2026, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted. Nicor Gas is also the borrower under a
$250 million credit arrangement expiring in 2023. See "Structural Considerations" herein for additional information.
The bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment fees average less than¹/4 of 1% for
the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements
as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending
commitments thereunder.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain
cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the
indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on
indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the
applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit
arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements
contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes junior subordinated
notes and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these definitions, debt excludes any
project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or
other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the
bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial
paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding
requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia
Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $288 million,
respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months.
At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Power had $106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements, which is included in other deferred
charges and assets on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Payable
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed
bank credit arrangements described above under "Bank Credit Arrangements." Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties or obligors to its commercial paper program.
Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and at Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports
working capital needs at Nicor Gas as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other subsidiaries benefit from
Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. See "Structural Considerations" herein for additional information.
In addition, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various bank term loan agreements. Unless otherwise stated, the proceeds of these loans
were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including working capital and, for the subsidiaries, their continuous construction programs.

Diluted Earnings Per Share
For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is attributable to awards outstanding under stock-based
compensation plans. Earnings per share dilution resulting from stock-based compensation plans is determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute
diluted EPS were as follows:

<thead>
<tr>

In all years presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because the awards were anti-dilutive.
Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries
As discussed further under "Alabama Power" herein, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power at December 31, 2021 is presented as
"Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries" on Southern Company's balance sheet in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting
standards. During 2022, Alabama Power redeemed all of its preferred stock and Class A preferred stock.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding at December 31,

Prior to being redeemed, Alabama Power's preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference between classes, ranked senior to Alabama Power's common
stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary and involuntary dissolution. The preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power contained a
feature that allowed the holders to elect a majority of Alabama Power's board of directors if preferred dividends were not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because
such a potential redemption-triggering event was not solely within the control of Alabama Power, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock at December 31, 2021
is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock" on Alabama Power's balance sheet in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power has preferred stock and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding

Dividend Restrictions
The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, consolidated retained earnings included $4.9
billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.
See Note 7 under "Southern Power" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power subsidiaries.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money
pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payment totaled $1.5 billion.
Structural Considerations
Since Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas and, hence, the right of
creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern
Company Gas, whether upon liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.
Southern Company Gas' 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing
needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and
unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern
Company Gas Capital for its financing needs.
Southern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangementare unsecured senior indebtedness, which rank equally with all
other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of
these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of
creditors of Southern Power's subsidiaries.

9. LEASES
Lessee
The Registrants recognize leases with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as lease obligations, representing the discounted future fixed payments due,
along with ROU assets that will be amortized over the term of each lease.
As lessee, the Registrants lease certain electric generating units (including renewable energy facilities), real estate/land, communication towers, railcars, and other
equipment and vehicles. The major categories of lease obligations are as follows:

|                                       | Southern Company | Alabama Power | Georgia Power | Mississippi Power | Southern Power | Southern Company Gas |

(*) Amounts related to affiliate leases are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company. See "Contracts that Contain a Lease" herein for additional information.
Real estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas and various land leases
primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial real estate leases have remaining terms of up to 23 years while the land leases
have remaining terms of up to 44 years, including renewal periods.
Communication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support the automated meter infrastructure
programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower leases have remaining terms of up to 10 years with options to renew that
could extend the terms for an additional 20 years.
Renewal options exist in many of the leases. Except as otherwise noted, the expected term used in calculating the lease obligation generally reflects only the
noncancelable period of the lease as it is not considered reasonably certain that the lease will be extended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at
Southern Power and communication tower leases for automated meter infrastructure at Nicor Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an
expected lease term at least equal to the expected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure, respectively.
Contracts that Contain a Lease
While not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a lease of the underlying electric generating
units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based
on the amount of scheduled capacity payments due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between one and 17 years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with
Southern Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of $461 million and $521 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length transaction as reviewed and approved by the Georgia PSC.
Amounts related to the affiliate PPAs are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company.

Short-term Leases
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Registrants generally recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
Residual Value Guarantees
Residual value guarantees exist primarily in railcar leases at Alabama Power and Georgia Power and the amounts probable of being paid under those guarantees are
included in the lease payments. All such amounts are immaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Lease and Nonlease Components
For all asset categories, with the exception of electric generating units, gas pipelines, and real estate leases, the Registrants combine lease payments and any nonlease
components, such as asset maintenance, for purposes of calculating the lease obligation and the right-of-use asset.
Balance sheet amounts recorded for operating and finance leases are as follows:

Payments made under PPAs at Georgia Power for energy generated from certain renewable energy facilities accounted for as operating and finance leases are considered
variable lease costs and are therefore not reflected in the above maturity analysis.
Lessor
The Registrants are each considered lessors in various arrangements that have been determined to contain a lease due to the customer's ability to control the use of the
underlying asset owned by the applicable Registrant. For the traditional electric operating companies, these arrangements consist of outdoor lighting contracts accounted
for as operating leases with initial terms of up to seven years, after which the contracts renew on a month-to-month basis at the customer's option. For Mississippi Power,
these arrangements also include a tolling arrangement related to an electric generating unit accounted for as a sales-type lease with a remaining term of 16 years. For
Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including solar and wind facilities, accounted for as operating leases with
remaining terms of up to 24 years and PPAs related to battery energy storage facilities accounted for as sales-type leases with remaining terms of up to19 years. Southern
Company Gas is the lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 20 years. For Southern Company, these arrangements also include
PPAs related to fuel cells accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 11 years.
Lease income for 2022, 2021, and 2020, is as follows:

Mississippi Power has a tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease. During 2020 and 2021, Mississippi Power completed construction of additional leased
assets under the lease and, upon completion, the book values of $26 million and $39 million, respectively, were transferred from CWIP to lease receivables. Each transfer
represented a non-cash investing transaction for purposes of the statements of cash flows.
During 2021, Southern Power completed construction of a portion of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities' assets and recorded losses totaling
$40 million upon commencement of the related PPAs, which Southern Power accounts for as sales-type leases. The losses were due to ITCs retained and expected to be
realized by Southern Power and its partners in these projects, and no estimated residual asset value was assumed in calculating the losses. Each lease had an initial term of
20 years. Upon commencement of the leases, the book values of the related assets totaling $210 million were derecognized from CWIP and lease receivables were
recorded. The transfers represented noncash investing transactions for purposes of the statement of cash flows. See Note 15 under "Southern Power" for additional
information.
The undiscounted cash flows expected to be received for in-service leased assets under the leases are as follows:

Southern Power receives payments for renewable energy under PPAs accounted for as operating leases that are considered contingent rents and are therefore not
reflected in the table above. Alabama Power and Southern Power allocate revenue to the nonlease components of PPAs based on the stand-alone selling price of capacity
and energy. The undiscounted cash flows to be received under outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases at Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are
immaterial.

Southern Company Leveraged Lease
At December 31, 2020, a subsidiary of Southern Holdings hadfour leveraged lease agreements related to energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets,
including two domestic and two international projects. During 2021, one of the domestic projects was sold and the agreements for both international projects were
terminated. At December 31, 2022, the one remaining leveraged lease agreement, which relates to energy generation, had an expected remaining term ofnine years.
Southern Company continues to receive federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to this investment.
Southern Company wrote off the related investment balance in 2020, as discussed below.
During the second quarter 2020, following an evaluation of the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets at the end of
the lease, Southern Company management concluded it was no longer probable that any of the associated rental payments scheduled after 2032 would be received,
because it was no longer probable the generation assets would be successfully remarketed and continue to operate after that date. Revising the estimated cash flows to be
received under the leveraged lease to reflect this conclusion resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to earnings of $154 million ($74
million after tax).
The following table provides a summary of the components of income related to leveraged lease investments. Income was impacted in 2021 and 2020 by the impairment
charges discussed below and in Note 15 under "Southern Company." Income in 2021 does not include the impacts of the sale and terminations of leveraged lease projects
discussed in Note 15 under "Southern Company."

On June 30, 2022, the Southern Holdings subsidiary operating the generating plant for the lessee provided notice to the lessee to terminate the related operating and
maintenance agreement effective June 30, 2023. The parties to the lease agreement are currently negotiating a potential restructuring, which could result in rescission of
the termination notice. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's
financial statements.
The lessee failed to make the semi-annual lease payment due December 15, 2022. As a result, the Southern Holdings subsidiary was unable to make its corresponding
payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. The parties to the lease have entered into a forbearance agreement which
suspends the related contractual rights of the parties while they continue restructuring negotiations. As the remaining amount of Southern Company's lease investment
was charged against earnings in the second quarter 2020, termination would not be expected to result in additional charges. Southern Company will continue to monitor
the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments and meet its obligations
associated with a future closure or retirement of the generation assets and associated properties, including the dry ash landfill.
10. INCOME TAXES
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under
a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis, and each
subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is
jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability.

Southern Company's and Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs generated in the current tax year and carried forward from prior tax years that cannot be utilized in the current
tax year are reclassified from current to deferred taxes in federal income tax expense in the tables above. Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs reclassified in this manner
include $17 million for 2022, $6 million for 2021, and $5 million for 2020. Southern Power received $49 million, $289 million, and $340 million of cash related to
federal ITCs

under renewable energy initiatives in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities" herein for additional information.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies are amortized over the average life of the related
property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas
distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. ITCs
amortized in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were immaterial for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas and were as follows for Southern
Company and Southern Power:

When Southern Power recognizes tax credits, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has
elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation.
State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's income tax expense by $53 million in
2022, $66 million in 2021, and $67 million in 2020.
Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern Power's income tax expense by $27
million in 2022, $16 million in 2021, and $15 million in 2020.

Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable AFUDC equity at the
traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs
primarily at Southern Power.
In July 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent. As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in $5 million of
additional net state tax expense. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:

# COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have tax-related regulatory assets (deferred income tax charges) and regulatory
liabilities (deferred income tax credits). The regulatory assets are primarily attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years, deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates lower than the current enacted tax law, and taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The regulatory liabilities are primarily attributable to
deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized ITCs. See Note 2 for each Registrant's related balances at
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
## Tax Credit Carryforwards
Federal ITC/PTC carryforwards at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
   <th></th>
   <th>Southern Company</th>
   <th>Alabama Power</th>
   <th>Georgia Power</th>

   <td>2026</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The estimated tax credit utilization reflects the various sale transactions described in Note 15 and could be further delayed by numerous factors, including the acquisition
of additional renewable projects, the purchase of rights to additional PTCs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 pursuant to certain joint ownership agreements, an increase in
Georgia Power's ownership interest percentage in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, changes in taxable income projections, and potential income tax rate changes. See Note 2
under "Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction" for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power also had approximately $434 million in net state investment and other net state tax credit carryforwards for the State of Georgia
that will expire between tax years 2022 and 2031 and are not expected to be fully utilized. Georgia Power has a net state valuation allowance of $98 million associated
with these carryforwards.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
## Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2020 primarily relates to a 2019 state tax filing position to exclude certain gains from 2019 dispositions
from taxation in a certain unitary state. It is possible that this position will be resolved in the next 12 months, and if accepted by the state, this position would decrease
Southern Company's annual effective tax rate.
The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2022 is primarily related to the amendment of certain 2018 state tax filing positions related to Southern
Company Gas dispositions. If accepted by the states, these positions would decrease Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' annual effective tax rates. The
ultimate outcome of these unrecognized tax benefits is dependent on acceptance by each state and is not expected to be resolved within the next 12 months.
All of the Registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions was immaterial for all years presented. None of the
Registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2021. Southern Company is a participant in the Compliance
Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the Registrants' state income tax returns have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior
to 2015.
11. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the exception of PowerSecure
employees. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No
contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2022 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated
for the year ending December 31, 2023. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of management and highly
compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their
respective regulatory commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care and life
insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2023, no contributions to any other postretirement trusts are expected.

The Registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial model to project the expected return on
each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the
entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated
returns by asset class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact of a periodic
rebalancing of each trust's portfolio. The Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using an arithmetic mean which represents the expected simple average
return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. The Registrants believe the use of the arithmetic mean is more compatible with the expected rate of
return's function of estimating a single year's investment return.

An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) was a weighted average medical care cost trend rate. The
weighted average medical care cost trend rates used in measuring the APBO for the Registrants at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

|               | Initial Cost Trend Rate | Ultimate Cost Trend Rate | Year That Ultimate Rate is Reached |
|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pre-65        | 6.60%                   | 4.50%                    | 2030                               |
| Post-65 medical | 5.50                    | 4.50                     | 2030                               |
| Post-65 prescription | 7.50                    | 4.50                     | 2031                               |

Pension Plans
The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:

|               | Southern Company | Alabama Power | Georgia Power | Mississippi Power | Southern Power | Southern Company Gas |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
|               |                 |               |               | (in millions)   |                |                      |
| December 31, 2022 | $ 11,422        | $ 2,601       | $ 3,534       | $ 520           | $ 135          | $ 801                |
| December 31, 2021 | 14,687          | 3,362         | 4,562         | 672             | 178            | 1,030                |

Actuarial gains of $3.9 billion and $393 million were recorded for the annual remeasurement of the Southern Company system pension plans at December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively, primarily due to increases of 216 basis points and 28 basis points, respectively, in the overall discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation as a
result of higher market interest rates.
Changes in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets during the plan years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic pension cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants’ statements of income.

Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

The service cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants' statements of income.
The Registrants' future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, are provided in the table below. These amounts reflect expected future service and are
estimated based on assumptions used to measure the APBO for the other postretirement benefit plans.

Benefit Plan Assets
Pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements, including ERISA and the Internal
Revenue Code. The Registrants' investment policies for both the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans cover a diversified mix of assets as described
below. Derivative instruments may be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes and as hedging tools. Additionally, the Registrants minimize the risk of
large losses primarily through diversification but also monitor and manage other aspects of risk.
The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Southern Company system's qualified pension plan is to be broadly diversified across major asset classes. The asset
allocation is established after consideration of various factors that affect the assets and liabilities of the pension plan including, but not limited to, historical and expected
returns and interest rates, volatility, correlations of asset classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and liabilities. Because a
significant portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment expectations for return and risk.
To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Southern Company system employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk
management, external investment managers and service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices. Management
believes the portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of risk.
Southern Company's investment strategy also includes adjusting the established asset allocation to invest a larger portion of the portfolio in fixed rate debt securities
should the qualified pension plan achieve a predetermined funding threshold, which occurred during 2022.
Investment Strategies and Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values
A description of the major asset classes that the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are comprised of, along with the valuation methods used for fair value
measurement, is provided below:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Valuation Methodology</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Domestic equity:</b> A mix of large and small capitalization stocks with generally
an equal distribution of value and growth attributes, managed both actively and
through passive index approaches.</td>
      <td>Domestic and international equities such as common stocks, American depositary
receipts, and real estate investment trusts that trade on public exchanges are classified
as Level 1 investments and are valued at the closing price in the active market. Equity
funds with unpublished prices that are comprised of publicly traded securities (such as
commingled/pooled funds) are also valued at the closing price in the active market,
but are classified as Level 2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>International equity:</b> A mix of large and small capitalization growth and value
stocks with developed and emerging markets exposure, managed both actively
and through fundamental indexing approaches.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Fixed income:</b> A mix of domestic and international bonds.</td>
      <td>Investments in fixed income securities, including fixed income pooled funds, are
generally classified as Level 2 investments and are valued based on prices reported in
the market place. Additionally, the value of fixed income securities takes into
consideration certain items such as broker quotes, spreads, yield curves, interest rates,
and discount rates that apply to the term of a specific instrument.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trust-owned life insurance (TOLI):</b> Investments of taxable trusts aimed at
minimizing the impact of taxes on the portfolio.</td>
      <td>Investments in TOLI policies are classified as Level 2 investments and are valued
based on the underlying investments held in the policy's separate accounts. The
underlying assets are equity and fixed income pooled funds that are comprised of
Level 1 and Level 2 securities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Real estate:</b> Investments in traditional private market, equity-oriented
investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled funds or partnerships)
and in publicly traded real estate securities.</td>
      <td>Investments in real estate, special situations, and private equity are generally
classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient, since the underlying assets
typically do not have publicly available observable inputs. The fund manager values
the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the
underlying investments. Techniques may include purchase multiples for comparable
transactions, comparable public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow
analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of comparable
investments, and independent third-party appraisals. The fair value of partnerships is
determined by aggregating the value of the underlying assets less liabilities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Special situations:</b> Investments in opportunistic strategies with the objective of
diversifying and enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as
well as investments in promising new strategies of a longer-term nature.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Private equity:</b> Investments in private partnerships that invest in private or public
securities typically through privately-negotiated and/or structured transactions,
including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed debt.</td>

12. STOCK COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation primarily in the form of Southern Company performance share units (PSU) and restricted stock units (RSU) may be granted through the
Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan to Southern Company system employees ranging from line management to executives.
At December 31, 2022, the number of current and former employees participating in stock-based compensation programs for the Registrants was as follows:

Southern Company Alabama Power
Georgia Power
Mississippi Power
Southern Company
Southern Power
Gas
45
186
Number of employees
1,586
221
236
64

The majority of PSUs and RSUs awarded contain terms where employees become immediately vested in PSUs and RSUs upon retirement. As a result, compensation
expense for employees that are retirement eligible at the grant date is recognized immediately, while compensation expense for employees that become retirement
eligible during the vesting period is recognized over the period from grant date to the date of retirement eligibility. In addition, the Registrants recognize forfeitures as
they occur.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All unvested PSUs and RSUs vest immediately upon a change in control where Southern Company is not the surviving corporation.
Performance Share Units
PSUs granted to employees vest at the end of a three-year performance period. Shares of Southern Company common stock are delivered to employees at the end of the
performance period with the number of shares issued ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted, based on achievement of the performance goals
established by the Compensation Committee of the Southern Company Board of Directors.
Southern Company has issued three types of PSUs, each with a unique performance goal. These types of PSUs include total shareholder return (TSR) awards based on
the TSR for Southern Company common stock during the three-year performance period as compared to a group of industry peers; ROE awards based on Southern
Company's equity-weighted return over the performance period; and EPS awards based on Southern Company's cumulative EPS over the performance period. EPS
awards were last granted in 2017.
The fair value of TSR awards is determined as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In determining the fair value of the TSR awards issued to
employees, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Southern Company's stock over a period equal to the performance period. The risk-free rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the performance period of the awards. The following table shows the assumptions used in
the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date fair value of TSR awards granted:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Year Ended December 31</td>
   <td>2022</td>
   <td>2021</td>
   <td>2020</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Expected volatility</td>
   <td>29.6%</td>
   <td>30.0%</td>
   <td>15.4%</td>

   <td>Weighted average grant-date fair value</td>
   <td>$79.69</td>
   <td>$69.06</td>
   <td>$77.65</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Registrants recognize TSR award compensation expense on a straight-line basis over thethree-year performance period without remeasurement.
The fair values of EPS awards and ROE awards are based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The weighted average
grant-date fair value of the ROE awards granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $66.87, $59.49, and $68.42, respectively. Compensation expense for EPS and ROE
awards is generally recognized ratably over the three-year performance period adjusted for expected changes in EPS and ROE performance. Total compensation cost
recognized for vested EPS awards and ROE awards reflects final performance metrics.
Southern Company had 2.2 million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021. In February 2022, the PSUs that vested for thethree-year performance period
ended December 31, 2021 were converted into 2.5 million shares outstanding at a share price of $66.57. During 2022, Southern Company granted 1.3 million PSUs and
1.1 million PSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in2.4 million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022. In February 2023, the PSUs that vested for the
three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022 were converted into1.8 million shares outstanding at a weighted average share price of $67.13.
Total PSU compensation cost, and the related tax benefit recognized in income, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:

Registrant is recognized in each Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity representing a capital contribution from Southern
Company.
At December 31, 2022, Southern Company's total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $$1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of approximately 19 months. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs at December 31, 2022 was immaterial for all other Registrants.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The weighted average grant-date fair values of
RSUs granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $67.20, $59.56, and $67.60, respectively. For most RSU awards, one-third of the RSUs vest each year throughout a
three-year service period and compensation cost for RSUs is generally recognized over the correspondingone-, two-, or three-year vesting period. Shares of Southern
Company common stock are delivered to employees at the end of each vesting period.
Southern Company had 1.1 million RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021. During 2022, Southern Company granted0.4 million RSUs and 0.6 million RSUs were
vested or forfeited, resulting in 0.9 million unvested RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022, including RSUs related to employee retention agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Southern Company's total compensation cost for RSUs recognized in income was $6 million, $32 million, and
$29 million, respectively. The related tax benefit also recognized in income was $7 million, $8 million, and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs at December 31, 2022, which is being recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 18 months, is immaterial for Southern Company.
Total RSUs outstanding and total compensation cost and related tax benefit for the RSUs recognized in income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,
as well as the total unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2022, were immaterial for all other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of
Southern Company RSUs to the employees of each Subsidiary Registrant is recognized in such Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit
to equity representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.
Stock Options
In 2015, Southern Company discontinued granting stock options. As of December 31, 2017, all stock option awards were vested and compensation cost fully recognized.
Stock options expire no later than 10 years after the grant date and the latest possible exercise will occur by November 2024. At December 31, 2022, the weighted
average remaining contractual term for the options outstanding and exercisable was approximately 10 months.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

* Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
* Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is either directly or indirectly observable.
* Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of each Registrant of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If there is little available market data, then each Registrant's own assumptions are the best available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

Net asset value as a practical expedient is the classification used for assets that do not have readily determined fair values. Fund managers value the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the underlying investments.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power products, including, from
time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from
observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also
standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate
derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates.
Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options.
The fair value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of
future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and discount rates.
The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and
valuations of similar instruments. See Note 14 for additional information on how these derivatives are used.
For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred compensation trusts, external pricing vendors
are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is
determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary
pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general
approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed
market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live
trading levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.
The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. See
Note 6 under "Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information.
Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make generation-based payments to the seller,
which commenced at the commercial operation of the respective facility and continue through 2026. The obligations are categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value
Measurements as the fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs for the forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a
fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected payments and any periodic
change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.
Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection facilities and network upgrades
constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating facility to the transmission system. The obligations are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value
Measurements as the fair value is determined using observable inputs for the contracted amounts and reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of
the obligations reflects the net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" include investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value
Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds, and/or agency bonds.
The fair value measurements of private equity investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are calculated at net asset value per share (or
its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $161 million and $150 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unfunded commitments related to the
private equity investments totaled $78 million and $69 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Private equity investments include high-quality private
equity funds across several market sectors and funds that invest in real estate assets. Private equity funds do not have redemption rights. Distributions from these funds
will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

(*) The long-term debt of Southern Company Gas is recorded at amortized cost, including the fair value adjustments at the effective date of the 2016 merger with Southern Company. Southern Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.

The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Registrants.

**14. DERIVATIVES**

The Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations used various contracts in its commercial activities that generally met the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note 13 for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 under "Financial Instruments" for additional information. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.

**Energy-Related Derivatives**

The Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.

Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in operating revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
*   Regulatory Hedges - Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and the
    natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are
    included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
*   Cash Flow Hedges - Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales)
    are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings
    effect of the hedged transactions.
*   Not Designated - Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of
    income as incurred.

Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within
the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract
price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

At December 31, 2022, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective
entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges,
were as follows:

<sup>(*)</sup> Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a contract to sell natural
gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of 98 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2022, which is also
included in Southern Company's total volume. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.

In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply contracts that provide
the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is 23 million mmBtu for
Southern Company, which includes 6 million mmBtu for Alabama Power, 8 million mmBtu for Georgia Power, 3 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 6 million
mmBtu for Southern Power.

For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings for the year ending
December 31, 2023 are $(27) million for Southern Company, $(11) million for Southern Power, and $(16) million for Southern Company Gas.

**Interest Rate Derivatives**

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives related to existing variable
rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified
into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing
fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded
directly to earnings on the same income statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in
the statements of income as incurred.

expected to be amortized into earnings through 2052 for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power, 2028 for Mississippi Power, and 2046 for Southern
Company Gas.

Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are
accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same
income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange
rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair
value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the
U.S. currency exchange rates. Southern Company has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in the fair value hedges of
its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings as a
component of OCI.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
The Registrants enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and payables for routine
billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master netting agreements to mitigate exposure to
counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting across product lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of

(a) Reclassified from AOCI into earnings.
(b) For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are generally equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no material impact on income.
(c) The reclassification from AOCI into other income (expense), net completely offsets currency gains and losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates used to record the euro-
denominated notes.
The pre-tax effects of cash flow and fair value hedge accounting on income for interest rate derivatives and energy-related derivatives were immaterial for the traditional
electric operating companies for all years presented.

(*) Excludes the impact of weather derivatives recorded in natural gas revenues of $(7) million and $9 million for 2022 and 2020, respectively, as they are accounted for based on intrinsic value
rather than fair value. There was no weather derivatives impact for 2021.

The pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all other Registrants for all years presented.

**Contingent Features**

The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.
There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company
subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2022, the Registrants had no collateral
posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.

For Southern Company and Southern Power, the fair value of interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral
requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were $78 million and $23 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2022. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum
potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2022.
The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to
below investment grade.

Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions and they may be
required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2022, cash collateral posted in
these accounts was $15 million for Southern Power and immaterial for Alabama Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses
of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern
Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2022, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $41 million.

The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants only enter into agreements and
material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover
potential credit exposure. The Registrants have also

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty
credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other
credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade
financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its
counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited
financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company
Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such
provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing
receivables and energy marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.
15. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
None of the dispositions discussed herein, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for the applicable Registrants that has, or is expected
to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the assets related to the sales have been classified as discontinued operations for any of
the periods presented.
Southern Company
In connection with the annual impairment analysis of a leveraged lease investment during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern Company management concluded that the
estimated residual value of the generation assets should be reduced due to significant uncertainty as to whether the related natural gas generation assets would continue to
operate at the end of the lease term in 2040 and recorded a $34 million ($17 million after tax) impairment charge. Also during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern
Company management initiated steps to sell the investment and reclassified it as held for sale. In the fourth quarter 2020 and the second quarter 2021, additional charges
of $18 million ($14 million after tax) and $7 million ($6 million after tax), respectively, were recorded to further reduce the investment to its estimated fair value, less
costs to sell. In October 2021, Southern Company completed the sale to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale; however, it did result in the
recognition of approximately $16 million of additional tax benefits.
In December 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with itstwo international leveraged lease projects and
received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was
approximately $93 million ($99 million gain after tax).
Alabama Power
In 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, an approximately885-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga
County, Alabama. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The total purchase price was $461 million, of which $452 million was related to net
assets recorded within property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet and reflected in property additions within the investing section of the statement of cash flows.
The remainder primarily related to inventory, current receivables, and accounts payable. Alabama Power assumed an existing power sales agreement under which the full
output of the generating facility remains committed to another third party through May 2023. During the remaining term, the revenues from the power sales agreement
are expected to substantially offset the associated costs of operation. See Note 9 under "Lessor" for additional information.
On September 30, 2022, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The total purchase
price was $179 million, of which $171 million was related to net assets recorded within property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet and reflected in property
additions within the investing section of the statement of cash flows. The remainder primarily related to fossil fuel stock and materials and supplies.
See Note 2 under "Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.
