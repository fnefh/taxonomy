FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
--------------------------

This report contains forward-looking statements that are intended to qualify for the safe-harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations and not facts. Words such as "forecasts," "expects," "estimates," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "plans," "will," "target," "guidance," "potential," "goal," "consider" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements reflect information available and assumptions at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements because of various factors such as those identified in reports the Companies have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to:

* · the Companies are extensively regulated and are subject to substantial penalties;
* · the Utilities' rate plans may not provide a reasonable return;
* · the Companies may be adversely affected by changes to the Utilities' rate plans;
* · the failure of, or damage to, the Companies' facilities could adversely affect the Companies;
* · a cyber attack could adversely affect the Companies;
* · the failure of processes and systems, the failure to retain and attract employees and contractors, and their negative performance could adversely affect the Companies;
* · the Companies are exposed to risks from the environmental consequences of their operations, including increased costs related to climate change;
* · Con Edison's ability to pay dividends or interest depends on dividends from its subsidiaries;
* · changes to tax laws could adversely affect the Companies;
* · the Companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements;
* · a disruption in the wholesale energy markets, increased commodity costs or failure by an energy supplier or customer could adversely affect the Companies;
* · the Companies face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks;
* · the Companies' strategies may not be effective to address changes in the external business environment;
* · the Companies face risks related to supply chain disruptions and inflation; and
* · the Companies also face other risks that are beyond their control.

This list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ from the forward-looking statements. The Companies assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
---------------------------------------------

General
-------

These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the separate interim consolidated financial statements of each of the two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (CECONY). CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, that are presented separately in the CECONY consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Con Edison Transmission) and its former subsidiary, Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Clean Energy Businesses), in Con Edison's consolidated financial statements. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S. The term "Utilities" is used in these notes to refer to CECONY and O&R.

As used in these notes, the term "Companies" refers to Con Edison and CECONY and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, CECONY makes no representation as to information contained in these combined notes relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.

The separate interim consolidated financial statements of each of the Companies are unaudited but, in the opinion of their respective managements, reflect all adjustments (which include only normally recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The Companies' separate interim consolidated financial statements should be read together with their separate audited financial statements (including the combined notes thereto) included in Item 8 of their combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and their separate unaudited financial statements (including the combined notes thereto) included in Part 1, Item 1 of their combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

Con Edison has two regulated utility subsidiaries: CECONY and O&R. CECONY provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County and steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiary, provides electric service in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, and gas service in southeastern New York. Con Edison Transmission invests in and seeks to develop electric transmission projects through its subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Transmission, LLC, and manages, through joint ventures, investments in gas pipeline and storage facilities through its subsidiary, Con Edison Gas Pipeline and Storage, LLC. See "Investments" in Note A.

Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Matters

Accounting Policies
-------------------

The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state regulators having jurisdiction.

Investments
-----------

Con Edison's investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method and the fair value of the Utilities' supplemental retirement income plan and deferred income plan assets.

Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP)
-------------------------------------------------

In June 2024, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile gas transmission pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia, entered service. The project operator is continuing restoration of the right of way and estimates a total project cost of approximately $8,100 million (excluding allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC)). Con Edison Transmission's interest in MVP, the company that developed the project, is expected to be approximately 6.6 percent. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of Con Edison Transmission's investment in MVP was $165 million, and its cash contributions to the joint venture amounted to $530 million. Con Edison records its pro rata share of earnings from its equity investment in MVP, adjusted for accretion of the basis difference and income taxes, on its consolidated income statement. Con Edison's pro rata share of earnings from its equity investment in MVP, adjusted for accretion of the basis difference, was $8 million ($6 million after-tax) and $21 million ($15 million after-tax) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Reclassification
----------------

20

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

Earnings Per Share
------------------

Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders ("Net income for common stock" on Con Edison's consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.

Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock units and deferred stock units for which the average market price of the common shares for the period was greater than the estimated vesting price.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows:

| | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Net income for common stock | $588 | $526 | $1,510 | $2,185 |
| Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic | 346.2 | 345.0 | 345.9 | 348.4 |
| Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities | 1.3 | 1.5 | 1.3 | 1.5 |
| Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted | 347.5 | 346.5 | 347.2 | 349.9 |
| Net Income per common share - basic | $1.70 | $1.53 | $4.37 | $6.27 |
| Net Income per common share - diluted | $1.69 | $1.52 | $4.35 | $6.24 |

Reconciliation of Cash, Temporary Cash Investments and Restricted Cash
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash are presented on a combined basis in the Companies' consolidated statements of cash flows. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash for Con Edison were as follows; CECONY did not have material restricted cash balances as of September 30, 2024 and 2023:

| | At September 30, Con Edison | At September 30, Con Edison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 |
| Cash and temporary cash investments | $93 | $539 |
| Restricted cash (a) | 9 | 6 |
| Total cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash | $102 | $545 |

Variable Interest Entities
--------------------------

The accounting rules for consolidation address the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have a sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and either absorbs a significant amount of the VIE's losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.

The Companies enter into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, the Companies retain or may retain a variable interest in these entities.

CECONY has an ongoing long-term electricity purchase agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP, a potential VIE. In 2023, a request was made of this counterparty for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether CECONY is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. The payments for this contract constitute CECONY's maximum exposure to loss with respect to the potential VIE.

Assets Held for Sale
--------------------

Generally, a long-lived asset or business to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. During the first nine months of 2022, Con Edison considered strategic alternatives with respect to the Clean Energy Businesses.

As described further in Note R, on October 1, 2022, Con Edison's management received authority to commit to a plan to sell the Clean Energy Businesses and entered into a purchase and sale agreement. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses with the exception of two tax equity interests in three projects and one deferred project, Broken Bow II. Broken Bow II continued to be classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. See Note S.

Note B - Regulatory Matters
---------------------------

Rate Plans
----------

O&R New York - Electric
-----------------------

In April 2024, O&R filed an update to its January 2024 request to the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) for an electric rate increase effective January 1, 2025. The company decreased its requested January 2024 rate increase by $7.5 million to $10.7 million. For pu rposes of illustration, the filing calculated rate increases of $34.8 million and $55 million effective January 2026 and 2027, respectively, based upon the proposed return on common equity of 10.25 percent and a common equity ratio of 50 percent. In May 2024, the New York State Department of Public Service (NYSDPS) submitted testimony in the NYSPSC proceeding in which O&R requested an electric rate increase, effective January 1, 2025. The NYSDPS testimony supports an electric rate decrease of $27.6 million, reflecting, among other things, a 9.50 percent return on common equity and a common equity ratio of 48 percent.

O&R New York - Gas
------------------

In April 2024, O&R filed an update to its January 2024 request to the NYSPSC for a gas rate increase effective January 1, 2025. The c ompany increased its requested January 2024 rate increase by $3.1 million to $17.5 million. Fo r purposes of illustration, the filing calculated rate increases of $ 22.8 million and $19.2 million effective January 2026 and 2027, respectively, based upon the proposed return on common equity of 10.25 percent and a common equity ratio of 50 percent. In May 2024, the NYSDPS submitted testimony in the NYSPSC proceeding in which O&R requested a gas rate increase, effective January 1, 2025. The NYSDPS testimony supports a gas rate decrease of $2.9 million, reflecting, among other things, a 9.50 percent return on common equity and a common equity ratio of 48 percent.

Bill Relief Program
-------------------

In March 2024, CECONY and O&R received $ 91 million and $9 million, respectively, pursuant to a New York State bill relief program funded by the state that provided a one-time bill credit for electric and gas customers. The program was established to partially offset the costs all customers pay to fund utility energy affordability programs.

Other Regulatory Matters
------------------------

In January 2023, CECONY initiated a review of welds on certain gas and steam mains following the company's discovery of a leak from a gas main weld in Queens, New York. During the course of its review thus far, CECONY discovered a limited number of other non-conforming gas and steam main welds. New York regulations require utilities to perform and record weld films for certain gas and steam main welds. Upon reviewing these films, CECONY determined that in some instances third-party contractors engaged in misconduct by substituting duplicate weld films for different welds, while another third-party contractor had created poor quality weld films. CECONY voluntarily disclosed its initial review and findings to the NYSDPS which, in turn, initiated its own investigation. CECONY also reported the contractors' misconduct to law enforcement. Given the nature of the non-conforming welds identified, CECONY does not anticipate significant impact to the operation of its gas and steam mains. CECONY continues to investigate this matter, is remediating and monitoring the known non-conforming welds and is cooperating with the NYSDPS on its investigation of this matter. CECONY is unable to estimate the amount or

range of its possible loss, if any, related to this matter. At September 30, 2024, CECONY had not accrued a liability related to this matter.

In May 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order denying an April 2023 petition by CECONY that requested permission to capitalize costs to implement its new customer billing and information system to the extent those costs exceeded the $421 million cap established in CECONY's 2020 - 2022 electric and gas rate plans. CECONY's final costs for the new system were $510 million ($89 million above the $421 million cap in the rate plans). CECONY believes that the incremental costs were both prudent and necessary for the successful deployment of the system for the benefit of its customers. In May 2024, CECONY expensed incremental costs of $51 million for the new system that were previously capitalized, in addition to a $ 38 million reserve established at December 31, 2023. In June 2024, CECONY filed a petition for rehearing with the NYSPSC. CECONY is unable to predict the NYSPSC's response to its rehearing petition.

In January 2018, the NYSPSC issued an order initiating a focused operations audit of the Utilities' financial accounting for income taxes. The audit is investigating the Utilities' inadvertent understatement of a portion, the amount of which may be material, of their calculation of total federal income tax expense for ratemaking purposes related to the calculation of plant retirement-related cost of removal. As a result of such understatement, the Utilities accumulated significant income tax regulatory assets ($1,066 million and $14 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and $1,113 million and $18 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively, as of December 31, 2023) which are not earning a return. While the Utilities have properly calculated and paid their federal income taxes and there is no uncertain tax position related to this matter, this understatement of historical income tax expense materially reduced the amount of revenue collected from the Utilities' customers in the past relative to what it should have been. The Utilities' rate plans have reflected the correct amount of federal income taxes recoverable from customers, including a proportionate recovery of the regulatory asset, beginning with O&R's rate plans effective November 2015, CECONY's electric and gas rate plans effective January 2017, and CECONY's steam plan effective November 2023. As part of the audit, the Utilities plan to pursue a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming that the Utilities' inadvertent understatement of prior years' income tax expense constitutes a normalization violation that can be cured through an increase in future years' revenue requirements until such time as the regulatory asset is fully recovered in rates, and not through a write-down of all or a portion of the Utilities' regulatory asset. Under Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740, the Utilities recorded an unfunded deferred federal income tax liability (with a gross-up amount) and a corresponding regulatory asset. The income tax regulatory assets are netted against the related regulatory liability for future income tax and are shown in the line "Future income tax" in the following table of Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and on the Companies' consolidated balance sheets in the line "Regulatory liabilities." Management's assessment is that the income tax regulatory assets as of September 30, 2024 are probable of collection through future rates. The IRS provides safe harbor relief for inadvertent normalization violations through the jurisdictional rate setting process of including in rates adequate revenue to fully recover the deferred tax balance. However, the Utilities would record a liability or impair a portion of the regulatory assets associated with this understatement if the NYSPSC were to issue an order that required the Utilities to write off all or a portion of their existing regulatory asset. The Utilities are unable to estimate the amount or range of their possible loss, if any, related to this matter. At September 30, 2024, the Utilities had not accrued a liability related to this matter.

In general, the Utilities receive or are being credited with a return at the Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for regulatory assets that have not been included in rate base, and receive or are being credited with a return at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital once the asset is included in rate base. Similarly, the Utilities pay to or credit customers with a return at the Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for regulatory liabilities that have not been included in rate base, and pay to or credit customers with a return at the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital once the liability is included in rate base. The Other Customer-Provided Capital rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 was 5.95 percent and 5.20 percent, respectively.

In general, the Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made ($ 3,095 million and $2,541 million for Con Edison, and $2,873 million and $2,359 million for CECONY at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively). Regulatory assets of RECO for which a cash outflow has been made ($24 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023) are not receiving or being credited with a return. RECO recovers regulatory assets over a period of up to four years or until they are addressed in its next base rate case in accordance with the rate provisions approved by the NJBPU. Regulatory liabilities are treated in a consistent manner.

Regulatory assets that represent future financial obligations and were deferred in accordance with the Utilities' rate plans or orders issued by state regulators do not earn a return until such time as a cash outlay has been made. Regulatory liabilities are treated in a consistent manner. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY that did not earn a return consisted of the following items:

Regulatory Assets Not Earning a Return\*
----------------------------------------

| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Environmental remediation costs | $1,093 | $1,105 | $1,009 | $1,022 |
| Revenue taxes | 558 | 490 | 535 | 470 |
| COVID-19 deferral for uncollectible accounts receivable | 391 | 291 | 384 | 288 |
| Deferred derivative losses - current | 165 | 269 | 152 | 253 |
| Deferred derivative losses - long term | 154 | 163 | 138 | 148 |
| Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs | 10 | - | 10 | - |
| Other | 75 | 29 | 63 | 28 |
| Total | $2,446 | $2,347 | $2,291 | $2,209 |

The recovery periods for regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has not been made and that do not earn a return have not yet been determined, except as noted below, and are expected to be determined pursuant to the Utilities' future rate plans to be filed or orders issued by the state regulators in connection therewith.

The Utilities recover unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs over 10 years, and the portion of investment gains or losses are recognized in expense over 15 years, pursuant to NYSPSC policy.

The deferral for revenue taxes represents the New York State metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge on the cumulative temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities of the Utilities, as well as the difference between taxes collected and paid by the Utilities to fund mass transportation. The Utilities recover the majority of the revenue taxes over the remaining book lives of the electric and gas plant assets, as well as the steam plant assets for CECONY.

The Utilities recover deferred derivative losses - current within one year, and noncurrent generally within three years.

Note C - Capitalization
-----------------------

In May 2024, CECONY issued $ 400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375 percent debentures, due 2034 and $ 1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5.7 percent debentures, due 2054.

In September 2024, O&R issued $ 125 million aggregate principal amount of 5.41 percent debentures, due 2054.

In October 2024, all of the $ 224.6 million of Series 2010A tax-exempt bonds issued for the benefit of CECONY, bearing interest at a weekly rate, were called for redemption in November 2024.

The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were:

25

| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Long-Term Debt (including current portion) (a) | Carrying Amount | Fair Value | Carrying Amount | Fair Value |
| Con Edison (b) | $23,688 | $22,535 | $22,177 | $20,525 |
| CECONY | $22,446 | $21,371 | $21,060 | $19,517 |

The fair values of the Companies' long-term debt have been estimated primarily using available market information and at September 30, 2024 are classified as Level 2 liabilities. See Note O.

Note D - Short-Term Borrowing
-----------------------------

In March 2024, CECONY entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) that replaced a March 2023 CECONY 364-Day Credit Agreement under which banks are committed to provide loans up to $ 500 million on a revolving credit basis. The CECONY Credit Agreement expires in March 2025 and supports CECONY's commercial paper program. Loans issued under the CECONY Credit Agreement may also be used for other general corporate purposes. Any borrowings under the CECONY Credit Agreement would generally be at variable interest rates.

The banks' commitments under the CECONY Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default under the CECONY Credit Agreement. The commitments are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by CECONY under the CECONY Credit Agreement, the banks may terminate their commitments and declare any amounts owed by CECONY immediately due and payable. Events of default include, among others, CECONY exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of 0.65 to 1; CECONY having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding 10 percent of its consolidated net tangible assets, subject to certain exceptions; CECONY or any of its material subsidiaries failing to make one or more payments in respect of material financial obligations (in excess of an aggregate $150 million of debt or derivative obligations other than non-recourse debt); the occurrence of an event or condition which results in the acceleration of the maturity of any material debt (in excess of an aggregate $ 150 million of debt other than non-recourse debt) or enables the holders of such debt to accelerate the maturity thereof; and other customary events of default. Interest and fees charged reflect CECONY's credit rating.

At September 30, 2024, Con Edison had $ 2,059 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $1,676 million was outstanding under CECONY's program. The weighted average interest rate at September 30, 2024 was 5.1 percent for both Con Edison and CECONY. At December 31, 2023, Con Edison had $2,288 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $1,903 million was outstanding under CECONY's program. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2023 was 5.6 percent for both Con Edison and CECONY.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the Companies' $ 2,500 million 2023 Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) and no loans were outstanding under the CECONY Credit Agreement. The Companies were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at September 30, 2024. In March 2024, the termination date of the Credit Agreement was extended from March 2028 to March 2029. In March 2024, the Companies also entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement that, among other things, amended the mechanics relating to determining the interest rate to be paid with respect to a "term SOFR loan."

Components of net periodic benefit credit other than service cost are presented outside of operating income on the Companies' consolidated income statements, and only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization. Accordingly, the service cost component is included in the line "Other operations and maintenance" and the non-service cost components are included in the lines "Other income" and "Other deductions" in the Companies' consolidated income statements.

Expected Contributions
----------------------

Based on esti mates as of September 30, 2024, the Companies expect to make contributions to the pension plans during 2024 of $ 25 million (of which $22 million is to be made by CECONY). The Companies' policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost of the qualified plan to the extent tax deductible and to also contribute to the non-qualified supplemental pension plans. No funding is anticipated for the qualified plan during 2024, and during the first nine months of 2024, the Companies contributed $15 million to the non-qualified supplemental pension plans, $ 13 million of which was contributed by CECONY. CECONY also contributed $12 million to the external trust for its non-qualified supplemental pension plan.

Contributions
-------------

As of September 30, 2024, the Companies contributed $ 7 million (all of which was made by CECONY) to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2024. The Companies' policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost of the plans to the extent tax deductible.

Note G - Environmental Matters
------------------------------

Superfund Sites
---------------

Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which include costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and natural resource damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated, are referred to herein as "Superfund Sites."

For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay

to investigate and, where determinable, discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the company's share of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites, if remediation is necessary and if a reasonable estimate of such cost can be made. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.

The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Accrued Liabilities: | | | | |
| Manufactured gas plant sites | $996 | $1,016 | $904 | $924 |
| Other Superfund Sites | 105 | 102 | 105 | 102 |
| Total | $1,101 | $1,118 | $1,009 | $1,026 |
| Regulatory assets | $1,093 | $1,105 | $1,010 | $1,022 |

Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. However, for some of the sites, the extent and associated cost of the required remediation has not yet been determined. As investigations progress and information pertaining to the required remediation becomes available, the Utilities expect that additional liability may be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Utilities defer prudently incurred investigation and remediation costs as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates).

Environmental investigation and remediation costs incurred related to Superfund Sites for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

| | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Remediation costs incurred | $12 | $1 | $12 | $1 |

| | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Remediation costs incurred | $27 | $8 | $27 | $8 |

Insurance and other third-party recoveries received by Con Edison or CECONY were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Con Edison and CECONY estimated that for their manufactured gas plant sites (including CECONY's Astoria site), the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other environmental contaminants could range up to $3,440 million and $3,295 million, respectively. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at all sites, including those that have not yet been fully investigated and additional assumptions about the extent of the contamination and the type and extent of the remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.

Asbestos Proceedings
--------------------

Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, that are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. At September 30, 2024, Con Edison and CECONY have accrued their estimated aggregate undiscounted potential liabilities for these suits and additional suits that may be brought through 2035 as shown in the following table. These estimates were based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Courts have applied, and may continue to apply, different standards for determining liability in asbestos suits than the standard that applied historically. As a result, the Companies currently believe that there is a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the suits. The Companies are unable to estimate the amount or range of such loss. In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers' compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. CECONY is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) costs incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers' compensation claims.

The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers' compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities for the Companies at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Accrued liability - asbestos suits | $8 | $8 | $7 | $7 |
| Regulatory assets - asbestos suits | $8 | $8 | $7 | $7 |
| Accrued liability - workers' compensation | $55 | $56 | $53 | $54 |
| Regulatory liabilities - workers' compensation | $18 | $17 | $18 | $17 |

Manhattan Explosion and Fire
----------------------------

On March 12, 2014, two multi-use five-story tall buildings located on Park Avenue between 116 and 117 Streets in Manhattan were destroyed by an explosion and fire. CECONY had delivered gas to the buildings through service lines from a distribution main located below ground on Park Avenue. Eight people died and more than 50 people were injured. Additional buildings were also damaged. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The parties to the investigation included CECONY, the City of New York, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the NYSPSC. In June 2015, the NTSB issued a final report concerning the incident, its probable cause and safety recommendations. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the incident was (1) the failure of a defective fusion joint at a service tee (which joined a plastic service line to a plastic distribution main) installed by CECONY that allowed gas to leak from the distribution main and migrate into a building where it ignited and (2) a breach in a city sewer line that allowed groundwater and soil to flow into the sewer, resulting in a loss of support for the distribution main, that caused it to sag and overstressed the defective fusion joint. The NTSB also made safety recommendations, including recommendations to CECONY that addressed its procedures for the preparation and examination of plastic fusions, training of its staff on conditions for notifications to the city's Fire Department and extension of its gas main isolation valve installation program. In February 2017, the NYSPSC approved a settlement agreement with CECONY related to the NYSPSC's investigations of the incident and the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions. Pursuant to the agreement, CECONY provided $27 million of future benefits to customers (for which it accrued a regulatory liability) and did not recover from customers $ 126 million of costs for gas emergency response activities that it had previously incurred and expensed. Lawsuits are pending against CECONY seeking generally unspecified damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and business interruption. CECONY notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover CECONY's costs, in excess of a required retention (the amount of which is not material), to satisfy any liability it may have for damages in connection with the incident. During 2020, CECONY accrued its estimated liability for the suits of $40 million and an insurance receivable in the same amount, and such estimated liability and receivable did not change as of September 30, 2024. th th

For additional contingencies, see "Other Regulatory Matters" in Note B, Note G and "Uncertain Tax Positions" in Note J.

Guarantees
----------

Con Edison and its subsidiaries have entered into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, Con Edison provided guarantees to third parties on behalf of the Clean Energy Businesses, all of which were transferred to the buyer of the Clean Energy Businesses, RWE Aktiengesellschaft (RWE). Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison and its subsidiaries under these agreements totaled $175 million at December 31, 2023, and there were no guarantees related to the Clean Energy Businesses at September 30, 2024.

A summary, by type and term, of Con Edison's total guarantees under these agreements at September 30, 2024 is as follows:

| Guarantee Type | 0 - 3 years | > 10 years | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (Millions of Dollars) | (Millions of Dollars) | |
| Con Edison Transmission | $54 | $- | $54 |
| Broken Bow II | - | 9 | 9 |
| Total | $54 | $9 | $63 |

Con Edison Transmission Con Edison has guaranteed payment by Con Edison Transmission of the contributions Con Edison Transmission agreed to make to New York Transco LLC (New York Transco). Con Edison Transmission owns a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco's New York Energy Solution project, the majority of which has been completed. Guarantee amount shown includes the maximum possible required amount of Con Edison Transmission's contributions for the remainder of this project as calculated based on the assumptions that the project is completed at 175 percent of its estimated remaining costs and New York Transco does not use any debt financing for the project.

Broken Bow II Con Edison has guaranteed obligations on behalf of Broken Bow II associated with its investment in a wind energy facility. Broken Bow II is held for sale as of September 30, 2024. See Note S.

Note I - Leases
---------------

Operating lease cost and cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

| | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Operating lease cost | $17 | $17 | $17 | $17 |
| Operating lease cash flows | $6 | $6 | $6 | $6 |

| | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023(a) | 2024 | 2023 |
| Operating lease cost | $50 | $53 | $49 | $49 |
| Operating lease cash flows | $15 | $17 | $14 | $14 |

At September 30, 2024, CECONY had two operating lease agreements for battery storage facilities that had not yet commenced operation. Both leases have a lease term of 15 years, and are expected to commence operation within two and three years, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations for Con Edison and CECONY, nor any material lease terminations.

Note J - Income Tax
-------------------

Con Edison's income tax expense was $ 133 million and $144 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to non-recurring state income taxes in 2023 from the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses.

CECONY's income tax expense was $119 million and $109 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher income before income tax expense.

Reconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes for the t hree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

| | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Three Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |
| (% of Pre-tax income) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| STATUTORY TAX RATE | | | | |
| Federal | 21 % | 21 % | 21 % | 21 % |
| Changes in computed taxes resulting from: | | | | |
| State income tax, net of federal income taxes | 5 | 8 | 5 | 5 |
| Amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes | (7) | (6) | (7) | (7) |
| Cost of removal | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Allowance for uncollectible accounts, net of COVID-19 assistance | (1) | (2) | (1) | (2) |
| Changes in state apportionments, net of federal income taxes | - | 1 | - | - |
| Other | - | (2) | (1) | (1) |
| Effective tax rate | 19 % | 21 % | 18 % | 17 % |

Con Edison's income tax expense was $ 307 million and $416 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to lower income before income tax expense, offset in part by the absence of a tax benefit from the recognition of deferred unamortized investment tax credits, both related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023.

CECONY's income tax expense was $301 million and $297 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher income before income tax expense, offset in part by higher amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes.

Reconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

| | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Con Edison | Con Edison | CECONY | CECONY |

| Effective tax rate | 17 % | 16 % | 18 % | 19 % |

In April 2023, the IRS released Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized as improvements by the taxpayer or deducted for federal income tax purposes in the current tax year. This revenue procedure also provides procedures for taxpayers to obtain automatic consent to change their method of accounting to the safe harbor method of accounting. Con Edison adopted the safe harbor rules on its 2023 federal and state returns and recorded a reduction in its current tax payable and an increase in accumulated deferred tax liabilities of $457 million, $418 million of which is for CECONY and $ 39 million of which is for O&R, to reflect the cumulative impact of this change in accounting method for the Utilities.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax
---------------------------------

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Pursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT.

Beginning in 2024, based on the existing statute, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of $73 million, $64 million of which is for CECONY, before the application of general business credits, with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The deferred tax asset related to the minimum tax credit carryforward will be realized to the extent the Companies' consolidated deferred tax liabilities exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward. The Companies' deferred tax liabilities are expected to exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward for the foreseeable future and thus no valuation allowance is required. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.

Uncertain Tax Positions
-----------------------

At September 30, 2024, the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions for Con Edison was $ 13 million, $9 million of which is for CECONY). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Con Edison recognized $2 million, all of which is for CECONY, of income tax expense related to current year positions. Con Edison reasonably expects to resolve within the next twelve months approximately $3 million (the entire amount attributable to CECONY) of various federal uncertainties due to the expected completion of ongoing tax examinations, of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce their effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would reduce Con Edison's effective tax rate is $13 million ($12 million, net of federal income taxes) with $ 9 million attributable to CECONY.

The Companies recognize interest on liabilities for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and would recognize penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies' consolidated income statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense and no penalties for uncertain tax positions in their consolidated income statements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of accrued interest on their consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2024, New York State completed its examination of the Companies' New York State income and franchise tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2021 with no changes. The Companies' return for tax year 2022 remains open under the statute of limitations.

Note K - Revenue Recognition

Use of the Percentage-of-Completion Method
------------------------------------------

Sales and profits on each percentage-of-completion contract at the Clean Energy Businesses were recorded each month based on the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative revenues recognized in prior periods (the ''cost-to-cost'' method). The impact of revisions of contract estimates, which may have resulted from contract modifications, performance or other reasons, were recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions were made . On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R.

Note L - Current Expected Credit Losses
---------------------------------------

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
------------------------------------

The Utilities' "Account receivable - customers" balance consists of utility bills due (bills are generally due the month following billing) from customers who have energy delivered, generated, or services provided by the Utilities. The balance also reflects the Utilities' purchase of receivables from energy service companies to support the retail choice programs.

The "Other receivables" balance generally reflects costs billed by the Utilities for goods and services provided to external parties, such as accommodation work for private parties and certain governmental entities, real estate rental and pole attachments.

The Companies develop expected loss estimates using past events data and consider current conditions and future reasonable and supportable forecasts. Changes to the Utilities' reserve balances that result in write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances above existing rate allowances are not reflected in rates during the term of the current rate plans. For the Utilities' customer accounts receivable allowance for uncollectible accounts, past events considered include write-offs relative to customer accounts receivable; current conditions include macro-and micro-economic conditions related to trends in the local economy, bankruptcy rates and aged customer accounts receivable balances, among other factors; and forecasts about the future include assumptions related to the level of write-offs and recoveries. Generally, the Utilities write off customer accounts receivable as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment, or the account is closed during the collection process.

Other receivables allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on a historical average of collections relative to total other receivables, including current receivables. Current macro- and micro-economic conditions are also considered when calculating the current reserve. Probable outcomes of pending litigation, whether favorable or unfavorable to the Companies, are also included in the consideration.

Starting in 2020, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was also considered in forward-looking projections rela ted to write-off and recovery rates and resulted in increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The increases to the allowance for customer uncollectible accounts for Con Edison and CECONY were $27 million and $29 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $ 101 million and $95 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases (decreases) to the allowance for customer uncollectible accounts for Con Edison and CECONY were $ 1 million and $3 million , respectively, for the three months ended S eptember 30, 2023 and were $(46) million and $(45) million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulting from credits issued pursuant to New York State COVID-19 arrears assistance programs.

Customer accounts receivable and the associated allowance for uncollectible accounts are included in the line "Accounts receivable - customers" on the Companies' consolidated balance sheets. Other receivables and the associated allowance for uncollectible accounts are included in "Other receivables" on the consolidated balance sheets.

Note N - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
------------------------------------------------------

Con Edison's subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas, steam and, to a lesser extent, refined fuels by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, options, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. These are economic hedges, for which the Utilities do not elect hedge accounting. The Companies use economic hedges to manage commodity price risk in accordance with provisions set by state regulators. The volume of hedging activity at the Utilities depends upon the forecasted volume of physical commodity supply to meet customer needs, and program costs or benefits are recovered from or credited to full-service customers, respectively. Derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value (see Note O), unless an exception is available under the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging. Qualifying derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts are not reported at fair value under the accounting rules.

The fair values of the Companies' derivatives including the offsetting of assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were:

The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state utility regulators. In accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability to defer recognition of unrealized gains and losses on their electric and gas derivatives. As gains and losses are realized in future periods, they will be recognized as purchased power, gas and fuel costs in the Companies' consolidated income statements.

The following table presents the realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives that have been deferred or recognized in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The following table presents the hedged volume of Con Edison's and CECONY's commodity derivative transactions at September 30, 2024:

| | Electric Energy (MWh) (a)(b) | Capacity (MW-mos) (a) | Natural Gas (Dt) (a)(b) | Refined Fuels (gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Con Edison | 36,052,760 | 36,600 | 337,880,000 | 2,520,000 |
| CECONY | 32,953,250 | 28,200 | 316,190,000 | 2,520,000 |

The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty's nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval

process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements, collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset.

At September 30, 2024, Con Edison and CECONY h ad $6 million and $5 million, respectively, of credit exposure in connection with open energy supply net receivables and hedging activities, net of collateral. Con Edison's net credit exposure consisted of $2 million with investment-grade counterparties and $4 million with commodity exchange brokers. CECONY's net credit exposure consisted of $ 2 million with investment-grade counterparties and $3 million with commodity exchange brokers. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S.

The collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies' consolidated statements of cash flows. Most derivative instrument contracts contain provisions that may require a party to provide collateral on its derivative instruments that are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be provided will depend on the fair value of the derivative instruments and the party's credit ratings.

The following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Companies' derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position, the collateral posted for such positions and the additional collateral that would have been required to be posted had the lowest applicable credit rating been reduced one level and to below investment grade at September 30, 2024:

| (Millions of Dollars) | Con Edison (a) | CECONY (a) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggregate fair value - net liabilities | $215 | $193 |
| Collateral posted | 181 | 175 |
| Additional collateral (b) (downgrade one level from current ratings) | 12 | 3 |
| Additional collateral (b)(c) (downgrade to below investment grade from current ratings) | 166 | 136 |

Note O - Fair Value Measurements
--------------------------------

The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, that refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable firm inputs. The Companies often make certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. The Companies use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures established a fair value hierarchy, that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The rules require that assets and liabilities be classified in their entirety based on the level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Companies classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures as follows:

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

* · Level 1 - Consists of assets or liabilities whose value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes contracts traded on active exchange markets valued using unadjusted prices quoted directly from the exchange.
* · Level 2 - Consists of assets or liabilities valued using industry standard models and based on prices, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. The industry standard models consider observable assumptions including time value, volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, in addition to other economic measures. This category includes contracts traded on active exchanges or in over-the-counter markets priced with industry standard models.
* · Level 3 - Consists of assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost benefit constraints. This category includes contracts priced using models that are internally developed and contracts placed in illiquid markets. It also includes contracts that expire after the period of time for which quoted prices are available and internal models are used to determine a significant portion of the value.

For information on the measurement of Con Edison's investment in MVP that was measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, see Note A. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized below.

* December 31, 2023, the Companies determined that nonperformance risk would have no material impact on their financial position or results of operations.
* (d) Amounts represent the impact of legally-enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Companies to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.

The employees in the Companies' risk management group develop and maintain the Companies' valuation policies and procedures for, and verify pricing and fair value valuation of, commodity derivatives. Under the Companies' policies and procedures, multiple independent sources of information are obtained for forward price curves used to value commodity derivatives. Fair value and changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are reported monthly to the Companies' risk committees, comprised of officers and employees of the Companies that oversee energy hedging at the Utilities. The risk management group reports to the Companies' Vice President and Treasurer.

(a) On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S.

For the Utilities, realized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities are reported as part of purchased power, gas and fuel costs. The Utilities generally recover these costs in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utilities regulators. See Note A. Unrealized gains and losses for commodity derivatives are generally deferred on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations.

For the Clean Energy Businesses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities were repor ted in n onutility revenues ($17 million loss) on the consolidated income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and amounts for 2023 are shown through the date of sale. See Note R and Note S.

Note P - Related Party Transactions
-----------------------------------

The NYSPSC generally requires that the Utilities and Con Edison's other subsidiaries be operated as separate entities. The Utilities and the other subsidiaries are required to have separate operating employees and operating officers of the Utilities may not be operating officers of the other subsidiaries. The Utilities may provide administrative and other services to, and receive such services from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries only pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the NYSPSC. Transfers of assets between the Utilities and Con Edison or its other subsidiaries may be made only as approved by the NYSPSC. The debt of the Utilities is to be raised directly by the Utilities and not derived from Con Edison. Without the prior permission of the NYSPSC, the Utilities may not make loans to, guarantee the obligations of, or pledge assets as security for the indebtedness of Con Edison or its other subsidiaries. The NYSPSC limits the dividends that the Utilities may pay Con Edison. As a result, substantially all of the net assets of CECONY and O&R ($19,873 million and $1,134 million, respectively), at September 30, 2024, are considered restricted net assets. The NYSPSC may impose additional measures to separate, or "ring fence," the Utilities from Con Edison and its other subsidiaries.

The costs of administrative and other services provided by CECONY to, and received by it from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

| | For the Three Months Ended September 30, CECONY (a) 2024 2023 | For the Three Months Ended September 30, CECONY (a) 2024 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Millions of Dollars) | | |
| Cost of services provided | $39 | $39 |
| Cost of services received | $21 | $21 |
| | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| | CECONY (a) | |
| (Millions of Dollars) | 2024 | 2023 |
| Cost of services provided | $106 | $105 |
| Cost of services received | $62 | $61 |

(a) On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S.

In addition, CECONY and O&R have joint gas supply arrangements in connection with which CECONY sold to O&R, $ 14 million of natural gas for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and $52 million and $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, CECONY's net receivable from Con Edison for income taxes were $ 452 million and $110 million, respectively.

The Utilities perform work and incur expenses on behalf of New York Transco, a company in which Con Edison Transmission has a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco's New York Energy Solution project and a 41.7 percent interest in New York Transco's share of the Propel NY Energy project that is jointly owned with New York Power Authority (NYPA). The Utilities bill New York Transco for such work and expenses in accordance with established policies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amounts billed by the Utilities to New York Transco were immaterial.

CECONY has a 20-year transportation contract with MVP for 200,000 Dts per day of capacity. Con Edison Transmission's interest in MVP is expected to be approximately 6.6 percent. See "Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP)" in Note A. In October 2017, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resource Defense Council requested the NYSPSC to prohibit CECONY from recovering costs under its contract with MVP unless CECONY can demonstrate that the contract is in the public interest. CECONY advised the NYSPSC that it would respond to the request if the NYSPSC were to open a proceeding to consider this request. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts billed by MVP to CECONY were $12 million.

FERC has authorized CECONY to lend funds to O&R for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $ 250 million, at prevailing market rates. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no outstanding loans to O&R.

The Consolidated Edison Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation), established in December 2023, is a non-consolidated not-for-profit corporation funded by Con Ediso n that plans to make contributions t o selected charitable organizations. In April 2024, Con Edison made a $ 12 million contribution to the Foundation that Con Edison accrued as an expense in "Other Income and Deductions" within its consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Note Q - New Financial Accounting Standards
-------------------------------------------

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to the disclosure requirements for a public entity's reportable segments through ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures." The amendments improve the disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. The a mendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. A public entity should apply these amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Companies do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In December 2023, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) through ASU 2023-09 to improve disclosures related to income taxes. The amendments focus on three key areas: rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and income (or loss)/income tax expense (or benefit) from disaggregated continuing operations. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements. The Companies do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) to improve disclosures about a public business entity's expenses. The ASU addresses requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions. The amendments require a public business entity to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Companies are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the ASU on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Note R - Dispositions
---------------------

During the first nine months of 2022, Con Edison considered strategic alternatives with respect to the Clean Energy Businesses. On October 1, 2022, following the conclusion of such review and to allow for continued focus on the Utilities and their clean energy transition, Con Edison entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Con Edison agreed to sell all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses to RWE Renewables Americas, LLC, a subsidiary of RWE for a total of $6,800 million, subject to closing adjustments. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses to RWE for $3,993 million. The preliminary purchase price at closing was adjusted (i) upward for certain cash and cash equivalents, (ii) downward for certain indebtedness and debt-like items, (iii) downward for certain transaction expenses, (iv) downward to the extent that the net working capital varied from a set target, (v) upward to the extent that capital investments incurred prior to the closing of the transaction varied from a set budget, and (vi) downward by the value allocated to Broken Bow II, a project that was not able to be conveyed to RWE upon closing of the transaction. The process to finalize the purchase price was completed during the second quarter of 2024. The final purchase price was subject to customary adjustments for timing differences and a final valuation report, among other factors. The transaction was completed at arm's length and RWE was not, and will not be, considered a related party to Con Edi son.

Con Edison's preliminary gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses was $ 866 million ($784 million, after tax) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including an immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Con Edison's preliminary gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses was $865 million ($767 million, after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cumulatively through September 30, 2024 the gain on the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses was $835 million ($745 million, after tax), reflecting a downward adjustment of $30 million ($22 million after-tax) for the nine month period, resulting from certain customary closing adjustments. The portion of the gain attributable to the non-controlling interest retained in certain tax-equity projects was not material. The sale included all assets, operations and projects of the Clean Energy Businesses with the exception of tax equity interests in three projects, described below, and one deferred project, Broken Bow II, a 75MW nameplate capacity wind power project located in Nebraska. See Note S. Transfer of the project depends on one outstanding counterparty consent, and if and when such consent is obtained within two years of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses, i.e., by February 28, 2025, the project will transfer and the corresponding value, subject to adjustment, will be paid to Con Edison. RWE Renewables Americas, LLC operates the facility on behalf of Con Edison pursuant to certain service agreements, for which the fees are not material.

Con Edison retained the Clean Energy Businesses' tax equity investment interest in the Crane solar project and another tax equity investment interest in two solar projects located in Virginia. These tax equity partnerships produced renewable energy tax credits that can be used to reduce Con Edison's federal income tax. These tax credits are subject to recapture, in whole or in part, if the assets are sold within a five-year period beginning on the date on which the assets are placed in service. Con Edison will continue to employ HLBV accounting for its interests in t hese tax equity partnerships. The combined carrying value of the retained tax equity interests is approximately $9 million a t September 30, 2024.

Con Edison also retained any post-sale deferred income taxes (federal and state income taxes, including tax attributes), any valuation allowances associated with the deferred tax assets, all current federal taxes and New York State taxes and the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions. The unamortized deferred investment tax credits of the Clean Energy Businesses were recognized in full upon the completion of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses.

Concurrent with entering into the purchase and sale agreement, C on Edison incurred costs in the normal course of the sale process. Transaction costs of an immaterial amount and $11 million ($8 million after-tax), were recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Also, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $ 41 million ($28 million after-tax) were not recorded on the assets of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023 through the closing of the transaction.

Following the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses and pursuant to a reimbursement and indemnity agreement with RWE, Con Edison remains responsible for certain potential costs related to a battery storage project located in Imperial County, California. Con Edison's exposure under the agreement could range up to approximately $172 million. As of September 30, 2024, no material amounts were recorded as liabilities on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet related to this agreement.

The following table shows the pre-tax operating income for the Clean Energy Businesses. The 2023 period shown is through the date of the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses; there is no applicable data for the three and nine months ended Sept ember 30, 2024.

| (Millions of Dollars) | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2023 |

Note S - Assets and Liabilities Held-for-Sale
---------------------------------------------

On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R. The sale included all assets, operations and projects of the Clean Energy Businesses with the exception of tax equity interests in three projects and one deferred project, Broken Bow II, a 75 MW nameplate capacity wind power project located in Nebraska. Transfer of the project from Con Edison to RWE depends on one outstanding counterparty consent, and if and when such consent is obtained within two years of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses, i.e., by February 28, 2025, the project will transfer. RWE Renewables Americas, LLC operates the facility on behalf of Con Edison pursuant to certain service agreements for which the fees are not material.

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements (the Third Quarter Financial Statements) included in this report of two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY). As used in this report, the term the "Companies" refers to Con Edison and CECONY. CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about CECONY applies to Con Edison.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Third Quarter Financial Statements and the notes thereto and the MD&A in Item 7 of the Companies' combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (File Nos.1-14514 and 1-01217, the Form 10-K) and the MD&A in Part 1, Item 2 of the Companies' combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 (File Nos. 114514 and 1-01217).

Information in any item of this report referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.

Con Edison, incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of CECONY, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and Con Edison Transmission, Inc. As used in this report, the term the "Utilities" refers to CECONY and O&R.

Con Edison's principal business operations are those of the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY's principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R's principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. Con Edison Transmission, through its subsidiaries, invests in electric transmission projects supporting Con Edison's effort to transition to clean, renewable energy and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects that will bring clean, renewable electricity to customers focusing on New York and the Northeast. See "Investments" in Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. On March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note R and Note S to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric transmission assets. Con Edison invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe and clean energy critical for its New York and New Jersey customers. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.

In addition to the Companies' material contingencies described in Notes B, G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements, the Companies' management considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be important to understanding the Companies' current and future financial condition.

Aged Accounts Receivable Balances
---------------------------------

At September 30, 2024, CECONY's and O&R's customer accounts receivables balances of $2,904 million and $123 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,654 million and $34 million, respectively. In comparison, CECONY's and O&R's customer accounts receivable balances at February 28, 2020 were $1,322 million and $89 million, respectively, including aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $408 million and $15 million, respectively. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities' practice was to write off customer accounts receivables as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment or the account is closed during the collection process. In general, the Utilities suspended collection activities and service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities. CECONY's rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances (from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) to amounts reflected in rates, with recovery/refund from or to customers via surcharge/sur-credit. CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivable balances will, collectively, be subject to separate annual caps for electric and gas that produce no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact per commodity (estimated for electric to be $57.3 million, $60.3 million, $62.6 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and for gas to be $14.8 million, $15.9 million and $16.8 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively). CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivables for steam will each be subject to an annual cap that produces no more than half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact (estimated to be $2.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.5 million for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively). Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in CECONY's next base rate cases. O&R's 2022 - 2024 rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges to amounts reflected in rates for years 2022 through 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/surcredit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity and reconciliation of write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances to amounts reflected in rates from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/sur-credit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity. Although these regulatory mechanisms are in place, a continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies' liquidity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources," below, and Note B and Note L to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

In May 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order implementing amendments to certain provisions of the New York State Public Service Law that require utilities, including CECONY and O&R, to bill most residential and small non-residential customers within three months instead of six months of the end of their service period, to provide 13 months of usage information on all electric, gas and steam bills and to make available two years of historical billing information upon customer request. The NYSPSC also ordered the NYSDPS to further consider regulations that would expand the new billing requirements to large non-residential customers and to prohibit utilities, including CECONY and O&R, from recovering revenue lost due to untimely billing.

Clean Energy Goals
------------------

The success of the Companies' efforts to meet federal, state and city clean energy policy goals and the impact of energy consumers' efforts to meet such goals on CECONY's electric, gas and steam businesses and O&R's electric and gas businesses may impact the Companies' future financial condition. The Utilities expect electric usage to increase and gas and steam usage to decrease in their service territories as federal, state and local laws and policies are enacted and implemented that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy that is consumed in their respective jurisdictions. The Utilities' and their regulators' efforts to maintain electric reliability in their service territories as electric usage increases may also impact the Companies' future financial condition. The long-term future of the Utilities' gas businesses depends upon the role that natural gas or other gaseous fuels will play in facilitating New York State's and New York City's climate goals. In addition, the impact and costs of climate change on the Utilities' systems and the success of the Utilities' efforts to maintain system reliability and manage service interruptions resulting from severe weather may impact the Companies' future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Con Edison Transmission
-----------------------

Con Edison Transmission, through its New York Transco partnership and jointly NYPA, is developing the Propel NY Energy transmission project that will deliver offshore wind energy from Long Island to New York City, Westchester County and the rest of New York State's high voltage power grid. Con Edison Transmission is also participating in competitive solicitations to develop additional electric projects, including a proposal submitted in April 2024 with another entity to build transmission infrastructure that will carry offshore wind power to New Jersey's electric grid and multiple proposals submitted in June 2024 through its New York Transco partnership to integrate electricity produced from offshore wind into New York City's energy grid. The success of Con Edison Transmission's efforts in these competitive solicitations and to grow its electric transmission portfolio may impact Con Edison's future capital requirements.

CECONY
------

Electric
--------

CECONY provides electric service to approximately 3. 7 million customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million.

During the summer of 2024, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area was 11,822 MW (which occurred on July 16, 2024). At design conditions, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area would have been approximately 12,540 MW in 2024 compared to the company's forecast of 12,800 MW. The lower peak demand at design conditions as compared to the forecast primarily reflects lower than anticipated new business. CECONY increased its five-year forecast of average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 0.7 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 1.0 percent (for 2025 to 2029).

Gas
---

CECONY delivers gas to approximately 1. 1 million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County.

In June 2024, CECONY decreased its five-year forecast of average annual growth of the firm peak gas demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 0.8 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 0.1 percent (for 2025 to 2029). The decrease is reflective of and aligned with state and local clean energy future policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas.

Steam
-----

CECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximately 15,444 MMlb of steam annually to approximately 1,510 customers in parts of Manhattan.

In June 2024, CECONY increased its five-year forecast of the average annual peak steam demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.5 percent decrease (for 2024 to 2028) to a 0.4 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029). The increase is reflective of and aligned with local policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas along with an anticipated increase in oil-to-steam customer conversions.

Collective Bargaining Agreement
-------------------------------

In June 2024, CECONY reached a collective bargaining agreement with its largest union covering approximately 7,300 employees. The union subsequently ratified the four-year agreement with an effective date of June 23, 2024.

O&R
---

Electric
--------

O&R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) (together referred to herein as O&R) provide electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey an approximately 1,300 square mile service area.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

During the summer of 2024, electric peak demand in O&R's service area was 1,484 MW (which occurred on July 16, 2024). At design conditions, electric peak demand in O&R's service area would have been approximately 1,533 MW in 2024 compared to O&R's forecast of 1,530 MW. O&R increased its five-year forecast of average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions from approximately 2.0 percent (for 2024 to 2028) to approximately 3.7 percent (for 2025 to 2029).

Gas
---

O&R delivers gas to over 0 .1 million customers in southeastern New York.

In June 2024, O&R increased its five-year forecast of the average annual firm peak gas demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.2 percent decrease (for 2024 to 2028) to a 0.1 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029). This change is reflective of and aligned with state clean energy future policies driving the phase-out of the use of natural gas.

Inflation Reduction Act
-----------------------

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) was signed into law and included a new 15 percent Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). Under the IRA, a corporation is subject to the CAMT if its average annual adjusted financial statement Income for the three taxable year period ending prior to the taxable year exceeds $1,000 million, and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Con Edison and CECONY were not subject to the CAMT in 2023 and are subject to the CAMT beginning in 2024. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.

New York Legislation
--------------------

In April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than $5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of $5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026. New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. As a result of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023, Con Edison's New York State taxable income was higher than $5 million and it was subject to the higher 7.25 percent rate (9.425 percent with the surcharge rate) on its taxable income for tax year 2023, but is not expected to be subject to the higher rate in tax year 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

The Companies monitor the financial markets closely, including borrowing rates and daily cash collections. Increases in aged accounts receivable balances, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates have increased the amount of capital needed by the Utilities and the costs of such capital. See "Interest Rate Risk," below, "Aged Accounts Receivable Balances," above and "Capital Resources," below.

Con Edison and the Utilities have a $2,500 million revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2029, unless extended for an additional one-year term, subject to certain conditions. CECONY has a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2025, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement. See Note D to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

FERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.

The Companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
------------------------------------

The Utilities' cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is primarily affected by factors external to the Utilities, such as customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries.

Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities also recover from customers the amount of property taxes they will pay. The payment of property taxes by the Utilities affects the timing of cash flows and increases the amount of short-term borrowings issued by the Utilities when property taxes are due and as property taxes increase, but generally does not impact net income. See Note J to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

In general, the Utilities suspended service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities in accordance with applicable law. At September 30, 2024, CECONY's and O&R's customer accounts receivables balances of $2,904 million and $123 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,654 million and $34 million, respectively. A continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies' liquidity. See "Aged Accounts Receivable Balances," above.

Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities' New York electric and gas rate plans.

Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for Con Edison were $1,123 million higher than in the 2023 period. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison primarily reflects:

* · an increase in accounts payable of $374 million;

* · a decrease in the revenue decoupling mechanism receivable of $157 million;
* · an increase in accrued interest of $51 million;
* · a decrease in other receivables and other current assets of $44 million; and

The change in other noncurrent liabilities primarily reflects an increase in the deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($814 million) and an increase in the pensions and retiree benefits ($37 million). The increase is offset in part by a decrease in future income tax ( $195 million) and deferred derivative gains - long term ($30 million). See Note B and Note E to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Long-term debt at September 30, 2024 was $1,386 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in long-term debt primarily reflects the 2024 issuances of $1,400 million of debentures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities" above and Note C to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Equity at September 30, 2024 was $727 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in equity primarily reflects net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($1,417 million), capital contributions from Con Edison ($10 5 million ) in 2024 and a change in stock awards ($9 million), offset in part by common stock dividends to Con Edison ($8 04 million ) in 2024.

O&R
---

Current assets at September 30, 2024 were $112 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in current assets primarily reflects an increase in accounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectible accounts ($23 million) (see "Aged Accounts Receivable Balances," above), an increase in prepayments ($22 million), an increase in accounts receivable from affiliated companies ($20 million), an increase in cash and temporary cash investments ($16 million), an increase in the revenue decoupling mechanism receivable ($12 million) and an increase in accrued unbilled revenue ($7 million).

Net plant at September 30, 2024 was $141 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in net plant primarily reflects an increase in electric ($101 million), gas ($56 million) and general ($24 million) plant balances and an increase in construction work in progress ($25 million), offset in part by an increase in accumulated depreciation ($65 million).

Noncurrent assets at September 30, 2024 were $41 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in noncurrent assets primarily reflects an increase in regulatory assets ($52 million) and the fair value of derivative assets ($1 million), offset partially by a decrease in pension and retiree benefits ($12 million).

Current liabilities at September 30, 2024 were $57 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in current liabilities primarily reflects an increase in regulatory liabilities ($34 million) and an increase in accounts payable ($24 million). Noncurrent liabilities at September 30, 2024 were $42 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in noncurrent liabilities primarily reflects an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits ($43 million).

Long-term debt at September 30, 2024 was $124 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in long-term debt primarily reflects the 2024 issuance of $125 million of debentures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities" above and Note C to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Equity at September 30, 2024 was $72 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in equity primarily reflects net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($82 million), capital contributions from Con Edison ($45 million) in 2024 and a change in stock awards ($1 million), offset in part by common stock dividends to Con Edison ($51 million) in 2024 and a decrease in other comprehensive income ($5 million).

Con Edison Transmission
-----------------------

Current assets at September 30, 2024 were $10 million lower than at December 31, 2023. The change in current assets primarily reflects lower cash and temporary investments due to a net investment in New York Transco ($7 million).

Investments at September 30, 2024 were $52 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The increase in investments reflects additional investment and investment income in New York Transco ($32 million) and investment income from MVP ($21 million).

Equity at September 30, 2024 was $33 million higher than at December 31, 2023. The change in equity primarily reflects Con Edison Transmission's earnings ($35 million), offset in part by dividends to Con Edison ($3 million).

Environmental Matters
---------------------

Clean Energy Future

New York State's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act

77

In September 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order evaluating the combined gas system long-term plan (the GSLTP) filed by the Utilities in November 2023. The order directs the Utilities to make additional filings to further the process of decarbonizing their gas systems and achieving the GHG emission reduction targets established in the CLCPA. These additional filings include, among other things, a proposal for a demand response program; a nonpipes alternatives deployment plan; a report on pipeline safety, including records to substantiate maximum allowable operating pressure in certain pipe segments; a definition of hard-to-electrify customers; reports on the benefits to, and impacts on, disadvantaged communities; and a bill impact analysis that reflects reduced natural gas usage over a 20-year period for every service classification. The order also directs the Utilities to include certain information in their annual updates to the GSLTP and in their next GSLTP, due 2027, such as increases in electric load and associated reliability impacts and a description of a scenario that meets all load growth with non-pipe alternatives rather than additional infrastructure, and for the Utilities to identify a preferred pathway among the three pathways set forth in the GSLTP.

Also in September 2024, O&R entered into a settlement agreement that is subject to approval by the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable O&R to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.5 percent for transmission projects that O&R exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years.

In August 2024, CECONY entered into a settlement agreement that is subject to approval by the FERC. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable CECONY to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.6 percent for transmission projects that CECONY exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years.

In August 2024, New York Transco entered into a settlement agreement for its Propel NY Energy project that is subject to approval by the FERC. Con Edison Transmission has a 41.7 percent interest in New York Transco's share of the Propel NY Energy project that is jointly owned with NYPA. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable New York Transco to recover the costs and a return on equity of 11.3 percent (which is comprised of a 10.3 percent return on equity and 75 basis points added for risk and 25 basis points added for grid enhancement). If approved, parties to the settlement agreement would be restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels until after May 31, 2030. In addition, the Propel NY Energy project will receive construction work in progress and abandoned plant incentives.

Also in August 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order instituting a proceeding that directs New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R, to proactively identify and develop grid upgrades needed to meet new demand from transportation and building heating electrification across New York State. The order directs the utilities to develop a joint filing that identifies these needs and describes, among other things, timelines, utility data assumptions, evaluation criteria, cost recovery and cost allocation for projects. The order also allows each individual utility to request approval from the NYSPSC for urgent upgrades that begin construction before the completion of the joint utilities' proposed planning process, which is estimated to occur in the first half of 2026.

In May 2024, CECONY filed its inaugural annual Investing in Disadvantaged Communities Report, as required by the NYSPSC. The report summarizes the impacts of CECONY's investments in disadvantaged communities (DACs) within the company's service territory, based on 2023 data. The report includes, among other things, building electrification and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as data related to the company's long-running electric and gas operations. DAC locations were identified by New York State in connection with the implementation process for the CLCPA.

Offshore Wind
-------------

In February 2024, NYSERDA announced that it selected two offshore wind projects for contract negotiations representing 1,734 MW of energy by 2026. One of the conditional awards, Empire Wind 1, is expected to connect 810 MW of offshore wind electricity to the New York City electrical grid at CECONY's Gowanus substation. In March 2024, FERC approved the interconnection agreement among Empire Offshore Wind, LLC, the NYISO, and CECONY. In May 2024, the NYSPSC approved a certificate of public convenience and necessity to allow construction of Empire Wind 1 to begin.

Energy Storage
--------------

In June 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting an updated roadmap for achieving 6,000 MW of statewide energy storage resource deployment by 2030 and recognized the need for additional statewide energy storage of 12,000 MW by 2040 and 17,000 MW by 2050. The NYSPSC directed New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R, to study the potential of energy storage to provide non-market transmission and distribution services and identify services that are cost-effective compared to traditional alternatives.

Thermal Energy Networks
-----------------------

In April 2024, the NYSDPS approved CECONY's and O&R's December 2023 Stage 1 filings (Project Scope, Feasibility, and Stakeholder Engagement) for utility-scale thermal energy network pilot projects. The NYSDPS also confirmed CECONY and O&R are authorized to incur costs of $17.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, through the completion of Stage 2 (Pilot Project Engineering Design and Customer Protection Plan). These projected costs are within the budgets proposed by CECONY and O&R of $255 million and $46 million, respectively. The remaining proposed budget amounts are subject to approval by the NYSPSC. In May 2024, CECONY filed a petition with the NYSDPS seeking $6 million for certain unaddressed costs that are necessary to complete Stage 2 of its utility thermal energy network pilot projects, in addition to the $17.1 million described above.

Superfund
---------

Gowanus Canal
-------------

The EPA has identified 39 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, including CECONY (which the EPA indicated has facilities that may be a source of PCBs at the site). Certain federal agencies and the NYSDEC also notified potentially responsible parties (PRPs), including CECONY, of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.

In March 2024, CECONY received a notice that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the NYSDEC, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (collectively, the "Trustees") published a Draft Natural Resource Assessment Plan, indicating that the Trustees are conducting a natural resource damage assessment to determine, among other things, the appropriate amount and type of projects needed to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of injured natural resources at the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.

In June 2024, the EPA issued an order amending its January 2020 order and that requires six PRPs, including CECONY, to initiate remedial action work in the middle segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The EPA estimated the cost of this work would be $369 million (although actual costs may be significantly higher) and has indicated the work would take several years to complete.

In the third quarter of 2024, dredging and stabilization was largely completed in the upper segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site, as set forth in the January 2020 order, at a cost of approximately $260 million.

In October 2024, a PRP filed a lawsuit against the other PRPs, including CECONY, with respect to the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The plaintiff asserts claims pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the New York Navigation Law for cleanup costs incurred, and to be incurred, by the plaintiff at the site.

CECONY is unable to estimate its exposure to liability for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.

Other Environmental Matters
---------------------------

In April 2024, a CECONY feeder in the Bronx leaked resulting in a release of approximately one thousand gallons of dielectric fluid (a non-toxic synthetic compound similar to mineral oil), a portion of which migrated to a nearby sewer system and a sheen was seen in the Bronx River. CECONY stopped the feeder leak and began the cleanup on the same day the discharge occurred. CECONY, with assistance from the NYSDEC, also placed booms in the Bronx River at various locations to collect any fluid that made it to the river through the sewer system. CECONY is addressing the remaining sheen on the river, and also voluntarily cleaned up a significant amount of debris and trash in the area of the oil sheen. In April 2024, CECONY also discovered the presence of oil in the Hudson River within the permanent containment boom surrounding Pier 98 that likely originated from an internal leak of approximately 4,400 gallons of oil at CECONY's steam generating plant on 59th Street in Manhattan. CECONY immediately installed an additional containment boom and an absorbent boom in the Hudson River and has estimated that 72 gallons of oil was released to the river. The U.S. Coast Guard, the New York City Department of

Environmental Protection, and the NYSDEC were notified and oversaw the clean-up operations. The costs associated with these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on CECONY's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In connection with the incidents, CECONY may incur monetary sanctions from government agencies of more than $0.3 million for violations of certain provisions regulating the discharge of materials into, and for the protection of, the environment.

For additional information about the Companies' environmental matters, see Note G to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Electric Reliability Needs
--------------------------

CECONY and O&R monitor t he adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in their service areas, and work with other parties on long-term resource adequacy and transmission security within the framework of the NYISO reliability planning process. CECONY has identified and developed a solution for a local reliability need that may begin as soon as the summer of 2026. In October 2024, the NYISO issued its 2024 Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA) that identifies a bulk power system electric reliability need in New York City beginning in the summer of 2033 primarily driven by forecasted increases in peak demand and the assumed retirement of NYPA small gas generating plants as required by New York State law. Following approval of the 2024 RNA by the NYISO board, the NYISO is expected to issue a solicitation for both market-based and regulated solutions. CECONY, as the Responsible Transmission Owner, would propose a regulated backstop solution.

Con Edison Transmission
-----------------------

Con Edison Transmission owns a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco that is comprised of: a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco's Transmission Owner Transmission Solutions (TOTS) projects; a 45.7 percent interest in New York Transco's New York Energy Solution (NYES) project; and a 41.7 percent interest in New York Transco's share of the Propel NY Energy project. Con Edison Transmission also owns a 71.2 percent interest in Honeoye Storage Corporation (H oneoye) and its interest in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) is expected to be approxim ately 6.6 percent. See "Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future - New York State's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act," above.

In June 2024, construction of the Dover Station, an additional network upgrade to support the NYES project, resumed following the reissuance of its permits. Construction is anticipated to be completed by June 2025.

Financial and Commodity Market Risks
------------------------------------

The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.

Interest Rate Risk
------------------

The Companies' interest rate risk primarily relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at September 30, 2024, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $12 million and $10 million, respectively. Under CECONY's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.

Higher interest rates have resulted in increased interest expense on commercial paper, variable-rate debt and long-term debt issuances.

Commodity Price Risk
--------------------

Con Edison's commodity price risk primarily relates to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note N to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Con Edison estimates that, as of September 30, 2024, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $148 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $136 million is for CECONY and $12 million is for O&R. As of September 30, 2023, Con Edison estimated that a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $177 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $165 million is for CECONY and $12 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased.

The Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity or gas they sell. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from full-service customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for those customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. However, increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances.

Investment Risk
---------------

The Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Con Edison's investment risk also relates to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See "Investments" in Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

The Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 26 to 30 percent equity securities, 42 to 60 percent debt securities and 14 to 30 percent alternatives. At September 30, 2024, the pension plan investments consisted of 28 percent equity securities, 51 percent debt securities and 21 percent alternatives.

For the Utilities' pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans.

Material Contingencies
----------------------

For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies' material contingencies, see "Other Regulatory Matters" in Note B and Notes G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
------------------------------------------------------------------

For information about the Companies' primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial and Commodity Market Risks," in Part I, Item 2 of this report, that is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 4: Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------

The Companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

There was no change in the Companies' internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companies' most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies' internal control over financial reporting.
