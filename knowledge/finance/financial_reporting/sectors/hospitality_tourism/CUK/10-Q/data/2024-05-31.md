<h2>CARNIVAL CORPORATION &amp; PLC</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(UNAUDITED)</p>
<h2>NOTE 1 - General</h2>
<p>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, they are referred to collectively in these consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this joint Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as "Carnival Corporation &amp; plc," "our," "us" and "we."</p>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in the opinion of our management, contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. The preparation of our interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed. We have made reasonable estimates and judgments of such items within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. Our operations are seasonal and results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.</p>
<p>Our interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in the Carnival Corporation &amp; plc 2023 joint Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 26, 2024.</p>
<p>For 2023, we reclassified $11 million from restricted cash to prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $94 million from other financing activities to debt issuance costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to the current year presentation.</p>
<h2>Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This guidance requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. On December 1, 2023, we adopted this guidance using the retrospective method for each period presented. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . This guidance requires annual and interim disclosure of significant segment expenses that are provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") as well as interim disclosures for all reportable segments' profit or loss and assets. This guidance also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. This guidance is required to be adopted by us in 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This guidance requires disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction, as well as other amendments relating to income tax disclosures. This guidance is required to be adopted by us in 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<h2>Regulatory Updates</h2>
<p>We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") on January 1, 2024, which includes athree-year phase-in period. The ETS regulates emissions through a "cap and trade" principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of certain emissions that can be emitted and requires us to procure emission allowances for certain emissions inside EU waters (as defined in the ETS). We record emission allowances at cost within prepaid expenses and other or other assets, based on the timing of when they are required to be surrendered. We record expense for emissions inside EU waters within fuel expense in the period incurred. As of May 31, 2024, the cost of allowances purchased was $49 million. For the three and six months ended May 31, 2024, expense for ETS emissions were not material.</p>
<h2>NOTE 2 - Revenue and Expense Recognition</h2>
<p>Guest cruise deposits and advance onboard purchases are initially included in customer deposits when received. Customer deposits are subsequently recognized as cruise revenues, together with revenues from onboard and other activities, and all associated direct costs and expenses of a voyage are recognized as cruise costs and expenses, upon completion of voyages with durations of ten nights or less and on a pro rata basis for voyages in excess of ten nights. The impact of recognizing these shorter duration cruise revenues and costs and expenses on a completed voyage basis versus on a pro rata basis is not material. Certain of our product offerings are bundled and we allocate the value of the bundled services and goods between passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues based upon the estimated standalone selling prices of those goods and services. Guest cancellation fees, when applicable, are recognized in passenger ticket revenues at the time of cancellation.</p>
<p>Our sales to guests of air and other transportation to and from airports near the home ports of our ships are included in passenger ticket revenues, and the related costs of these services are included in prepaid expenses and other when paid prior to the start of a voyage and are subsequently recognized in transportation costs at the time of revenue recognition. The cost of prepaid air and other transportation costs at May 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 were $282 million and $253 million. The proceeds that we collect from the sales of third-party shore excursions are included in onboard and other revenues and the related costs are included in onboard and other costs. The amounts collected on behalf of our onboard concessionaires, net of the amounts remitted to them, are included in onboard and other revenues as concession revenues. All of these amounts are recognized on a completed voyage or pro rata basis as discussed above.</p>
<p>Passenger ticket revenues include fees, taxes and charges collected by us from our guests. The fees, taxes and charges that vary with guest head counts are expensed in commissions, transportation and other costs when the corresponding revenues are recognized. The remaining portion of fees, taxes and charges are generally expensed in other operating expenses when the corresponding revenues are recognized.</p>
<p>Revenues and expenses from our hotel and transportation operations, which are included in our Tour and Other segment, are recognized at the time the services are performed.</p>
<h2>Customer Deposits</h2>
<p>Our payment terms generally require an initial deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the voyage. Cash received from guests in advance of the cruise is recorded in customer deposits and in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include refundable deposits. In certain situations, we have provided flexibility to guests by allowing guests to rebook at a future date, receive future cruise credits ("FCCs") or elect to receive refunds in cash. We record a liability for FCCs to the extent we have received and not refunded cash from guests for cancelled bookings. We had total customer deposits of $8.3 billion as of May 31, 2024 and $6.4 billion as of November 30, 2023, which includes approximately $60 million of unredeemed FCCs as of May 31, 2024, of which approximately $36 million are refundable. At November 30, 2023, we had approximately $134 million of unredeemed FCCs, of which $111 million were refundable. During the six months ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenues of $4.7 billion and $3.6 billion related to our customer deposits as of November 30, 2023 and 2022. Our customer deposits balance changes due to the seasonal nature of cash collections, which typically results from higher ticket prices and occupancy levels during the third quarter, the recognition of revenue, refunds of customer deposits and foreign currency changes.</p>
<h2>Trade and Other Receivables</h2>
<p>Although we generally require full payment from our customers prior to or concurrently with their cruise, we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue source. We have receivables from credit card merchants and travel agents for cruise</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<p>ticket purchases and onboard revenue. These receivables are included within trade and other receivables, net and are less allowances for expected credit losses.</p>
<h2>Contract Costs</h2>
<p>We recognize incremental travel agent commissions and credit and debit card fees incurred as a result of obtaining the ticket contract as assets when paid prior to the start of a voyage. We record these amounts within prepaid expenses and other and subsequently recognize these amounts as commissions, transportation and other at the time of revenue recognition or at the time of voyage cancellation. We had incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers recognized as assets of $434 million as of May 31, 2024 and $294 million as of N ovember 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Revolving Facilities</h2>
<p>We had $3.0 billion available for borrowing under our Revolving Facility as of May 31, 2024. We may continue to borrow or otherwise utilize available amounts under the Revolving Facility through August 2024, subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the facility.</p>
<p>Carnival Holdings II has a $2.5 billion New Revolving Facility which may be utilized from August 2024 through August 2027, replacing our Revolving Facility upon its maturity in August 2024. The New Revolving Facility was extended from 2025 to 2027 and contains an accordion feature, which Carnival Holdings II partially exercised in 2024 to increase commitments from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. The accordion feature allows for further additional commitments not to exceed the aggregate commitments under our Revolving Facility.</p>
<h2>Repricing of Senior Secured Term Loans</h2>
<p>In April 2024, we entered into amendments with the lender syndicate to reprice $1.7 billion of our first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2028 and $1.0 billion of our senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2027, which are included within the total Secured Subsidiary Guaranteed Loans balance in the debt table above.</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<h2>2030 Senior Unsecured Notes</h2>
<p>In April 2024, we issued $535 million aggregate principal amount of 5.8% senior unsecured notes due 2030. We used the net proceeds from the issuance, together with cash on hand, to redeem the outstanding principal amount of the 7.6% senior unsecured notes due 2026.</p>

</ul>
<p>The aggregate amount of these prepayments was $3.2 billion.</p>

<p>During the six months ended May 31, 2024, we borrowed $2.3 billion under export credit facilities due in semi-annual installments through 2036. As of May 31, 2024, the net book value of the vessels subject to negative pledges was $18.8 billion.</p>
<h2>Collateral and Priority Pool</h2>
<p>As of May 31, 2024, the net book value of our ships and ship improvements, excluding ships under construction, is $40.0 billion. Our secured debt is secured on a firstpriority basis by certain collateral, which includes vessels and certain assets related to those vessels and material intellectual property (combined net book value of approximately $22.8 billion, including $21.1 billion related to vessels and certain assets related to those vessels) as of May 31, 2024 and certain other assets.</p>
<p>As of May 31, 2024, $8.1 billion in net book value of our ships and ship improvements relate to the priority pool vessels included in the priority pool of12 unencumbered vessels (the "Senior Priority Notes Subject Vessels") for our 2028 Senior Priority Notes and $2.9 billion in net book value of our ship and ship improvements relate to the priority pool vessels included in the priority pool of three unencumbered vessels (the "New Revolving Facility Subject Vessels") for our New Revolving Facility. As of May 31, 2024, there was no change in the identity of the Senior Priority Notes Subject Vessels or the New Revolving Facility Subject Vessels.</p>
<h2>Covenant Compliance</h2>
<p>As of May 31, 2024, our Revolving Facility, New Revolving Facility, unsecured loans and export credit facilities contain certain covenants listed below:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<p>At May 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under our debt agreements.Gen erally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then, pursuant to cross-default and/or cross-acceleration clauses therein, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and our debt and derivative contracts could be terminated. Any financial covenant amendment may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable.</p>
<h2>NOTE 4 - Contingencies and Commitments</h2>
<h2>Litigation</h2>
<p>We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business. We have insurance coverage for certain of these claims and actions, or any settlement of these claims and actions, and historically the maximum amount of our liability, net of any insurance recoverables, has been limited to our self-insurance retention levels.</p>
<p>We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.</p>
<p>Legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed, on May 2, 2019, the Havana Docks Corporation filed a lawsuit against Carnival Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act, alleging that Carnival Corporation "trafficked" in confiscated Cuban property when certain ships docked at certain ports in Cuba, and that this alleged "trafficking" entitles the plaintiffs to treble damages. On March 21, 2022, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Havana Docks Corporation as to liability. On December 30, 2022, the court entered judgment against Carnival Corporation in the amount of $110 million plus $4 million in fees and costs. We have filed an appeal. Oral argument was held on May 17, 2024.</p>
<p>As of May 31, 2024,two purported class actions brought against us by former guests in the Federal Court in Australia and in Italy remain pending, as previously disclosed. These actions include claims based on a variety of theories, including negligence, gross negligence and failure to warn, physical injuries and severe emotional distress associated with being exposed to and/or contracting COVID-19 onboard our ships. On October 24, 2023, the court in the Australian matter held that we were liable for negligence and for breach of consumer protection warranties as it relates to the lead plaintiff. The court ruled that the lead plaintiff was not entitled to any pain and suffering or emotional distress damages on the negligence claim and awarded medical costs. In relation to the consumer protection warranties claim, the court found that distress and disappointment damages amounted to no more than the refund already provided to guests and therefore made no further award. Further proceedings will determine the applicability of this ruling to the remaining class participants. We continue to take actions to defend against the above claims. We believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Regulatory or Governmental Inquiries and Investigations</h2>
<p>We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by breaches in data security and lapses in data privacy, which occur from time to time. These can vary in scope and range from inadvertent events to malicious motivated attacks.</p>
<p>We have incurred legal and other costs in connection with cyber incidents that have impacted us. The penalties and settlements paid in connection with cyber incidents over recent years were not material. While these incidents did not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity, no assurances can be given about the future and we may be subject to future attacks, incidents or litigation that could have such a material adverse effect.</p>
<p>On March 14, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notified us of potential civil penalties and injunctive relief for alleged Clean Water Act violations by owned and operated vessels covered by the 2013 Vessel General Permit. We are working with these agencies to reach a resolution of this matter. We believe the ultimate outcome will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Other Contingent Obligations</h2>
<p>Some of the debt contracts we enter into include indemnification provisions obligating us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes or changes in laws which increase the lender's costs. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses, and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses.</p>
<p>We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related to our cruise vacations. Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under certain circumstances, that we provide a capped reserve fund in cash. Although the agreements vary, these requirements may generally be satisfied either through a withheld percentage of customer payments or providing cash funds directly to the credit card processor.</p>
<p>As of May 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we had $25 million and $844 million in reserve funds. Additionally, as of May 31, 2024 and Nov ember 30, 2023, we had $51 million and $158 million in compensating deposits we are required to maintain. These balances are included within other assets as of May 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Ship Commitments</h2>
<p>As of May 31, 2024, our new ship growth capital commitments were $0.1 billion for the remainder of 2024 and $0.9 billion, $0.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ending November 30, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.</p>
<h2>NOTE 5 - Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Financial Risks</h2>
<h2>Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs in one of the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1 measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Valuation of these items does not entail a significant amount of judgment.</li>
<li>· Level 2 measurements are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>· Level 3 measurements are based on unobservable data that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, certain estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.</p>

<h2>Financial Risks</h2>
<h2>Fuel Price Risks</h2>
<p>We manage our exposure to fuel price risk by managing our consumption of fuel. Substantially all of our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships. We manage fuel consumption through fleet optimization, energy efficiency, itinerary efficiency and new technologies and alternative fuels.</p>
<h2>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks</h2>
<h2>Overall Strategy</h2>
<p>We manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through our normal operating and financing activities, including netting certain exposures to take advantage of any natural offsets and, when considered appropriate, through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Our primary focus is to monitor our exposure to, and manage, the economic foreign currency exchange risks faced by our operations and realized if we exchange one currency for another. We consider hedging certain of our ship commitments and net investments in foreign operations. The financial impacts of our hedging instruments generally offset the changes in the underlying exposures being hedged.</p>
<h2>Operational Currency Risks</h2>
<p>Our operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar, Euro, Sterling or the Australian dollar as their functional currencies. Our operations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our financial statements.</p>
<h2>Investment Currency Risks</h2>
<p>We consider our investments in foreign operations to be denominated in stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We have euro-denominated debt which provides an economic offset for our operations with euro functional currency. In addition, we</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<p>have in the past and may in the future utilize derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to manage our exposure to investment currency risks.</p>
<h2>Newbuild Currency Risks</h2>
<p>Our shipbuilding contracts are typically denominated in euros. Our decision to hedge a non-functional currency ship commitment for our cruise brands is made on a case-by-case basis, considering the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility, economic trends, our overall expected net cash flows by currency and other offsetting risks.</p>
<p>At May 31, 2024, our remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk relates to euro-denominated newbuild contract payments for non-euro functional currency brands, which represent a total unhedged commitment of $2.1 billion for newbuilds scheduled to be delivered through 2027.</p>
<p>The cost of shipbuilding orders that we may place in the future that are denominated in a different currency than our cruise brands' functional currency will be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our decision to order new cruise ships.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risks</h2>
<p>We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our debt portfolio management and investment strategies. We evaluate our debt portfolio to determine whether to make periodic adjustments to the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps and the issuance of new debt.</p>
<h2>Concentrations of Credit Risk</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing control procedures, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. We seek to manage these credit risk exposures, including counterparty nonperformance primarily associated with our cash and cash equivalents, investments, notes receivables, reserve funds related to customer deposits, future financing facilities, contingent obligations, derivative instruments, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Conducting business with well-established financial institutions, insurance companies and export credit agencies</li>
<li>· Diversifying our counterparties</li>
<li>· Having guidelines regarding credit ratings and investment maturities that we follow to help safeguard liquidity and minimize risk</li>
<li>· Generally requiring collateral and/or guarantees to support notes receivable on significant asset sales and new ship progress payments to shipyards</li>
</ul>
<p>We also monitor the creditworthiness of travel agencies and tour operators in Australia and Europe and credit and debit card providers to which we extend credit in the normal course of our business. Our credit exposure also includes contingent obligations related to cash payments received directly by travel agents and tour operators for cash collected by them on cruise sales in Australia and most of Europe where we are obligated to honor our guests' cruise payments made by them to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether we have received these payments.</p>
<p>Concentrations of credit risk associated with trade receivables and other receivables, charter-hire agreements and contingent obligations are not considered to be material, principally due to the large number of unrelated accounts, the nature of these contingent obligations and their short maturities. Normally, we have not required collateral or other security to support normal credit sales and have not experienced significant credit losses.</p>
<h2>NOTE 6 - Segment Information</h2>
<p>The chief operating decision maker, who is the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Climate Officer of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc assesses performance and makes decisions to allocate resources for Carnival Corporation &amp; plc based upon review of the results across all of our segments. The operating segments within each of our reportable segments have been aggregated based on the similarity of their economic and other characteristics, including geographic guest sourcing. Our four reportable segments are comprised of (1) NAA cruise operations, (2) Europe cruise operations ("Europe"), (3) Cruise Support and (4) Tour and Other.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Our Cruise Support segment includes our portfolio of leading port destinations and exclusive islands as well as other services, all of which are operated for the benefit of our cruise brands. Our Tour and Other segment represents the hotel and transportation operations of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours and other operations.</p>

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. We have tried, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like "will," "may," "could," "should," "would," "believe," "depends," "expect," "goal," "aspiration," "anticipate," "forecast," "project," "future," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "target," "indicate," "outlook," and similar expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms.</p>
<p>Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. This note contains important cautionary statements of the known factors that we consider could materially affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Events and conditions around the world, including geopolitical uncertainty, war and other military actions, inflation, higher fuel prices, higher interest rates and other general concerns impacting the ability or desire of people to travel have led, and may in the future lead, to a decline in demand for cruises as well as negative impacts to our operating costs and profitability.</li>
<li>· Pandemics have in the past and may in the future have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations.</li>
<li>· Incidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise industry have in the past and may, in the future, negatively impact the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage.</li>
<li>· Changes in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection, labor and employment, and tax may be costly and have in the past and may, in the future, lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage.</li>
<li>· Factors associated with climate change, including evolving and increasing regulations, increasing global concern about climate change and the shift in climate conscious consumerism and stakeholder scrutiny, and increasing frequency and/or severity of adverse weather conditions could adversely affect our business.</li>
<li>· Inability to meet or achieve our targets, goals, aspirations, initiatives, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, including those that are related to sustainability matters, may expose us to risks that may adversely impact our business.</li>
<li>· Breaches in data security and lapses in data privacy as well as disruptions and other damages to our principal offices, information technology operations and system networks and failure to keep pace with developments in technology may adversely impact our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and may lead to reputational damage.</li>
<li>· The loss of key team members, our inability to recruit or retain qualified shoreside and shipboard team members and increased labor costs could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</li>
<li>· Increases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs.</li>
<li>· We rely on supply chain vendors who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers may be unable to deliver on their commitments, which could negatively impact our business.</li>
<li>· Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results.</li>
<li>· Overcapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may negatively impact our cruise sales, pricing and destination options.</li>
<li>· Inability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests.</li>
<li>· We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including those beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate cash required to service our debt and sustain our operations.</li>
<li>· Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ordering of the risk factors set forth above is not intended to reflect our indication of priority or likelihood. Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently, and in the future may continue to be, amplified by our substantial debt</p>

<p>balance incurred during the pause of our guest cruise operations. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown.</p>
<p>Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange rules, we expressly disclaim any obligation to disseminate, after the date of this document, any updates or revisions to any such forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based.</p>
<p>Forward-looking and other statements in this document may also address our sustainability progress, plans, and goals (including climate change and environmentalrelated matters). In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability- and climate-related statements may be based on standards and tools for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions and predictions that are subject to change in the future and may not be generally shared.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>Refer to Note 1 -" General, Accounting Pronouncements" of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding Accounting Pronouncements .</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" that is included in the Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>Our passenger ticket revenues are seasonal. Demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is typically earned during this period. Our results are also impacted by ships being taken out-of-service for planned maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak seasons. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours' revenue and operating income is generated from May through September in conjunction with Alaska's cruise season.</p>
<h2>Known Trends and Uncertainties</h2>
<ul>
<li>· We believe the volatility in the price of fuel and foreign currency exchange rates are reasonably likely to impact our profitability.</li>
<li>We believe a global minimum tax could affect us in 2026, with the potential for a one-year deferral. Prior to any mitigating actions, we believe the annual impact could be approximately $200 million. We continue to evaluate the impact of these rules and are currently evaluating a variety of mitigating actions to minimize the impact. The application of the rules continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter our tax obligations in certain countries in which we operate.</li>
<li>· We believe the increasing global focus on climate change, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and new and evolving regulatory requirements, is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results. We became subject to the EU ETS on January 1, 2024, which includes a threeyear phase-in period. The impact in 2024 will be approximately $50 million.</li>

<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<p>We had a working capital deficit of $9.6 billion as of May 31, 2024 compared to a working capital deficit of $6.2 billion as of November 30, 2023. The increase in working capital deficit was substantially all due to an increase in customer deposits, a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other. We operate with a substantial working capital deficit. This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, substantially all of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date. These advance passenger receipts generally remain a current liability on our balance sheet until the sailing date. The cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources, such as our borrowings and other cash from operations. The cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses, pay down our debt, make long-term investments or any other use of cash. Included within our working capital are $7.9 billion and $6.1 billion of customer deposits as of May 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related to our cruise vacations. Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under certain circumstances, that we provide a capped reserve fund in cash. In addition, we have a relatively low level of accounts receivable and limited investment in inventories.</p>
<h2>Sources and Uses of Cash</h2>
<h2>Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Our business provided $3.8 billion of net cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended May 31, 2024, an increase of $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion provided for the same period in 2023. This was caused by an increase in cash provided by the release of substantially all credit card reserves (included in the change in prepaid expenses and other assets), a decrease in the net loss compared to the same period in 2023 and other working capital changes.</p>
<h2>Investing Activities</h2>
<p>During the six months ended May 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion. This was caused by capital expenditures of $3.5 billion primarily attributable to the delivery of a 5,360 and a 4,310-passenger capacity NAA segment ships and one 2,960-passenger capacity Europe segment ship.</p>
<p>During the six months ended May 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion. This was driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion primarily attributable to the delivery of one 5,280-passenger capacity Europe segment ship</li>
<li>· Proceeds from sales of one 2,700-passenger capacity Europe segment ship, one 1,270-passenger capacity Europe segment ship and one 460-passenger capacity NAA segment ship totaling $255 million</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financing Activities</h2>
<p>During the six months ended May 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion was caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Repayments of $4.1 billion of long-term debt</li>
<li>· Debt issuance costs of $117 million</li>
<li>· Debt extinguishment costs of $41 million</li>
<li>· Issuances of $3.0 billion of long-term debt</li>
</ul>
<p>During the six months ended May 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of $1.6 billion was driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Repayments of $0.2 billion of short-term borrowings</li>
<li>· Repayments of $2.3 billion of long-term debt</li>
<li>· Issuances of $1.0 billion of long-term debt</li>
<li>· Payments of $94 million related to debt issuance costs</li>
<li>· Purchases of $20 million of Carnival plc ordinary shares and issuances of $22 million of Carnival Corporation common stock under our Stock Swap Program</li>
</ul>
<h2>Funding Sources</h2>
<p>As of May 31, 2024, we had $4.6 billion of liquidity including $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion of borrowings available under our Revolving Facility, which matures in August 2024, at which point it will be replaced by the New Revolving Facility available through August 2027. Refer to Note 3 - "Debt" of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. In addition, we had $2.2 billion of undrawn export credit facilities to fund ship deliveries planned through 2027. We plan to use existing liquidity and future cash flows from operations to fund our cash requirements including capital expenditures not funded by our export credit facilities. We seek to manage our credit risk exposures, including counterparty</p>
<p>nonperformance associated with our cash and cash equivalents, and future financing facilities by conducting business with well-established financial institutions, and export credit agencies and diversifying our counterparties.</p>

<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>

<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<h2>A. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Climate Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded, as of May 31, 2024, that they are effective to provide a reasonable level of assurance, as described above.</p>
<h2>B. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended May 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>The legal proceedings described in Note 4 - "Contingencies and Commitments" of our consolidated financial statements, including those described under "Regulatory or Governmental Inquiries and Investigations," are incorporated in this "Legal Proceedings" section by reference. Additionally, SEC rules require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we believe may exceed $1 million for such proceedings.</p>
<p>On June 20, 2022, Princess Cruises notified the Australian Maritime Safety Authorization ("AMSA") and the flag state, Bermuda, regarding approximately six cubic meters of comminuted food waste (liquid biodigester effluent) inadvertently released by Coral Princess inside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. On June 23, 2022, the UK P&amp;I Club N.V. provided a letter of undertaking for approximately $1.9 million (being the estimated maximum combined penalty). On May 31, 2023, we received a summons from the Australia Federal Prosecution Service indicating that formal charges are being pursued against Princess Cruises and the Captain of the vessel. We believe the ultimate outcome will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>On February 5, 2024, P&amp;O Cruises (Australia) notified AMSA and the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch that a small amount of oil may have inadvertently contaminated grey water which was discharged by Pacific Adventure in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Queensland. We are conducting an internal investigation and intend to cooperate with any inquiries from governmental authorities. We believe the ultimate outcome will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors.</h2>
<p>The risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," included in the Form 10-K, and there has been no material change to these risk factors since the Form 10-K filing. These risks should be carefully considered, and could materially and adversely affect our results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.</h2>
<h2>A. Stock Swap Program</h2>
<p>Our Stock Swap Program allows us to realize a net cash benefit when Carnival Corporation common stock is trading at a premium to the price of Carnival plc ordinary shares. Under the Stock Swap Program, we may elect to offer and sell shares of Carnival Corporation common stock at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers' transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of Carnival plc ordinary shares in the UK market.</p>
<p>Under the Stock Swap Program effective June 2021, the Boards of Directors authorized the sale of up to $500 million of shares of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U.S. market and the repurchase of an equivalent number of Carnival plc ordinary shares.</p>
<p>We may in the future implement a program to allow us to realize a net cash benefit when Carnival plc ordinary shares are trading at a premium to the price of Carnival Corporation common stock.</p>
<p>Any sales of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Since the beginning of the Stock Swap Program, first authorized in June 2021, we have sold 17.2 million shares of Carnival Corporation common stock and repurchased the same amount of Carnival plc ordinary shares, resulting in net proceeds of $29 million. During the three months ended May 31, 2024, there were no sales or repurchases under the Stock Swap Program. During the three months ended May 31, 2024, no shares of Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares were repurchased.</p>
