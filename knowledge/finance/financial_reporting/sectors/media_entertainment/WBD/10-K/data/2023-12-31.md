<h2>PART I</h2>
<h2>CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies, integration of acquired businesses, new product and service offerings, financial prospects and anticipated sources and uses of capital. Words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "future," "intend," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "strategy," "target" and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like "could," "may," "might," "should," "will" and "would," among other terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. The following is a list of some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:</p>
<ul>
<li>· more intense competitive pressure from existing or new competitors in the industries in which we operate;</li>
<li>· reduced spending on domestic and foreign television advertising, due to macroeconomic, industry or consumer behavior trends or unexpected reductions in our number of subscribers;</li>
<li>· uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and provision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies, and the success of our streaming services;</li>
<li>· market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries;</li>
<li>· negative publicity or damage to our brands, reputation or talent;</li>
<li>· realizing direct-to-consumer subscriber goals;</li>
<li>· industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, sports programming, feature film, television and television commercial production;</li>
<li>· the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike, such as the strikes of the Writers Guild of America ("WGA") and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA") in 2023, player lock-outs or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union, athletes or others involved in the development and production of our sports programming, television programming, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements;</li>
<li>· disagreements with our distributors or other business partners;</li>
<li>· continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios;</li>
<li>· potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences or unforeseen increased expenses associated with the WarnerMedia Business or our efforts to integrate the WarnerMedia Business;</li>
<li>· adverse outcomes of legal proceedings or disputes related to our acquisition of the WarnerMedia Business;</li>
<li>· changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, laws and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and similar authorities internationally and data privacy regulations, and adverse outcomes from regulatory or legal proceedings;</li>
<li>· inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial forecasts;</li>
<li>· our level of debt, including the significant indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the WarnerMedia Business, and our future compliance with debt covenants;</li>
<li>· threatened or actual cyber-attacks and cybersecurity breaches;</li>
<li>· theft of our content and unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibition of such content; and</li>
<li>· general economic and business conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, global events such as pandemics, and political unrest in the international markets in which we operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties which change over time, are based on management's expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future results.</p>
<p>These risks have the potential to impact the recoverability of the assets recorded on our balance sheets, including goodwill or other intangibles. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of any forward-looking statements we make, cannot be foreseen with certainty and are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and global economies and regulatory environments, factors specific to Warner Bros. Discovery and other factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."</p>
<p>Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or disclosed in our other SEC filings. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other factors speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1. Business.</h2>
<p>For convenience, the terms "Warner Bros. Discovery", "WBD", the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and collectively to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.</p>
<h2>Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&amp;T</h2>
<p>On April 8, 2022 (the "Closing Date"), Discovery, Inc. ("Discovery") completed its merger (the "Merger") with the WarnerMedia business (the "WarnerMedia Business", "WM Business" or "WM") of AT&amp;T Inc. ("AT&amp;T") and changed its name to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. On April 11, 2022, the Company's shares started trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") under the trading symbol WBD.</p>
<p>The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. (See Note 3 and Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Prior to the Merger, WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. ("WMH") distributed $40.5 billion to AT&amp;T (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WM's retention of certain debt. Discovery transferred purchase consideration of $42.4 billion in equity to AT&amp;T shareholders in the Merger. In August 2022, the Company and AT&amp;T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2 billion payment from AT&amp;T in the third quarter of 2022 in lieu of adjusting the equity issued as consideration in the Merger. AT&amp;T shareholders received shares of WBD Series A common stock ("WBD common stock") in the Merger representing 71% of the combined Company and the Company's pre-Merger shareholders continued to own 29% of the combined Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the WM Business for accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"); therefore, Discovery is considered the Company's predecessor and the historical financial statements of Discovery prior to April 8, 2022, are reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of the Company as of and for any periods prior to April 8, 2022 do not include the financial results of the WM Business and current and future results will not be comparable to results prior to the Merger.</p>
<h2>Industry Trends</h2>
<p>The WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ("AMPTP"). The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023.</p>
<p>The strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company, including a pause on certain theatrical and television productions. Effects included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company's ability to produce, license, and deliver content.</p>
<p>Other headwinds in the industry, such as continued pressures on linear distribution and soft advertising markets in the U.S., have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company, including a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to declines in linear advertising revenue.</p>
<p>We continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of industry trends to our business; however, the full effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.</p>

<h2>COMPETITION</h2>
<p>Providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. There is competition from other production studios, other television networks, and online-based content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. In addition, the composition of our competitors has evolved with the entrance of new market participants, including companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing, and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.</p>
<p>Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.</p>
<p>Direct-to-Consumer subscriber - We define a "Core DTC Subscription" as: 1</p>
<p>(i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product (defined below) for which we have recognized subscription revenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has activated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; (iv) a retail or wholesale subscription to an independently-branded, regional product sold on a stand-alone basis that includes discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, and/or a Premium Sports Product, for which we have recognized subscription revenue (as per (i)-(iii) above); and (v) users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.</p>
<p>The Company defines a "Premium Sports Product" as a strategically prioritized, sports-focused product sold on a stand-alone basis and made available directly to consumers. The current "independently-branded, regional products" referred to in (iv) above consist of TVN/Player and BluTV. We may refer to the aggregate number of DTC Subscriptions as "subscribers".</p>
<p>The reported number of "subscribers" included herein and the definition of "DTC Subscription" as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV) that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) a limited number of international discovery+ subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic and international Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a DTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next month as noted above.</p>
<p>Our networks and streaming services, which include Max, HBO Max, and discovery+, compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks, and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Our networks and streaming services also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, streaming services, pay-per-view and video-on-demand ("VOD") services, online activities and other forms of news, information and media entertainment.</p>
<h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<p>We are one of the world's leading creators, owners and distributors of intellectual property.Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in films, television programs, software, comic books and mobile apps; trademarks in names, logos and characters; patents or patent applications for inventions related to products and services; websites; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds from third parties. We have made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and streaming services, including Max, HBO Max, and discovery+, and consider these platforms to be intellectual property assets as well.</p>
<p>We are a global media and entertainment company and the protection of our content and brands is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, unfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories, and new legislative or regulatory initiatives could impact our operations.</p>
<p>We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective.Piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signals, and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. Piracy also includes the unauthorized use of our intellectual property on physical goods. We have a team dedicated to disrupting and curbing piracy and other forms of intellectual property infringement and use external vendors to detect and remove infringements, whether digital in nature or on physical goods. We also engage with intermediaries that facilitate piracy, leverage our membership in a range of industry groups, and initiate enforcement actions, including litigation, to address piracy issues. In general, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. Further, new technologies such as generative AI and their impact on our intellectual property rights remain uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses or result in infringement claims against us.</p>
<p>Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations.</p>
<h2>REGULATORY MATTERS</h2>
<p>Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the E.U., in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated in certain limited respects by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators and other distributors, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and describe only the most significant regulations we face; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.</p>
<h2>Program Access</h2>
<p>The Communications Act (the "Act") and the FCC's program access rules prevent a content vendor in which a cable operator has an "attributable" ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of the vendor's content networks, on the basis of the non-affiliation. These rules permit the unaffiliated MVPD to initiate a complaint to the FCC against the content vendor and content networks if it believes this rule has been violated.</p>
<h2>Program Carriage</h2>
<p>The Act and the FCC's program carriage rules prohibit MVPDs from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated, similarly situated content networks in the rates, terms and conditions of their carriage agreements in a manner that unreasonably restrains the ability of the unaffiliated content network to compete fairly. These rules permit the unaffiliated content network to initiate a complaint to the FCC against the MVPD if it believes these rules have been violated, but court decisions interpreting the regulations have made it difficult for us to challenge a distributor's decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or discriminate against one of our content networks.</p>
<h2>"Must-Carry"/Retransmission Consent</h2>
<p>The Act imposes "must-carry" regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market if they elect mandatory carriage. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC's implementation of "must-carry" obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our content networks by cable and DBS operators. The Act also gives certain broadcasters the choice of opting out of must-carry and invoking the right to retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster's right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster's consent before distributing the broadcaster's signal to the MVPDs' subscribers, often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us.</p>
<h2>Accessibility, Children's Advertising Restrictions, Emergency Alerts and CALM Act</h2>
<p>Certain of our content networks and some of our IP-delivered video content must provide closed-captioning and audio description of some of their programming and comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible to persons with disabilities. The U.S. Congress, the FCC, and the U.S. Department of Justice periodically consider proposals to implement additional accessibility requirements, and are considering a number of such proposals now, some of which would increase our obligations substantially. Our television programming intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on the amount and type of permissible advertising, and certain regulations extend to our digital products when they are referenced by web address in our television programming. We may not include actual or simulated emergency alert tones or signals in our content. Commercials embedded in our networks' television content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material.</p>
<h2>Obscenity Restrictions</h2>
<p>MVPDs are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks.</p>
<h2>Regulation of Digital Products and Services</h2>
<p>We operate a variety of free, advertising-based and subscription-based digital products and streaming services providing news, information and entertainment to consumers in the U.S. and international markets via web, mobile and connected TV platforms. In some cases, those products and services are provided directly to consumers, and in other cases, they can be used and/or purchased through a third-party distributor, such as Xfinity or Hulu. Our digital products and services are subject to federal and state regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personal information collected from our users, including laws pertaining to the acquisition of personal information from children under 16. Some examples of these laws include the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). Many additional U.S. state and federal regulations impose data security and data breach obligations on the Company. These laws and their public and private enforcement are continually evolving, with several comprehensive U.S. state privacy laws that took effect in 2023, or that will take effect in 2024, and many more introduced and expected to pass in the coming year, and novel litigation theories related to privacy advancing in the courts. Additional federal and state laws and regulations apply or may be adopted with respect to our digital products and services, covering such issues as data privacy and security, child safety, oversight of user-generated content, advertising, competition, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. The scope of regulation may differ depending on how these products and services are used and/or purchased. In addition, the FCC from time to time considers whether some or all digital services should be considered MVPDs and regulated as such.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property Laws and Regulations</h2>
<p>Our intellectual property assets are discussed under "Business - Intellectual Property" above. Ourcont ent, whether distributed over broadcast, cable, DBS, wireless, or internet-based services, or through other means, is protected under intellectual property law, including copyright, trademark, patent, u nfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws and license agreements. Ch anges to these laws and regulations could either strengthen or weaken our ability to license and protect our content and combat its theft or misuse.</p>
<h2>Foreign Laws and Regulations</h2>
<p>The foreign jurisdictions in which our products and services are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses, including relating to the production, monetization and distribution of content.By way of example, our digital offerings available to consumers in international jurisdictions are subject to laws and regulations relating to, without limitation, consumer protection, data privacy and security, advertising, competition, intellectual property, and content limitations.</p>
<p>Similar to the U.S., new laws and regulations in international jurisdictions may be adopted with respect to our intellectual property, products and services.In particular, we face increased efforts in international jurisdictions to regulate streaming services, which may constrain our offerings. Further, international laws and regulations around intellectual property could limit our ability to license and protect our content, as well as impose additional burdens on our business.</p>

<h2>ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.</h2>
<p>Investing in our securities involves risk. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</p>
<h2>Risks Related to Our Business and Industry</h2>
<h2>Our businesses operate in highly competitive industries and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.</h2>
<p>The media and entertainment industries in which we compete for viewers, distribution and advertising are highly competitive. We face increased competitive pressure for talent, content, audiences, subscribers, service providers, advertising spending and production infrastructure. We compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services, some of whom have interests in multiple media and entertainment businesses that are often vertically integrated, all vying for consumer time, attention and discretionary spending. In addition, the composition of our competitors has evolved with the entrance of new market participants, including companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Such competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information. Our competitors may also consolidate or enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently acquire and produce high quality content amidst a rapidly evolving competitive landscape. In addition, new technology, including generative artificial intelligence ("AI"), is evolving rapidly and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</p>
<p>Our advertising revenues have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by several factors, including the changing landscape of television advertising spending and advertising market conditions.</p>
<p>We derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a continuing decline in advertising revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</p>
<p>Shifting consumer preferences toward streaming services and other digital products and the increasing number of entertainment choices has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced content viewership through traditional linear distribution models. This has changed the landscape of traditional television advertising spending, prompting advertisers to shift their strategies, and ultimately advertising spend, toward streaming services and other digital products to reach target audiences. In addition, a number of other streaming services with larger subscriber bases and greater household penetration have recently introduced ad-supported tiers. The increase of digital advertising available in the marketplace, due to both the introduction of ad-supported tiers in competing streaming services and the expansion of free ad-supported television ("FAST") products, has increased the competition we face for advertising expenditures for both our traditional linear networks and the ad-supported tiers in our streaming services, and also limited our ability to demand higher rates for our linear and digital advertising inventory or even the same rates that we previously charged for our advertising inventory prior to the surge in digital advertising. There can be no assurance that we can successfully navigate the evolving streaming and digital advertising market or that the advertising revenues we generate in that market will replace the declines in advertising revenues generated from our traditional linear business.</p>
<p>The advertising market is also sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. Financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where our content is distributed could adversely affect the spending priorities of our advertising partners who might reduce their spending, which could result in a decrease in advertising rates and volume and in our overall advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures, which could also have an adverse effect on our advertising revenues.</p>
<p>Our advertising revenues are also dependent on our ability to measure viewership and audience engagement across all platforms and in all geographic regions. Although audience measurement systems have evolved and improved to capture the viewership of programming across multiple platforms, they still do not fully capture all viewership across streaming and other digital platforms and advertisers may not be willing to pay advertising rates based on the viewership that is not being measured. In certain geographic regions, our ability to fully capture viewership information may be limited by local laws and regulations.</p>
<p>As further discussed in other parts of this Item 1a. Risk Factors, our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on our ability to compete in highly competitive, rapidly evolving industries, our ability to respond to changes in consumer behavior and our ability to consistently achieve audience acceptance of our content and brands.</p>
<h2>Changes in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.</h2>
<p>Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behavior and shifting content consumption patterns. The ways in which viewers consume content, and technology and distribution models in the media and entertainment industries, continue to evolve, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenues. Technological advancements have empowered consumers to seek more control over how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching target audiences. This trend has impacted certain traditional distribution models, as demonstrated by industry-wide declines in cable ratings, declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle, the development of alternative distribution platforms for content, and reduced theatergoing.</p>
<p>Declines in linear television viewership are expected to continue and possibly accelerate, which could adversely affect our advertising and distribution revenues. In order to respond to this decline, changing consumer behavior, increasing preferences to watch on demand, and changes in content distribution models in the media and entertainment industries, we have invested in, developed and launched streaming services including Max, HBO Max and discovery+. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs to develop and market our streaming services, including costs related to international expansion, technological enhancements, and subscriber acquisition. There can be no assurance, however, that consumers and advertisers will embrace our offerings, that subscribers will activate or renew a subscription, particularly given the significant number of streaming services in the marketplace, or that our DTC business will be as successful or as profitable as our traditional linear television business.</p>
<p>The film industry has also been impacted by shifting consumer preferences and technological innovation. While restrictions on theatergoing from the COVID-19 pandemic have largely lifted, in some markets, box office performance and movie theater attendance may be slower to rebound to pre-pandemic levels due to, among other things, consumer preferences for consuming movies at home, a vast library of which is available to them through one or more streaming subscriptions, and shorter theatrical release windows. As a response to changing consumer preferences and to return theater attendance towards pre-pandemic levels, film studios such as ours can seek to invest in creating compelling films and seek to promote events in connection with feature films in order to enhance the consumer's movie theater experience. If the film industry and exhibitors are unable to successfully create and market "event" films and ultimately evolve and enhance the movie theater experience in response to shifting consumer preferences, the profitability, financial condition and results of operations of our studios business may be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>Each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, and the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not ultimately predictable. Further, technology in the media and entertainment industries continues to evolve rapidly. For example, AI is a new technology for which the advantages and risks associated with its use in such industries are currently largely uncertain and unregulated. If we are not able to access our targeted audience with appealing category-specific content and adapt to new technologies, distribution methods, platforms and business models, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately a decline in the demand for our programming, which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues, materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>The success of our business depends on the acceptance of our content and brands by our U.S. and international viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile .</h2>
<p>The production and distribution of television programs, feature films, sports and news content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The appeal, success and performance of our content with consumers, as well as with third-party licensees and other distribution partners, are critical factors that can affect the revenue that we receive with respect to our content-related business. Our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general, in special interest groups, in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces. For example, generally, feature films that perform well upon initial release also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. Therefore, the underperformance of a feature film, especially an "event" film, upon its public release can result in lower-than-expected revenues for our business which could limit our ability to create future content. We need to invest substantial amounts in the production or acquisition and marketing of our television programs, feature films, sports and news content before we learn whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. Failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for our content may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<p>The commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace. For example, as some foreign film and filmmaking industries grow and the availability of popular local content rises, the demand from foreign audiences for American films may decrease, which could negatively impact our revenue. Other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, piracy, and our ability to develop strong brand awareness may also affect the audience demand for our content. Consequently, reduced public acceptance of our television programs, feature films, sports and news content or negative publicity regarding individuals or operations associated with our content or brands may decrease our audience share and customer/viewer reach and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>If our DTC products fail to attract and retain subscribers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.</h2>
<p>Our Max, HBO Max and discovery+ offerings are subscription-based streaming services and are among many such services in a crowded and highly competitive landscape. Their success and the success of other subscription-based streaming services we may offer in the future will be largely dependent on our ability to initially attract, and ultimately retain, subscribers. If we are unable to effectively market our DTC products or if consumers do not perceive the pricing and related features of our DTC products to be of value versus our competitors, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers. In particular, decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the markets where our DTC products are offered may reduce our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our services, which could have a negative impact on our business. Relatedly, a decrease in viewing subscribers on our advertising-supported DTC products could also have a negative impact on the rates we are able to charge advertisers for advertising-supported services. The ability to attract and retain subscribers will also depend in part on our ability to provide compelling content choices that are differentiated from that of our competitors and that are more attractive than other sources of entertainment that consumers could choose in their free time. Furthermore, our ability to provide a quality subscriber experience and our relative service levels, may also impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If existing subscribers, including those who receive subscriptions through wireless and broadband bundling arrangements with third parties or through wholesale arrangements with MVPDs, cancel or discontinue their subscriptions for any reason, including as a result of selecting an alternative wireless or broadband plan that does not bundle our products, canceling or discontinuing their MVPD subscription, or due to the availability of competing offerings that are perceived to offer greater value compared to our DTC products, our business may be adversely affected. We would need to add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel or discontinue their subscriptions and to grow our business. If we are unable to attract and retain subscribers and offset the losses of subscribers who cancel or discontinue their subscriptions to our DTC products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Failure to renew, renewal with less favorable terms, or termination of our content licenses and similar distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue.</h2>
<p>Because our content and pay-TV networks are licensed to and distributed through third parties, such as traditional television and pay-TV broadcasters (such as cable and satellite operators) and operators of digital platforms, which in turn make such content available, directly and indirectly, to consumers, we are dependent upon the maintenance of such licensing and distribution agreements with such third parties. These agreements generally provide for the scope of licensed rights, including geographic territory, exploitation rights, holdbacks and/or other restrictions, including exclusivity or non-exclusivity, window(s) of exploitation (including first and second pay-TV and free to air broadcast), for the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized programming packages), and for payment of a license fee to us based on a number of factors, including the scope of the rights granted, the popularity of the content (as measured in the case of films, for example, by box office performance for certain downstream exploitation) and the date of its first theatrical or pay-TV exhibition.</p>
<p>Our agreements generally have a limited term which varies by territory and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future or that they will be renewed on terms that are favorable to us. Whether or not a distributor is willing to renew an agreement on terms that are favorable to us may be dependent upon our decision to make our content available on both our linear networks and our streaming platforms. Failure to renew an agreement prior to its expiration could lead to service blackout, which could in turn affect both our revenues and our reputation with viewers.</p>
<p>While the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue (as further described elsewhere in this Item 1A), subscription-based revenue also represents a significant portion of our revenue. The license fees and other commercial terms that we receive are dependent, among other factors, on the acceptance and performance of our content with consumers. A reduction in the license fees that we receive or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks or a reduction in distributor penetration, or as a result of changes in consumer habits, could adversely affect our distribution revenue. Such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue. Changes in distribution strategy and variations on traditional theatrical distribution and other licensing models, such as shortening traditional windows, may also drive changes in the license fees that distributors and other downstream licensees in the value chain may be willing to pay for content, which may in turn negatively affect our revenue. As a result of industry consolidation, our distributors have become and may continue to become larger, and as a result have gained or could gain additional market power. Such consolidation gives these distributors leverage in negotiating their distribution agreements with us which could subject our affiliate fee revenue to reduction or discounts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.</p>
<p>In addition, content distribution and license agreements are complex and individually negotiated. For example, some of our distribution agreements contain "most favored nation" clauses, which typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors. If we were to disagree with one of the counterparties on the interpretation of a content distribution and license agreement, it could damage our relationship with that counterparty as well as materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>We invest significant resources to acquire and maintain licenses to produce sports programming and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in our efforts to obtain or maintain licenses to recurring sports events or recoup our investment when the content is distributed.</h2>
<p>We face significant competition to acquire and maintain licenses to sports programming, which leads to significant expenditure of funds and resources. As a result of an increasing number of market entrants in the programming space, we have seen upward pressure on programming costs in recent years, particularly in connection with the licensing and acquisition of sports content from third parties. We may also be impacted by such upward pressures driven by increasing investment in programming by competitors. In certain international markets, regulations concerning content quotas or content investment requirements may be a further factor driving increasing programming costs. In addition, businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations. If our distributors have to pay higher rates to other holders of sports broadcasting rights, it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for the distribution of our networks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors to obtain and/or maintain licenses to recurring sports events, or that increasing competition for programming licenses and regulatory review from competition authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</p>
<p>There can also be no assurance that we will recoup our investment in sports programming, including realizing any anticipated benefits of our joint ventures. The impact of these contracts on our results of operations over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets and subscription levels and rates for programming. Our success with sports programming is highly dependent on consumer acceptance of this content and the size of our viewing audience. If viewers do not find our sports programming content acceptable, we could see low viewership, which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Our businesses have been, and in the future may be, subject to labor disruption.</h2>
<p>We and some of our suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, announcers, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of our television programs, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take, and have taken, actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns, work stoppages, or the possibility of such actions, including the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and potential future strikes by other unions involved in development and production, have resulted in, and could in the future result in, delays in the production of, or the release of, our television programs, feature films, and interactive entertainment. For example, the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes caused delays in the production of our television programs and feature films and in the release of certain programming. The impact of these strike-related delays and other consequences of these strikes have continued, and are expected to continue to, impact our business even after the strikes were ultimately resolved.</p>
<p>If the media and entertainment industries experience prolonged strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages, we may be unable to produce, distribute or license programming, feature films, and interactive entertainment, which could result in reduced revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. See the discussion under "Business - Industry Trends" that appears above. In addition, the pausing and restarting of certain productions resulted in incremental costs, delayed the completion and release of some of our content (films, television programs, and licensed programs) and could cause an impairment of our investment in film, television programs, or licensed program rights if the incremental costs are significant or we are unable to efficiently complete the production of the film, television show or program or decide to abandon the production.</p>
<p>We may also enter into new collective bargaining agreements or renew collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms and incur higher costs as a result of prolonged strikes, work slowdowns, or work stoppages. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude us from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact our promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>We have recognized, and could continue to recognize, impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets .</h2>
<p>We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including the continued decline of traditional linear television viewership and linear ad revenues, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, underperformance of our content, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, including in connection with restructuring initiatives, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.</p>
<h2>We rely on platforms owned by our competitors for digital and linear distribution of our content .</h2>
<p>We rely on platforms owned by third parties, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming services, to make our content available to our subscribers and viewers. If these third parties do not continue to provide access to our service on their platforms or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in maintaining existing or creating new relationships with these third parties, our ability to retain subscribers and grow our business could be adversely impacted.</p>
<h2>Service disruptions or the failure of communications satellites or transmitter facilities we rely upon could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</h2>
<p>We rely on communications satellites and transmitter facilities and other technical infrastructure, including fiber, to transmit programming to affiliates and other distributors. Shutdowns of communications satellites and transmitter facilities or service disruptions will pose significant risks to our operations. Such disruptions may be caused by power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, war, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks or other technical facilities and services used to transmit programming, failure of service providers to meet contractual requirements, or other similar events. If a communications satellite or other transmission means (e.g., fiber) is not able to transmit our programming, or if any material component thereof fails or becomes inoperable, we may not be able to secure an alternative communications path in a timely manner because, among other factors, there are a limited number of service providers and other means available for the transmission of programming, and any alternatives may require lead time and additional technical resources and infrastructure to implement. If such an event were to occur, there could be a disruption in the delivery of our programming, which could harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Risks Related to Our Acquisition and Integration of the WarnerMedia Business</h2>
<p>We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs relating to the integration of the WarnerMedia business, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger because of difficulties related to integration and other challenges faced by the combined Company.</p>
<p>On April 8, 2022, we completed the Merger in which we acquired the business, operations and activities that constitute the WarnerMedia Business from AT&amp;T. We incurred significant costs following the closing of the Merger, including costs relating to organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities and other contract termination costs, which costs we believe were necessary to realize the anticipated cost synergies from the Merger. Additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in connection with the continued integration of the legacy business, operations and activities of Discovery prior to the Merger (the "Discovery Business") and the WarnerMedia Business, including due to the resources required for integration. The amount and timing of any such costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<p>Prior to the Merger, the Discovery Business and the WarnerMedia Business operated independently, and while we have spent the last 23 months since the closing of the Merger on integration activities, there can be no assurances that our businesses will ultimately be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of any or all anticipated financial, strategic or other benefits. If we are not able to successfully complete the integration of the Discovery Business and the WarnerMedia Business, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer than expected to be realized. Our integration efforts could result in a loss of key employees, loss of customers, business disruption or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger:</p>
<ul>
<li>· continuing and finalizing the integration of the Discovery Business and the WarnerMedia Business in the time frame currently anticipated;</li>
<li>· integrating the businesses' administrative, accounting and information technology infrastructure;</li>
<li>· continuing to align and expand the geographic footprint of the DTC products for global customers; and</li>
<li>· resolving potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the integration of the Discovery Business and the WarnerMedia Business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the integration is completed successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, following the Merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined Company increased significantly. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to manage this expanded business, which could pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of diverse, complex operations and associated increased costs. All of these factors could materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<p>We have been engaged in legal proceedings and disputes related to the Merger and could be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes related to the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<p>In connection with the Merger, multiple putative class action lawsuits relating to the Merger were filed on behalf of stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or certain of our directors and executive officers seeking damages and other relief, and we have been engaged in other disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. Additional lawsuits relating to the Merger, or disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, could arise in the future. The outcomes of Merger-related lawsuits and disputes are uncertain and could negatively and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in a lawsuit or dispute, defending against the claim or resolving the dispute could be time-consuming and costly and divert our management's attention and resources away from our business, which could negatively and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Risks Related to Domestic and Foreign Laws and Regulations; Other Risks Related to International Operations</h2>
<h2>Changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other risks related to international operations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.</h2>
<p>Programming services like ours, and the distributors of our services, including cable operators, satellite operators and other multi-channel video programming distributors, are regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC, as well as by state and local governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business. These obligations and regulations, among other things, require closed captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, require certain content providers to make available audio descriptions of programming for the visually impaired, limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown during programming aimed primarily at an audience of children aged 12 and under, and require the identification of (or the maintenance of lists of) sponsors of political advertising. See the discussion under "Business - Regulatory Matters" that appears above. The U.S. Congress, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), U.S. state legislatures, and the courts currently have under consideration, and may adopt or interpret in the future, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our U.S. media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate.</p>
<p>In addition, we distribute programming outside the U.S. As a result, our business is, and may increasingly be, subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;</li>
<li>· local regulatory requirements (and any changes to such requirements), including restrictions on content, censorship, imposition of local content quotas, local production levies and investment obligations, and restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership, outsourcing, consumer protection, targeted advertising, intellectual property and related rights, including copyright and rightsholder rights and remuneration;</li>
<li>· our ability to obtain the appropriate licenses and other regulatory approvals we need to distribute content in foreign countries as well as regulatory intervention on how we currently operate, including how we license and distribute content;</li>
<li>· differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property;</li>
<li>· foreign exchange regulations, or significant fluctuations in foreign currency value and foreign exchange rates, as further described below in this Item 1A;</li>
<li>· capital, currency exchange and central banking controls;</li>
<li>· the instability of foreign economies and governments;</li>
<li>· the potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, cyber-attacks or war, including the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East;</li>
<li>· anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;</li>
<li>· sanction laws and regulations such as those administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control that restrict our dealings with certain sanctioned countries, territories, individuals and entities; these laws and regulations are complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose additional prohibitions or compliance obligations on our dealings in certain countries and territories, including sanctions imposed on Russia and certain Ukrainian territories as well as sanctions imposed on China;</li>
<li>· challenges implementing effective controls to monitor business activities across our expanded international operations;</li>
<li>· foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations and changes in these laws and regulations; and</li>
<li>· shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming and consumption of entertainment content overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-U.S. sources as well as our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the U.S. We also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing regulatory, economic or political environment in the regions where we do business.</p>
<p>This is of particular concern in Poland, where we own and operate TVN, a portfolio of free-to-air and pay-TV lifestyle, entertainment, and news networks, which faces legislative and regulatory risk. In the past, said risk has manifested itself in draft legislation, now abandoned, which would have precluded non-EEA ownership of Polish national broadcasters, and in delays in renewing broadcast licenses. Such regulatory pressure on TVN and/or similar developments could, directly or indirectly, affect the future operations of our Polish media properties and/or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate in that market in the future.</p>
<p>The evolving regulatory environment in international markets may also impact strategy, costs and results of operations, including with respect to local programming levies and investment obligations, satisfaction of local content quotas, access to local production incentive schemes, and direct and indirect digital taxes or levies on internet-based programming services.</p>
<p>We are subject to domestic and international privacy and data protection laws, which impact our ability to collect, manage, and use personal information. Our efforts to comply with such laws, which are continually evolving, could impose costly obligations on us and generate additional regulatory and litigation risk.</p>
<p>We are subject to domestic and international laws associated with the acquisition, storage, disclosure, use and protection of personal data, including under the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, several U.S. federal and state privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the CCPA, and many other international laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are continually evolving and many more U.S. state and federal laws and international laws may pass this year and over the next few years. See the discussion above in "Business - Regulatory Matters". These evolving privacy, security, and data protection laws may require us to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures, and our actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims, regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties.</p>
<h2>Environmental, social and governance laws and regulations may adversely impact our businesses.</h2>
<p>U.S. state and federal regulators, international regulators, investors, consumers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance considerations. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including environmental sustainability and climate change, human capital management, and cybersecurity, are under consideration or have been adopted. Many such laws, including new greenhouse gas emission regulations that have already been adopted in the State of California and in the European Union and have been proposed in other jurisdictions, include specific, quantitative disclosures regarding our global operations, both upstream and downstream. These increased disclosure obligations have required and may continue to require us to implement new practices and reporting processes, and have created and may continue to create additional compliance risk. They may also result in increased costs relating to tracking, reporting and compliance.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have adopted several initiatives and programs focused on environmental, social and governance issues, which may not achieve their intended outcomes. If we are unable to meet our enterprise objectives, or live up to evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards for environmental, social and governance issues, or if we are perceived by consumers, stockholders or employees to have not responded appropriately with respect to these issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell our products and services, could be negatively impacted. If, as a result of their assessment of our performance on environmental, social, and governance matters, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. Providers of debt and equity financing may also consider our performance in these areas and the ratings of external firms (which we have limited ability to influence) in their decisions involving our Company, which could impact our cost of capital and adversely affect our business.</p>
<h2>Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions.</h2>
<p>We have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. The value of these foreign currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies. Adverse business performance and financial results from unforeseen changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions. We manage our exposure to foreign currency risk by entering into derivative instruments with counterparty banks, which exposes us to counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. This exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Increasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could increase our tax liability and adversely impact our business and results of operations.</h2>
<p>We continue to face the increasing complexity of operating a global business, and we are subject to ever-changing tax policy and regulations around the world. Many foreign jurisdictions are contemplating additional taxes and/or levies on over-the-top services, as well as on media advertising. Other changes in tax laws and the interpretations thereof could have a material impact on our tax liability. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions have increased scrutiny and have either changed, or plan to change, their international tax systems due to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations. These recommendations include, among other things, profit reallocation rules and a 15% global minimum corporate income tax rate. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are expected to introduce legislation, to implement these recommendations. The application of this legislation is evolving, and we continue to assess the potential impact on our future tax liability.</p>
<p>Additional complexity has also arisen with respect to state aid; i.e., state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between European member states. In recent years the European Commission has increased their scrutiny of state aid and has deviated from historical E.U. state aid practices. We receive material amounts of financial incentives for conducting our content production activities in various jurisdictions that offer such incentives. If the E.U. were to restrict our ability to receive these incentives, such restrictions could have a material impact on our results of operations.</p>
<h2>Risks Related to Our Financial, Capital and Corporate Structure</h2>
<h2>Forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgements and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.</h2>
<p>Given the dynamic nature of our business, the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, "Adjusted EBITDA"), free cash flow and subscriber growth, and other financial and operating data, may differ materially from actual results, including as a result of events outside of our control and other risks and uncertainties described herein. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.</p>
<h2>We have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur debt, and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and senior notes.</h2>
<p>Our consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2023 was $41,889 million, of which $1,780 million is current. In addition, we have the ability to draw down on a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course, which would have the effect of further increasing our debt to the extent drawn. We are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing debt agreements, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. This would have the effect of further increasing our leverage ratio.</p>
<p>Our loan agreements contain restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage ratio and other financial maintenance tests. These covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets, or to take advantage of other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of our significant indebtedness, our corporate or debt-specific credit rating could be downgraded, which may increase our borrowing costs or subject us to even more restrictive covenants when we incur new debt in the future, which could reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility.</p>
<p>If we are unable to effectively reduce and sustain our leverage ratio, it could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or to generate cash sufficient to pay the interest or principal, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs;</li>
<li>· increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and market conditions;</li>
<li>· limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;</li>
<li>· requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes such as capital expenditures, investments, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions;</li>
<li>· requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;</li>
<li>· limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and</li>
<li>· placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>We could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments.</h2>
<p>Our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, availability under our credit facilities or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. The ability of our subsidiaries, including WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc., Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., and Discovery Communications, LLC to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including restrictions under our credit facilities, to which they may be or may become subject. Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we were subject to U.S. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. The Company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.</p>
<p>Certain of our businesses are conducted through joint ventures or partnerships with one or more third parties, in which we share ownership, management and profits of the business operation to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Certain of our businesses are conducted through joint ventures or partnerships with one or more third parties, where we have varying degrees of ownership and influence. From time to time, we may disagree with our joint venture partners on the strategy or management of a joint venture business but may be constrained in our ability to make decisions unilaterally as a result of legal or contractual obligations to our joint venture partners, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our relationship with our third-party partners is an important factor in the success of any joint venture or partnership. If a partner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such joint venture or partnership.</p>
<p>We have directors that are also related persons of Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership ("Advance/Newhouse") and that overlap with those of Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty Media"), Liberty Global plc ("Liberty Global"), Qurate Retail Group f/k/a Liberty Interactive Corporation ("Qurate Retail"), Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband"), and Liberty Latin America Ltd ("LLA"), which may lead to conflicting interests for those directors or result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts.</p>
<p>Advance/Newhouse owns shares representing approximately 8% of our outstanding common stock. Our board of directors includes Steven A. Miron, the Chief Executive Officer of Advance/Newhouse and Steven O. Newhouse, Co-President of Advance Publications, Inc., which holds interests in Advance/Newhouse and Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter"). Pursuant to a consent agreement entered into between Advance/Newhouse and the Company in connection with the Merger, the Company designated Mr. Miron and Mr. Newhouse to our board of directors with terms ending in 2025. Mr. Miron is also a member of the board of directors of Charter, of which Liberty Broadband and Advance Publications, Inc. own equity interests.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. John C. Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and member of the board of directors of Qurate Retail, serves on our board of directors. Our board of directors also currently includes one other person who is currently a member of the board of directors of Liberty Global, and a member of the board of directors of LLA. The respective parent companies of Advance/Newhouse and of Liberty Media, Liberty Global, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband, and LLA (together, the "Liberty Entities") own interests in various U.S. and international media, communications and entertainment companies, such as Charter, that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer. We have no rights in respect of U.S. or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any Liberty Entities, and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders.</p>
<p>None of the Liberty Entities own any interest in us. Dr. Malone beneficially owns: shares of Liberty Media representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock, shares representing approximately 30% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Global, shares representing approximately 6% of the aggregate voting power of Qurate Retail, shares representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband and shares representing less than 1% of our outstanding common stock. Our other directors who are also directors of the Liberty Entities hold stock and stock-based compensation in the Liberty Entities and hold our stock and stock-based compensation.</p>
<p>These ownership interests and/or business positions could create conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us, Advance/Newhouse and/or the Liberty Entities. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or Advance/Newhouse and/or one or more of the Liberty Entities, on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.</p>
<p>The members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. Likewise, those persons who serve in similar capacities at Advance/Newhouse or a Liberty Entity have fiduciary duties to those companies. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies, and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest.</p>
<h2>It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.</h2>
<p>In connection with the Merger, we agreed with AT&amp;T that for a two-year period following the Merger, we would not, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, enter into any transaction or series of transactions as a result of which one or more persons would acquire an amount of stock of our Company that, when combined with certain other changes in ownership of our stock (including the Merger), would equal or exceed 45% of the outstanding stock of our Company. Further, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· authorizing the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;</li>
<li>· classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms until the election of directors at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;</li>
<li>· limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;</li>
<li>· prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;</li>
<li>· establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;</li>
<li>· the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, under our charter, we have not opted out of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and we are therefore governed by Section 203. Accordingly, it is expected that Section 203 will have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions that our board of directors does not approve in advance and that Section 203 may discourage takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of WBD capital stock.</p>
<p>These provisions are intended to protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. As noted above, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, if our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to us and our stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in WBD and the market price of WBD common stock could decrease.</p>
<h2>If Advance/Newhouse were to sell its shares following the exercise of its registration rights, it may cause a significant decline in our stock price, even if our business is doing well.</h2>
<p>Advance/Newhouse and Advance Newhouse Partnership ("ANP") have been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock now held or hereafter acquired by them. Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, including customary "blackout periods", Advance/Newhouse and ANP have the right to assign any or all of their registration rights to their affiliates and successors, as well as a specified family foundation. The shares held by Advance/Newhouse and ANP are registered for resale pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 filed April 22, 2022. Any future exercise of registration rights or sale of large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.</p>
<h2>General Risks</h2>
<h2>We face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.</h2>
<p>We and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production, distribution and broadcast of our programming, and our online, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information. In the ordinary course of our business, cyber criminals and other malicious actors consistently target us and our service providers. Our systems and our service providers' systems have been breached in the past due to cybersecurity attacks. These systems may continue to be breached in the future due to employee error or misconduct, system vulnerabilities, malicious code, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. The risk of cyberattacks may continue to increase as technologies evolve and cyber criminals conduct their attacks using more sophisticated methods, including those which use AI. The risk of cyberattacks has also increased and is expected to continue to increase in connection with geopolitical events and dynamics, including ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and tensions with Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and other states. State-sponsored parties or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyberattacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain disruptions, or carry out other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may adversely disrupt or degrade our operations and may result in data compromise. Cybersecurity threats originate from a wide variety of sources/malicious actors, including, but not limited to, persons who constitute an insider threat, who are involved with organized crime, or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data systems or that of our service providers, customers or clients through social engineering, phishing, mobile phone malware, account takeovers, SIM card swapping, or similar methods.</p>
<p>We have implemented processes, strategies and incident response plans designed to identify, assess and manage cyber risks and information security vulnerabilities (as further described in Item 1C. Cybersecurity). However, our procedures may not be sufficient to adequately mitigate the negative impacts of a cyber breach or adverse event. If our or our service providers' information security systems or data are compromised, such compromises could result in a disruption of services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.</p>
<h2>Theft of our intellectual property and unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibitions of our intellectual property may decrease revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.</h2>
<p>The success of our business depends in part on effective and deterrent laws efficiently implemented by law enforcement to enable our ability to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our content and brands. We are a global media and entertainment company, and piracy or other infringement of our intellectual property (including digital content, feature films, television programming, gaming, and other content), brands and other intellectual property has the potential to materially adversely affect us. Piracy is particularly prevalent in parts of the world that do not effectively enforce intellectual property rights and laws. Even in territories like the U.S. that have stronger intellectual property laws, legal frameworks that are unresponsive to modern realities, combined with the lack of effective technological prevention and enforcement measures, may impede our enforcement efforts. Our enforcement activities depend in part on third parties, including technology and platform providers, whose cooperation and effectiveness cannot be assured to any degree. In addition, technological advances that allow the almost instantaneous unauthorized copying and downloading of content into digital formats without any degradation of quality from the original facilitate the rapid creation, transmission, and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies. This is also true for broadcast signals, which can be retransmitted without any degradation of quality from the original via unauthorized services. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners' ability to maintain the exclusive control over their copyrighted material and thus the value of their property. The proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. For example, it may reduce the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content. We may also need to spend significant amounts of money on improvement of technological platform security and enforcement activities, including litigation, to protect our intellectual property rights. Further, new technologies such as generative AI and their impact on our intellectual property rights remain uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses or result in infringement claims against us.</p>
<p>Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign laws, the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, or the inability to negotiate license or distribution agreements with third parties, could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a global company, we are subject to laws in the U.S. and abroad, as well as trade agreements which may limit our ability to exploit our intellectual property. For example, in certain countries, including China, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year.</p>
<p>From time to time, third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property and may assert infringement claims against us, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations.</p>
<p>Our success depends on attracting, developing, motivating and retaining key employees and creative talent within our business. Significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention, or failure to adequately motivate or compensate employees or creative talent, could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.</p>
<p>Attracting, developing, motivating and retaining talented employees are essential to the successful delivery of our products and services and success in the marketplace. Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities, and the ability to attract and retain these talented employees and personalities is critical in the development and delivery of products and services, which is an integral component of our growth strategy. Competition for employees and personalities can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward our current employees, we may not be able to retain them. If we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, following the Merger, we have undertaken a number of restructuring and transformation initiatives, including headcount reduction. This headcount reduction and other restructuring initiatives could disrupt our operations, adversely impact employee morale and our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to retain existing employees and hire new employees in the future, distract management and harm our business overall.</p>
<p>In addition, we employ or contract with talent who may have loyal audiences. These individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences. If we fail to retain or attract key individuals or if our talent loses their current audience base or suffer negative publicity, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Global economic conditions and other global events may have an adverse effect on our business.</h2>
<p>Our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and levels of consumer discretionary spending. A downturn in global economic conditions may negatively affect our current and potential customers, particularly advertisers whose expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions, vendors and others with whom we do business and their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, inflationary conditions or an increase in price levels generally increases our content production costs and other costs of doing business, which could negatively affect our profitability. Further, a high interest rate environment, whether arising out of a policy response to inflationary conditions or otherwise, increases the costs of our securitization portfolio, which may also negatively affect our results of operations.</p>
<p>Decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the U.S. and other countries where our content is distributed may cause a decrease in cable television subscriptions, subscriptions to our DTC products, or movie theater attendance to view our feature films, among others, all of which may negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.</p>
<p>In addition, our business and operations has been, and in the future could be, disrupted or impacted by other global events, including political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, natural disasters such as earthquakes, or pandemics. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic had numerous effects on our business including a decrease in advertising revenues, a postponement of significant live events, and reduced movie theater attendance. Other global events in the future could disrupt our business and operations in unpredictable ways.</p>
<h2>The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile due, in part, to circumstances beyond our control.</h2>
<p>The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>· actual or anticipated variations in our financial and operating results;</li>
<li>· changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans;</li>
<li>· variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;</li>
<li>· market sentiment about our industry in general or our business in particular, including our level of debt, our leverage ratio, and our ability to effectively compete in the categories and industries in which we operate;</li>
<li>· the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors, or other industry participants;</li>
<li>· spending on domestic and foreign television and digital advertising;</li>
<li>· the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor;</li>
<li>· overall general market fluctuations and other events affecting the stock market generally; and</li>
<li>· the economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors described in this Item 1A.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact our business, including by limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion.</p>
<h2>Strategic transactions and acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.</h2>
<p>From time to time we may enter into strategic transactions, make investments or make acquisitions, such as the Merger. Our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of significant debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. We may also incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty integrating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, subscribers, affiliates and vendors, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or U.S. Department of Justice, may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any strategic transactions and significant acquisitions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.</p>
<h2>Our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans could subject us to liabilities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</h2>
<p>We contribute to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (the "multiemployer plans") under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of our union-represented employees which could subject us to liabilities in certain circumstances. The amount of funds we may be obligated to contribute to multiemployer plans in the future cannot be estimated, as these amounts are based on future levels of work of the union-represented employees covered by the multiemployer plans, investment returns and the funding status of such plans. As of December 31, 2023, we were an employer that provided more than 5% of total contributions to certain of the multiemployer plans in which we participate. If we choose to stop participating or substantially reduce participation in certain of these plans, we may be subject to a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by any other participating employer that lead to a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer plan may result in the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer plan being borne by its remaining participating employers, including us. To the extent a multiemployer plan is underfunded or in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply. We currently contribute to multiemployer plans that are underfunded, and, as such, under federal law we may be subject to substantial liabilities in the event of a complete or partial withdrawal from, or a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from, or termination of, such plans. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to liabilities in the future due to the foregoing or other circumstances that may arise in connection with these plans or that we can adequately mitigate these costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may be involved in a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations, litigation actions (asserted individually and/or on behalf of a class), and arbitration proceedings. We may be subject to a number of lawsuits both in the U.S. and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust, intellectual property, employment, wage and hour, consumer privacy, regulatory and tax proceedings, contractual and commercial disputes, and the production, distribution, and licensing of our content. We may also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, which may entail related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience. Even if we believe a claim is without merit, and/or we ultimately prevail, defending against the claim could be time-consuming and costly and divert our management's attention and resources away from our business.</p>
<p>In addition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all significant expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1C. Cybersecurity.</h2>
<p>We have a cybersecurity program to assess and manage risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data, networks and technology assets across WBD. Our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO") is responsible for cybersecurity risk oversight and oversees a global organization whose responsibilities include proactively managing and monitoring information and content security, cybersecurity risk, and processes to enable secure and resilient access to, and use of, WBD products and services. Since the closing of the Merger in 2022, we have continued to strengthen and enhance our cybersecurity program and integrate it into our overall risk management processes.</p>
<h2>Risk Management and Strategy</h2>
<p>We have a cybersecurity risk management strategy for safeguarding our digital assets that includes both technical and non-technical cybersecurity controls. Our multi-layered technical defense involves a series of protective measures across various levels of our technology environment. This includes fortifying our network perimeter through intrusion detection and prevention systems, securing individual devices with antivirus solutions and endpoint detection, implementing network security measures, and ensuring the resilience of applications. In addition to these technical security solutions, we also leverage non-technical methods, such as promoting a cybersecurity-conscious culture throughout WBD which includes mandatory annual cybersecurity training for all employees, a regular cadence of cybersecurity messaging to our employees, and frequent phishing simulations. Further, we engage independent third parties to conduct annual internal and external penetration testing and independent assessments of our cybersecurity risk management practices using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework and other leading industry practices as guidelines. We also engage an independent third party to conduct a biennial cybersecurity maturity assessment to evaluate the maturity of our entire cybersecurity program.</p>
<p>We also invest in cybersecurity incident detection and response. Our Cybersecurity Operations Center provides continuous threat monitoring and anomaly detection that is intended to prevent or minimize damage from a cybersecurity attack. We have a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan that establishes procedures, roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols for WBD executive management and technical staff in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We test the efficacy of the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan and assess our response capabilities by conducting annual tabletop exercises that simulate cybersecurity threat scenarios.</p>
<p>We have ongoing processes to identify and assess cybersecurity risks associated with current and prospective third-party service providers. These processes include a vendor cybersecurity compliance assessment at the time of onboarding, contract renewal and/or as needed in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting such third-party vendor. In addition, we require our providers to meet appropriate security requirements, controls and responsibilities and notify us in the event of a cybersecurity incident that impacts us.</p>
<p>We have established cybersecurity information sharing and collaboration practices with both government agencies and industry partners, which we believe enhances our overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>We have established a cybersecurity governance structure to engage appropriate stakeholders. Our CISO is informed about and monitors our prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation efforts related to cyber threats through regular communication and reporting from our information security team. Our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Legal Officer, our Chief Audit and Risk Officer and our Chief Information Officer also have input and involvement in our cybersecurity program. Our Board of Directors has an active role, as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing the Company's overall risk management, including cybersecurity risks. Our Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for cybersecurity and information technology risks to our Audit Committee and is regularly informed about such risks through committee reports and other presentations. Our Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses our cybersecurity risks and is updated by our CISO on how we identify, assess and mitigate those risks. Our Audit Committee receives quarterly updates from our CISO on our cybersecurity risk posture, the status of projects to strengthen and enhance our cybersecurity program, the evolving threat landscape, and cybersecurity incident reports and learnings. The Audit Committee also periodically devotes additional meeting time, as needed, to in-depth discussions on a particularly relevant cybersecurity topic or to education on developments in the realm of cybersecurity. In addition to the quarterly incident reports, cybersecurity incidents meeting pre-determined criteria are reported to the Audit Committee outside of regularly scheduled quarterly updates and to WBD executive management as needed. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for details on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we face.</p>
<p>Our CISO has over 30 years of expertise in global digital and information security, cybersecurity risk management, data privacy and compliance across diverse industries including media and entertainment, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and government defense sectors and holds multiple industry-recognized certifications including, among others, a Certificate of Cybersecurity Oversight from the National Association of Corporate Directors and a Certified Information Systems Security Professional certification.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. Properties.</h2>
<p>The Company's headquarters are located in New York City at 230 Park Ave. South. The Company owns and leases approximately 23 million square feet of offices; studios; technical, production and warehouse spaces; and other properties in numerous locations in the U.S. and around the world for its businesses.

<h2>ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual property, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. However, a determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. The Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for such matters until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is made and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.</p>
<p>Between September 23, 2022 and October 24, 2022, two purported class action lawsuits (Collinsville Police Pension Board v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08171; Todorovski v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09125) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints named Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., Discovery, Inc., David Zaslav, and Gunnar Wiedenfels as defendants. The complaints generally alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements in SEC filings and in certain public statements relating to the Merger, in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On November 4, 2022, the court consolidated the Collinsville and Todorovski complaints under case number 1:22-CV-8171, and on December 12, 2022, the court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Advance/Newhouse Partnership, Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership, Steven A. Miron, Robert J. Miron, and Steven O. Newhouse as defendants. The amended complaint asserted violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On February 5, 2024, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.</p>

<h2>PART II</h2>
<h2>ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.</h2>
<p>WBD common stock is listed and traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "WBD".</p>
<p>As of February 8, 2024, there were approximately 689,822record holders of WBD common stock. This amount does not include the number of shareholders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokerage houses or other institutions, but includes each such institution as one shareholder.</p>
<p>We have not paid any cash dividends on WBD common stock and we have no present intention to do so. Payment of cash dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors after consideration of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant factors such as our credit facility's restrictions on our ability to declare dividends in certain situations.</p>
<h2>Stock Performance Graph</h2>
<p>The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis, for (a) WBD common stock (which began trading on April 11, 2022) and Discovery Series A common stock, Series B convertible common stock, and Series C common stock (which ceased trading on April 8, 2022), (b) the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index ("S&amp;P 500 Index"), and (c) the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Media and Entertainment Industry Group Index ("S&amp;P 500 Media &amp; Entertainment Index") for the five years ended December 31, 2023. The graph assumes $100 was invested in each of Discovery Series A common stock, Series B convertible common stock, and Series C common stock, the S&amp;P 500 Index, and the S&amp;P 500 Media &amp; Entertainment Index on December 31, 2018, and that $100 was invested in WBD common stock on April 11, 2022, the date on which it began trading. Note that historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.</p>

<h2>ITEM 6. [Reserved].</h2>
<h2>ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</h2>
<p>Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments, critical accounting policies, and estimates that require significant judgment and thus have the most significant potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis is intended to better allow investors to view the company from management's perspective.</p>
<p>This section provides an analysis of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. A discussion of our results of operations and liquidity for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed on February 24, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at ir.wbd.com. The information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<h2>BUSINESS OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>On April 8, 2022, Discovery, a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear, free-to-air, and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements, and DTC subscription products, completed its Merger with the WM Business of AT&amp;T and changed its name from "Discovery, Inc." to "Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc." On April 11, 2022, our shares started trading on Nasdaq under the trading symbol WBD. (See Note 3 and Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery is a premier global media and entertainment company that provides audiences with a differentiated portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, streaming, and gaming. Some of our iconic brands and franchises include Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, DC, HBO, HBO Max, Max, discovery+, CNN, Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TNT Sports, TBS, TLC, OWN, Warner Bros. Games, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, Game of Thrones, and The Lord of the Rings. For a discussion of our global portfolio see our business overview set forth in Item 1, "Business" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p>In connection with the Merger, we have announced and taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. We finalized the framework supporting our ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives during the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. We expect that we will incur approximately $4.1 - $5.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges, of which we have incurred $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Of the total expected pre-tax restructuring charges, we expect total cash expenditures to be $1.0 - $1.5 billion. We incurred $0.5 billion of pre-tax restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to this plan. While our restructuring efforts are ongoing, the restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we classified our operations in three reportable segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Studios - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to our networks/DTC services as well as third parties, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.</li>
<li>· Networks - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.</li>
<li>· DTC - Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our segment presentation was aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments.</p>
<p>For further discussion of financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business, our content development activities, and revenues, see our business overview set forth in Item 1, "Business" and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>The discussion below compares our actual results for the year ended December 31, 2023 to our pro forma combined results for the year ended December 31, 2022, as if the Merger occurred on January 1, 2021. Management believes reviewing our pro forma combined operating results in addition to actual operating results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. Our Studios, Networks, DTC, Corporate, and inter-segment eliminations information is based on the historical operating results of the respective segments and include, where applicable, adjustments for (i) additional costs of revenues from the fair value step-up of film and television library, (ii) additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, (iii) additional depreciation expense from the fair value of property and equipment, (iv) transaction costs and other one-time non-recurring costs, (v) additional interest expense for borrowings related to the Merger and amortization associated with fair value adjustments of debt assumed, (vi) changes to align accounting policies, (vii) elimination of intercompany activity, and (viii) associated tax-related impacts of adjustments.</p>
<p>Adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the combined businesses since January 1, 2021 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company's future consolidated results of operations.</p>
<p>Actual amounts for the year ended December 31, 2022 include results of operations for Discovery for the entire period and WM for the period subsequent to the completion of the Merger on April 8, 2022.</p>
<h2>Foreign Exchange Impacting Comparability</h2>
<p>In addition to the Merger, the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-FX"), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p>
<p>The ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the "2023 Baseline Rate"), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2023 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p>

<h2>NM - Not meaningful</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion below through operating loss reflects the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 on a pro-forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenues, and selling, general and administrative expenses are substantially attributable to the Merger. The percent changes of line items below operating loss in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in U.S. dollars.</p>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>Distribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, DTH satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and DTC subscribers. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution rights to our networks from cable, DTH satellite, and telecommunication service providers. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. From time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates, which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years. In some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks.</p>
<p>Distribution revenue was flat in 2023, as declines in linear subscribers and DTC wholesale in the U.S. were offset by higher U.S. contractual affiliate rates, new DTC partnership launches, DTC price increases in the U.S., and inflationary impact in Argentina.</p>
<p>Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites), and sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, the stage of development of television markets, and the popularity of free-to-air television. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital platforms on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue decreased 13% in 2023, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, soft advertising markets in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, certain international markets, and the prior year broadcast of the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship, partially offset by higher Max U.S. engagement and ad-lite subscriber growth.</p>
<p>Content revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, SVOD and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.</p>
<p>Content revenue decreased 4% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower TV licensing revenue and the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, partially offset by higher games revenue due to the release of Hogwarts Legacy and higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie .</p>
<p>Other revenue primarily consists of studio production services and tours.</p>
<p>Other revenue increased 14% in 2023, primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023, continued strong attendance at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London and Hollywood, and services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports joint venture.</p>
<h2>Costs of Revenues</h2>
<p>Our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television/digital series, specials, films, and sporting events. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs.</p>
<p>Costs of revenues decreased 4% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower content expense at our Studios segment for television products and our DTC segment and lower sports networks content expense, due to the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe and our exit from AT&amp;T SportsNets, partially offset by higher games content expense.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy, and back office support fees.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 15% in 2023, primarily attributable to more efficient marketing-related spend and a reduction in personnel costs, partially offset by higher theatrical and games marketing expense.</p>
<h2>Depreciation and Amortization</h2>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization increased 10% in 2023, primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized using the sum of the months' digits method, which resulted in lower pro forma amortization in 2022.</p>
<h2>Restructuring and Other Charges</h2>
<p>In connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. Restructuring and other charges decreased 84% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower content impairments and other content development costs and write-offs, contract terminations, facility consolidation activities, organizational restructuring, and other charges. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Impairments and Loss on Dispositions</h2>
<p>Impairments and loss on dispositions was a $77 million and $117 million loss in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The loss in 2023 was primarily attributable to lease impairments and costs associated with our exit from AT&amp;T SportsNets. The loss in 2022 was primarily attributable to the write-down to the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, of the Ranch Lot and Knoxville office building and land in connection with the classification as assets held for sale. (See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Interest Expense, net</h2>
<p>Actual interest expense, net increased $444 million in 2023, primarily attributable to debt assumed as a result of the Merger. (See Note 11 and Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Loss from Equity Investees, net</h2>
<p>Actual losses from our equity method investees were $82 million and $160 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes are attributable to the Company's share of earnings and losses from its equity investees. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Other (Expense) Income, net</h2>
<p>The table below presents the details of other (expense) income, net (in millions).</p>

<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The following table reconciles our effective income tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate.</p>
<p>| | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 | Year Ended December 31, 2022 |

| Pre-tax income at U.S. federal statutory income tax rate | $ | (811) | | 21 | % | $ | (1,881) | 21 |
| State and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit | | (388) | 10 | | % | | (218) 3 | % |
| Effect of foreign operations | | 342 - | | (9) | % % | 246 | (3) (2) | % |
| Preferred stock conversion premium charge | | (9) | | - | % | (17) | - | 166 |
| Noncontrolling interest adjustment Other, net | | 82 | (2) | - | % | 41 | - | % |
| Income tax benefit | $ | (784) | 20 | | % | $ (1,663) | 19 | |</p>
<p>Income tax benefit was $(784) million and $(1,663) million, and the Company's effective tax rate was 20% and 19% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book loss and the effect of foreign operations, including taxation and allocation of income and losses across various foreign jurisdictions. These decreases were partially offset by a state uncertain tax benefit remeasurement following a multi-year tax audit agreement and a favorable state deferred tax adjustment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 was further offset by a one-time expense incurred in 2022 related to a preferred stock conversion transaction expense that was not deductible for tax purposes.</p>
<h2>Segment Results of Operations - 2023 vs. 2022</h2>
<p>The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:</p>
<ul>
<li>· employee share-based compensation;</li>
<li>· depreciation and amortization;</li>
<li>· restructuring and facility consolidation;</li>
<li>· certain impairment charges;</li>
<li>· gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;</li>
<li>· certain inter-segment eliminations;</li>
<li>· third-party transaction and integration costs;</li>
<li>· amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;</li>
<li>· amortization of capitalized interest for content; and</li>
<li>· other items impacting comparability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p>

<p>The discussion below reflects the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.</p>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>Content revenue decreased 13% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower TV licensing revenue, partially offset by higher games revenue due to the release of Hogwarts Legacy and higher theatrical film rental revenue due to the release of Barbie . TV licensing revenue decreased due to the timing of TV production, including the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, certain large TV licensing deals in the prior year, fewer series sold to our owned platforms, and fewer CW series.</p>
<p>Other revenue increased 13% in 2023, primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023 and continued strong attendance at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London and Hollywood, partially offset by lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.</p>
<h2>Costs of Revenues</h2>
<p>Costs of revenues decreased 16% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower television product content expense, including the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, partially offset by higher content expense for games and theatrical products commensurate with higher revenues.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16% in 2023, primarily attributable to higher theatrical marketing expense due to the increased quantity of films released and higher games marketing expense to support the release of Hogwarts Legacy . Adjusted EBITDA</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA decreased 21% in 2023.</p>

<p>The discussion below reflects the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.</p>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>Distribution revenue decreased 2% in 2023, primarily attributable to a decline in linear subscribers in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, lower sports related revenue due to our exit from AT&amp;T SportsNets and the TNT Sports Chile shift to DTC, partially offset by higher U.S. contractual affiliate rates and inflationary impact in Argentina.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue decreased 13% in 2023, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, soft linear advertising markets in the U.S., and to a lesser extent, certain international markets, as well as the impact of broadcast of the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship in 2022.</p>
<p>Content revenue decreased by 24% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower international sports sublicensing due to the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, and lower third-party content licensing deals in the U.S., partially offset by higher inter-segment licensing of content to DTC.</p>
<p>Other revenue increased 21% in 2023, primarily attributable to services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture.</p>
<h2>Costs of Revenues</h2>
<p>Costs of revenues decreased 7% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower sports content expense, including the prior year broadcast of the Olympics in Europe and the NCAA March Madness Final Four and Championship and our exit from AT&amp;T SportsNets, lower domestic general entertainment and news related expense, partially offset by unfavorable expenses from inflationary impact in Argentina and costs associated with the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower marketing and personnel expenses.</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% in 2023.</p>

<p>The discussion below reflects the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 on a pro forma combined basis, ex-FX, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted EBITDA are substantially attributable to the Merger.</p>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we had 97.7 million DTC subscribers (as defined under Item 1. "Business").</p>
<p>Distribution revenue increased 2% in 2023, primarily attributable to new partnership launches, price increases in the U.S. and most international markets, the launch of the Ultimate tier for Max in the U.S., and the TNT Sports Chile shift to DTC, partially offset by U.S. wholesale declines.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue increased 35% in 2023, primarily attributable to higher Max U.S. engagement and ad-lite subscriber growth.</p>
<p>Content revenue increased 17% in 2023, primarily attributable to a higher volume of licensing deals.</p>
<h2>Costs of Revenues</h2>
<p>Cost of revenues decreased 7% in 2023, primarily attributable to lower content expense and the shutdown of CNN+ in the prior year, partially offset by increased content licensing costs commensurate with higher content revenue. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 32% in 2023, primarily attributable to more efficient marketing-related spend.</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA increased $2,150 million in 2023.</p>

<p>Corporate operations primarily consist of executive management and administrative support services, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense, as well as substantially all of our share-based compensation and third-party transaction and integration costs.</p>
<p>As reported transaction and integration costs for 2022 included the impact of the issuance of additional shares of WBD common stock to Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership of $789 million upon the closing of the Merger. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA improved 20% in 2023, primarily attributable to reductions to personnel costs, lower technology-related operating expenses, and lower securitization expense.</p>

<p>Inter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and promotion activity between reportable segments. In our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution activities are in different segments. Inter-segment content transactions are presented "gross" (i.e. the segment producing and/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate "Eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment distributing the content, e.g. via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including "mark-ups" and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. The content amortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate "Eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<h2>Sources of Cash</h2>
<p>Historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During 2023, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had $3.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We are a well-known seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice, subject to market conditions. Access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. We have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program described below. We also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring program described below.</p>
<h2>· Debt</h2>
<h2>Senior Notes</h2>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued $1.5 billion of 6.412% fixed rate senior notes due March 2026. After March 2024, the senior notes are redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") and have the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility"). We may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed and repaid $5,207 million and $5,214 million, respectively, under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program.</p>
<h2>· Revolving Receivables Program</h2>
<p>We have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5,500 million of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. We service the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pay fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. As customers pay their balances, our available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically we transfer additional receivables into the program. In some cases, we may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. The outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was $5,200 million as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>· Accounts Receivable Factoring</h2>
<p>We have a factoring agreement to sell certain of our non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total trade accounts receivable sold under our factoring arrangement was $383 million.</p>
<h2>· Derivatives</h2>
<p>We received investing proceeds of $121 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Uses of Cash</h2>
<p>Our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel costs, costs to develop and market our streaming service Max, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes and term loan, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock.</p>
<h2>· Content Acquisition</h2>
<p>We plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights. Additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations" in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."</p>
<h2>· Debt</h2>
<h2>Term Loan</h2>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repaid $4.0 billion of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our term loan prior to the due date of April 2025.</p>
<p>Floating Rate Notes</p>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed a tender offer and purchased $460 million of aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes prior to the due date of March 2024.</p>
<p>Senior Notes</p>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased or repaid $2,420 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due in 2023 and 2024. In addition, we have $1,781 million of senior notes coming due in 2024.</p>
<p>We may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or purchase our other outstanding indebtedness through prepayments, redemptions, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such purchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and general market conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we purchase or exchange any of our debt and the size and timing of any such purchases or exchanges will be determined at our discretion.</p>
<h2>· Capital Expenditures</h2>
<p>We effected capital expenditures of $1,316 million in 2023, including amounts capitalized to support Max. In addition, we expect to continue toincur significant costs to develop and market Max.</p>
<h2>· Investments and Business Combinations</h2>
<p>Our uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We also provide funding to our investees from time to time. We contributed $112 million and $168 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for investments in and advances to our investees.</p>
<p>We previously held a 35% interest in BluTV, an SVOD platform entity and content distributor in Turkey that was accounted for as an equity method investment. In December 2023, we acquired the remaining 65% of BluTV for $50 million.</p>
<h2>· Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling Interest</h2>
<p>Due to business combinations, we also had redeemable equity balances of $165 million at December 31, 2023, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. In 2022, GoldenTree exercised its put right requiring us to purchase GoldenTree's noncontrolling interest. In 2023, we paid GoldenTree $49 million for the redemption of their noncontrolling interest. (See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests totaled $301 million and $300 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.</p>
<h2>· Common Stock Repurchases</h2>
<p>Historically, we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. In February 2020, our board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $2 billion upon completion of our existing $1 billion authorization announced in May 2019. Under the new stock repurchase authorization, management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases subject to market conditions and other factors. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) There were no common stock repurchases during 2023 or 2022.</p>
<h2>· Income Taxes and Interest</h2>
<p>We expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes.During 2023 and 2022, we made cash payments of $1,440 million and $1,027 million for income taxes and $2,237 million and $1,539 million for interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows</h2>
<p>The following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions).</p>
<p>| | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period | $ | 3,930 | 3,905 |
| Cash provided by operating activities | | 7,477 | 4,304 |
| Cash (used in) provided by investing activities | | (1,259) | 3,524 |
| Cash used in financing activities | | (5,837) | (7,742) |
| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | | 8 | (61) |
| Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | | 389 | 25 |
| Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period | $ | 4,319 | 3,930 |</p>
<h2>Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Cash provided by operating activities was $7,477 million and $4,304 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity.</p>
<h2>Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(1,259) million and $3,524 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to cash acquired from the Merger in the prior year, less proceeds received from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments and sale of investments, and increased purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash used in financing activities was $5,837 million and $7,742 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to less net debt activity during the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Capital Resources</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).</p>
<p>| | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Total Capacity | Outstanding Indebtedness | Unused Capacity |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 3,780 | - | 3,780 |
| Revolving credit facility and commercial paper program | 6,000 | - | 6,000 |
| Senior notes (a) | 43,955 | 43,955 | - |
| Total | 53,735 | 43,955 | 9,780 |</p>
<p>Interest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually, or quarterly. Our senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2023 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 8.30% and will mature between 2024 and 2062. (a)</p>
<p>We expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations, and availability under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.</p>
<p>The 2017 Tax Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.</p>
<h2>MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM KNOWN CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, our significant contractual and other obligations were as follows (in millions).</p>
<p>| | | Short-term | Long-term |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Long-term debt: | | | |
| Principal payments | 43,953 $ | 1,781 | $ 42,172 |
| Interest payments | 33,177 | 2,007 | 31,170 |
| Purchase obligations: | | | |
| Content | 24,072 | 7,077 | 16,995 |
| Other | 3,242 | 1,386 | 1,856 |
| Finance lease obligations | 296 | 85 | 211 |
| Operating lease obligations | 4,360 | 462 | 3,898 |
| Pension and other employee obligations | 1,526 | 531 | 995 |
| Total | 110,626 $ | 13,329 | $ 97,297 |</p>
<h2>Long-term Debt</h2>
<p>Principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. Interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual interest rates and maturity dates.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement and have the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Credit Facility. We may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. Additionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program. (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Purchase Obligations</h2>
<p>Content purchase obligations include commitments associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks and DTC services. Production and licensing contracts generally require the purchase of a specified number of episodes and payments during production or over the term of a license, and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. We expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.</p>
<p>Other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. Some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. Other purchase obligations also include future funding commitments to equity method investees. Although the Company had funding commitments to equity method investees as of December 31, 2023, the Company may also provide uncommitted additional funding to its equity method investments in the future. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>Content and other purchase obligations presented above exclude liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h2>Finance Lease Obligations</h2>
<p>We acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year finance lease arrangements. Principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements. Interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>Operating Lease Obligations</p>
<p>We obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. Most operating leases are not cancellable prior to their expiration. Payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Pension and Other Employee Obligations</h2>
<p>The Company participates in and/or sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. based employees and several U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are noncontributory ("Pension Plans"). The Company's Pension Plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>Contractual commitments include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our Pension Plans in 2024 and estimated benefit payments. Benefit payments have been estimated over a ten-year period. While benefit payments under the Pension Plans are expected to continue beyond 2033, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.</p>
<p>We are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount of any payments due to cash-settled share-based compensation awards. As of December 31, 2023, the current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $10 million. Unrecognized Tax Benefits</p>
<p>We are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our unrecognized tax benefits because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the amount and timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2,147 million as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Six Flags Guarantee</h2>
<p>In connection with WM's former investment in the Six Flags (as defined below) theme parks located in Georgia and Texas (collectively, the "Parks"), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the Company agreed to guarantee (the "Six Flags Guarantee") certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the Parks (the "Partnerships") for the benefit of the limited partners in such Partnerships, including, annual payments made to the Parks or to the limited partners and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the Partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The aggregate gross undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the Six Flags Guarantee over the remaining term (through 2028) are $521 million. To date, no payments have been made by us pursuant to the Six Flags Guarantee.</p>
<p>Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as Six Flags, Inc. and Premier Parks Inc.) ("Six Flags"), which has the controlling interest in the Parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the "Subordinated Indemnity Agreement"), to guarantee the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations when due and to indemnify the Company, among others, if the Six Flags Guarantee is called upon. If Six Flags defaults on its indemnification obligations, we have the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the Parks. Six Flags' obligations to us are further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by Six Flags.</p>
<p>Based on our evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the Guaranteed Obligations and the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, we are unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the Guaranteed Obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized as of December 31, 2023. Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial guarantee, we are unable to determine a current fair value for the Guaranteed Obligations and related Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.</p>
<h2>Other Contingent Commitments</h2>
<p>Other contingent commitments primarily include contingent payments for post-production term advance obligations on a certain co-financing arrangement, as well as operating lease commitment guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds, which generally support performance and payments for a wide range of global contingent and firm obligations, including insurance, litigation appeals, real estate leases, and other operational needs.</p>
<p>The Company's other contingent commitments at December 31, 2023 were $395 million, with $367 million estimated to be due in 2024. For other contingent commitments where payment obligations are outside our control, the timing of amounts represents the earliest period in which the payment could be requested. For the remaining other contingent commitments, the timing of the amounts presented represents when the maximum contingent commitment will expire but does not mean that we expect to incur an obligation to make any payments within that time period. In addition, these amounts do not reflect the effects of any indemnification rights we might possess.</p>
<h2>Put Rights</h2>
<p>We have granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries, but we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. We recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of $165 million. (See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Noncontrolling Interest</h2>
<p>The Food Network and Cooking Channel are operated and organized under the terms of the TV Food Network Partnership (the "Partnership"). We hold interests in the Partnership, along with another noncontrolling owner. The Partnership agreement specifies a dissolution date of December 31, 2024. If the term of the Partnership is not extended prior to that date, the Partnership agreement permits us, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business. If for some reason the Partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.</p>

<h2>RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily the Liberty Entities and our equity method investees. Information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>NEW ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</h2>
<p>We adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2023. Information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to uncertain tax positions, goodwill and intangible assets, content rights, consolidation and revenue recognition. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations.</p>
<p>The development and selection of these critical accounting estimates have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of the Company. We believe the following accounting estimates are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Uncertain Tax Positions</h2>
<p>We are subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, we engage in transactions or take filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. We establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless we determine that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. We include interest and where appropriate, potential penalties, as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information, the technical merits of the tax positions, and the accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained. This also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities. At December 31, 2023, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was $2,147 million, and it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of our uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $84 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, foreign judicial proceedings, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments.</p>
<h2>Goodwill and Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are Studios, Networks, and DTC.</p>
<p>We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. If we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method and the market multiple approach, which incorporates the use of EBITDA and revenue multiples based on market data. For the DCF method, we use projections specific to the reporting unit, as well as those based on general economic conditions, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires us to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long range plan, and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions.</p>
<h2>2023 Impairment Analysis</h2>
<p>As of October 1, 2023, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. The Studios reporting unit, which had headroom of 15%, and the Networks reporting unit, which had headroom of 5%, both had fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. During our annual impairment testing, we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption, the discount rate, and determined that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results. Additionally, the Company could reduce the terminal growth rate by 100 basis points, and the fair value of the reporting units would still exceed their carrying value. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of DCF and market valuation methodologies. Due to declining levels of global GDP growth, soft advertising markets in the U.S. associated with the Company's Networks reporting unit, content licensing trends in our Studios reporting unit, and execution risk associated with anticipated growth in the Company's DTC reporting unit, the Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for changes that could impact recoverability.</p>
<h2>Content Rights</h2>
<p>We capitalize the costs to produce or acquire feature films and television programs, and we amortize costs and test for impairment based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually, or as a group.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>For films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs (net of incentives) amortized and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as expense in a particular period are determined using the individual film forecast method. Under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film's or television program's revenues recognized for such period to the film's or television program's estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film's or television program's remaining life cycle).</p>
<p>For theatrical films, which are monetized on an individual basis, the process of estimating ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. Prior to the theatrical release of a film, our estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Subsequent to release, ultimate revenues are updated to reflect initial performance, which is often predictive of future performance.</p>
<p>For television programs that are monetized on an individual basis, ultimate revenues are estimated based on factors including the performance of similar programs in each applicable market, firm commitments in hand from customers that license the program in the future, and the popularity of the program in its initial markets.</p>
<p>For a film or television program that is predominantly monetized on its own but also monetized with other films and/or programs (such as on our DTC or linear services), we make a reasonable estimate of the value attributable to the film or program's exploitation while monetized with other films/programs, based on relative market rates, and expense such costs as the film or television program is exhibited.</p>
<p>Ultimates for content monetized on an individual basis are reviewed and updated (as applicable) on a quarterly basis; any adjustments are applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of the change.</p>
<p>For programs monetized as a group, including licensed programming, amortization expense for network programs is generally based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments for projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Streaming and premium pay-TV content amortization is based on estimated viewing patterns, as there are generally limited to no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets for premium pay-TV. As such, number of views is most representative of the use of the title.</p>
<p>Judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of our content assets that are predominantly monetized as a group. Critical assumptions include: (i) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or historical viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data, and (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model. We then consider the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. Content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks, the number of subscribers to our streaming services, and program usage. Accordingly, we review our estimates and planned usage at least quarterly and revise our assumptions if necessary.</p>
<h2>Consolidation</h2>
<p>We have ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. For each such entity, we evaluate our ownership, other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether we should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events. As part of its evaluation, we initially determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). Management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a VIE including whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties, (ii) the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity's operations, and (iii) the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses (or receive the expected returns) of the entity. If the entity is a VIE and if we have a variable interest in the entity, we use judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary and are thus required to consolidate the entity. In making this determination, we evaluate whether we or another party involved with the VIE (1) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.</p>
<p>If it is concluded that an entity is not a VIE, we consider our proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. A controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive third-party participation rights. Key factors we consider in determining the presence of substantive third-party participation rights include, but are not limited to, control of the board of directors, budget approval or veto rights, or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming, creative development, marketing, and selection of key personnel. Ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method.</p>
<p>We evaluated reconsideration events during the year ended December 31, 2023 and concluded there were no changes to our consolidation assessments.</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>As described in Note 2, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services or goods. Significant estimates and judgements are applied in determining the timing of revenue recognition for certain types of transactions, such as bundled arrangements for advertising sales and content licensing arrangements.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the U.S. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. These advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. For such contracts, judgment is required in measuring progress across our single performance obligation. Various factors such as pricing specific to the channel, daypart and targeted demographic, as well as audience guarantees, are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns. Revenues are ultimately recognized based on the guaranteed audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression.</p>
<p>Our content licensing arrangements often include fixed license fees from the licensing of feature films and television programs in the off-network cable, premium pay, syndication, streaming, and international television and streaming markets. For arrangements that include multiple titles and/or staggered availabilities across geographical regions, the availability of each title and/or each region is considered a separate performance obligation, and the fixed fee is allocated to each title/region based on comparable market rates and recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.</p>
<p>See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for details on significant risks that could impact our ability to successfully grow our cash flows. For an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.</h2>
<p>Our financial position, earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of investments. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.</p>
<h2>Interest Rates</h2>
<p>We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had access to a $6.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2023. We also have access to a commercial paper program, which had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2023. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on a floating rate based on the applicable currency of the borrowing plus a margin. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2026, with the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. As of December 31, 2023, we had $43.9 billion of fixed-rate senior notes, at par value.</p>
<p>Our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows. To achieve these objectives, we may enter into derivative instruments, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to benchmark interest rates in order to reduce the amount of interest paid, or to limit the impact of volatility in interest rates on future issuances of fixed rate debt. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our outstanding senior notes, including accrued interest, was $40.5 billion. The fair value of our long-term debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors. A change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt. The potential change in fair value of these senior notes from a 100 basis-point increase in quoted interest rates across all maturities, often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve, would be a decrease in fair value of approximately $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Foreign Currency Exchange Rates</h2>
<p>We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows, and future earnings. We operate from hubs in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia, with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or from our revolving credit facility. The earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely.</p>
<p>The functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' respective functional currencies ("nonfunctional currency risk"). Such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements, content arrangements, equipment and other vendor purchases, and intercompany transactions. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon period-end exchange rates. We also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, we will experience fluctuations in our revenues and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our net income, other comprehensive (loss) income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The majority of our foreign currency exposure is tied to Europe and Latin America. We may enter into derivative instruments that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue, the cost of producing or acquiring content, certain intercompany transactions, or in connection with forecasted business combinations. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows. Most of our non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of December 31, 2023. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Derivatives</h2>
<p>We may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not use derivatives unless there is an underlying exposure. While derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value, they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>
<h2>Market Values of Investments and Liabilities</h2>
<p>In addition to derivatives, we had investments in entities accounted for as equity method investments, equity investments, and other highly liquid instruments, such as money market funds and mutual funds, that are accounted for at fair value. We also have liabilities, such as deferred compensation, that are accounted for at fair value (See Note 10 and Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Investments in mutual funds include both fixed- and floating-rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed-rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from such investments may decrease in the future. Liabilities carried at fair value, such as deferred compensation, may experience capital gains that result in increased liabilities and expenses as the capital gains occur. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of these market value changes. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)</p>

<h2>MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING</h2>
<p>Management of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
<p>The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."</p>
<p>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.</p>
<h2>Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss) income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).</p>
<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.</p>
<h2>Basis for Opinions</h2>
<p>The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.</p>
<p>Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.</p>
<h2>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
<h2>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</h2>
<h2>Critical Audit Matters</h2>
<p>The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.</p>
<p>Goodwill Impairment Assessments - Networks and DTC Reporting Units</p>
<p>As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated goodwill balance was $35.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, and the goodwill associated with the Networks and DTC reporting units was $17.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Management evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. As of October 1, 2023, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. Management determines the fair value of the reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow and market valuation methodologies. Significant judgments and assumptions for the quantitative goodwill tests performed include discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including the revenue projections and profit margins.</p>
<p>The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments of the Networks and DTC reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Networks and DTC reporting units, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method related to revenue projections for the Networks and DTC reporting units and discount rate for the Networks reporting unit, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.</p>
<p>Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Networks and DTC reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of the Networks and DTC reporting units, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used by management, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue projections and discount rate. Evaluating management's assumptions related to revenue projections involved evaluating whether the assumptions are reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Networks and DTC reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.</p>

<h2>Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&amp;T</h2>
<p>On April 8, 2022 (the "Closing Date"), Discovery, Inc. ("Discovery") completed its merger (the "Merger") with the WarnerMedia business (the "WarnerMedia Business", "WM Business" or "WM") of AT&amp;T, Inc. ("AT&amp;T") and changed its name to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. On April 11, 2022, the Company's shares started trading on Nasdaq under the trading symbol WBD.</p>
<p>The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. (See Note 3 and Note 4). Prior to the Merger, WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. ("WMH") distributed $40.5 billion to AT&amp;T (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WM's retention of certain debt. Discovery transferred purchase consideration of $ 42.4 billion in equity to AT&amp;T shareholders in the Merger. In August 2022, the Company and AT&amp;T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2 billion payment from AT&amp;T in the third quarter of 2022 in lieu of adjusting the equity issued as purchase consideration in the Merger. AT&amp;T shareholders received shares of WBD Series A common stock ("WBD common stock") in the Merger representing 71% of the combined Company and the Company's pre-Merger shareholders continued to own 29% of the combined Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the WM Business for accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"); therefore, Discovery is considered the Company's predecessor and the historical financial statements of Discovery prior to April 8, 2022, are reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of the Company as of and for any periods prior to April 8, 2022 do not include the financial results of the WM Business and current and future results will not be comparable to results prior to the Merger.</p>
<h2>Labor Disruption</h2>
<p>The Writers Guild of America ("WGA") and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA") went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the AMPTP. The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023. As a result of the strikes, we paused certain theatrical and television productions, which resulted in delayed production spending amongst other impacts.</p>
<p>The strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. This included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company's ability to produce, license, and deliver content.</p>

<h2>Basis of Consolidation</h2>
<p>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained, including variable interest entities ("VIE") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. For each nonwholly owned subsidiary, the Company evaluates its ownership and other interests to determine whether it should consolidate the entity or account for its ownership interest as an unconsolidated investment. As part of its evaluation, the Company makes judgments in determining whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and is thus required to consolidate the entity. (See Note 10.) If it is concluded that an entity is not a VIE, then the Company considers its proportional voting interests in the entity. The Company consolidates majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. A controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of significant third-party participating rights. Ownership interests in entities for which the Company has significant influence that are not consolidated are accounted for as equity method investments.</p>
<p>Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
<p>Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include accounting for asset impairments, revenue recognition, estimated credit losses, content rights, leases, depreciation and amortization, the determination of ultimate revenues as they relate to amortization of capitalized content rights and accruals of participations and residuals, business combinations, share-based compensation, income taxes, other financial instruments, contingencies, estimated defined benefit plan liabilities, and the determination of whether the Company should consolidate certain entities.</p>
<h2>NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<h2>Foreign Currency</h2>
<p>The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates for revenues and expenses for the respective periods. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash flows from the Company's operations in foreign countries are generally translated at the weighted average rate for the respective periods.</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that it enters into transactions denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries' respective functional currencies. Transactions denominated in currencies other than subsidiaries' functional currencies are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements, content licensing arrangements, equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon period-end exchange rates. The Company also records realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency are included in other (expense) income, net.</p>
<h2>Cash and Cash Equivalents</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.</p>
<h2>Receivables</h2>
<p>The Company's accounts receivable balances and the related credit losses arise primarily from distribution, advertising and content revenue. Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers and are presented net of an estimate for credit losses. To assess collectability, the Company analyzes market trends, economic conditions, the aging of receivables and customer specific risks, and records a provision for estimated credit losses expected over the lifetime of receivables. The corresponding expense for the expected credit losses is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company does not require collateral with respect to trade receivables.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>Revolving Receivables Program</h2>
<p>The Company has a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5,500 million of certain receivables through its bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. The Company services the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pays fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. The agreement is a continuation of the agreement the WarnerMedia Business had in place prior to the Merger. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, the Company's available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically the Company transfers additional receivables into the program.</p>
<p>The gross value of the proceeds received results in derecognition of receivables and the obligations assumed are recorded at fair value. Cash received is reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The obligations assumed when proceeds are received relate to expected credit losses on sold receivables and estimated fee payments made on outstanding sold receivables already transferred. The obligations are subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated expected credit losses and interest rates, which are considered Level 3 fair value measurements since the inputs are unobservable (See Note 8). In some cases, the Company may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. Increases to accounts payable and subsequent payments are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.</p>
<h2>Accounts Receivable Factoring</h2>
<p>The Company has a factoring agreement to sell certain of its non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales in accordance with ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing", as its continuing involvement subsequent to the transfer is limited to providing certain servicing and collection actions on behalf of the purchaser of the designated trade accounts receivable. Proceeds from amounts factored are recorded as an increase to cash and cash equivalents and a reduction to receivables, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash received is also reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The accounts receivable factoring program is separate and distinct from the revolving receivables program.</p>
<h2>Film and Television Content Rights</h2>
<p>The Company capitalizes costs to produce television programs and feature films, including direct production costs, production overhead, interest, acquisition costs and development costs, as well as advances for live programming rights, such as sports. Costs to acquire licensed television series and feature film programming rights are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. Production incentives received from various jurisdictions where the Company produces content are recorded as a reduction to capitalized production costs. All capitalized content and prepaid license fees are classified as noncurrent assets, with the exception of content acquired with an initial license period of 12 months or less and prepaid sports rights expected to air within 12 months.</p>
<p>The Company groups its film and television content rights by monetization strategy: content that is predominantly monetized individually, and content that is predominantly monetized as a group.</p>
<h2>Content Monetized Individually</h2>
<p>For films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs (net of incentives) amortized and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as expense in a particular period are determined using the individual film forecast method. Under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film's or television program's revenues recognized for such period to the film's or television program's estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film's or television program's remaining life cycle).</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>The process of estimating ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. Prior to the theatrical release of a film, the Company's estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Subsequent to release, ultimate revenues are updated to reflect initial performance, which is often predictive of future performance. For a film or television program that is predominantly monetized on its own but also monetized with other films and/or programs (such as on the Company's DTC or linear services), the Company makes a reasonable estimate of the value attributable to the film or program's exploitation while monetized with other films/programs and expenses such costs as the film or television program is exhibited. For theatrical films, the period over which ultimate revenues from all applicable sources and exhibition windows are estimated does not exceed 10 years from the date of the film's initial release. For television programs, the ultimate period does not exceed10 years from delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For games, the ultimate period does not exceedtwo years from the date of the game's initial release. Ultimates for produced content monetized on an individual basis are reviewed and updated (as applicable) on a quarterly basis; any adjustments are applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of the change.</p>
<h2>Content Monetized as a Group</h2>
<p>For programs monetized as a group, including licensed programming, the Company's film groups are generally aligned along the Company's networks and digital content offerings, except for certain international territories wherein content assets are grouped by genre or territory. Adjustments for projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage. Streaming content and premium pay-TV amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are generally little to no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets. As such, number of views is most representative of the use of the title. Licensed rights to film and television programming are typically amortized over the useful life of the program's license period on a straight-line basis (or per-play basis, if greater, for certain programming on the Company's ad-supported networks), or accelerated basis for licensed original programs. The Company allocates the cost of multi-year sports programming arrangements over the contract period to each event or season based on its projected advertising revenue and an allocation of distribution revenue (estimated relative value). If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, the Company expenses the related contractual payments during the applicable season. Amortization of sports rights takes place when the content airs.</p>
<p>Quarterly, the Company prepares analyses to support its content amortization expense. Critical assumptions used in determining content amortization for programming predominantly monetized as a group include: (i) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or historical viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data, and (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model. The Company then considers the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. Content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving the Company's networks, the number of subscribers to its streaming services, and program usage. Accordingly, the Company reviews its estimates and planned usage at least quarterly and revises its assumptions if necessary. Any material adjustments from the Company's review of the amortization rates for assets in film groups are applied prospectively in the period of the change.</p>
<h2>Unamortized Film Costs Impairment Assessment</h2>
<p>Unamortized film costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a film (or television program) predominantly monetized on its own, or a film group, may be less than its unamortized costs. In addition, a change in the predominant monetization strategy is considered a triggering event for impairment testing before a title is accounted for as part of a film group. If the carrying value of an individual feature film or television program, or film group, exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded in the amount of the difference. For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the Company utilizes estimates including ultimate revenues and additional costs to be incurred (including exploitation and participation costs), in order to determine whether the carrying value of a film or television program is impaired.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>Game Development Costs</h2>
<p>Game development costs are expensed as incurred before the applicable game reaches technological feasibility, or for online hosted arrangements, before the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Commencing upon a title's release, the capitalized game development costs are amortized based on the proportion of the game's revenues recognized for such period to the game's total current and anticipated revenues, or, if greater, for non-hosted games, on a straight-line basis over the title's estimated economic life. Unamortized capitalized game production and development costs are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value and reported in "Film and television content rights and games" on the consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h2>Investments</h2>
<p>The Company holds investments in equity method investees and equity investments with and without readily determinable fair values. (See Note 10.)</p>
<h2>Equity Method Investments</h2>
<p>Investments in equity method investees are those for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary or the entity is not a VIE and the Company does not have a controlling financial interest. Under this method of accounting, the Company typically records its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of equity method investees in loss from equity investees, net and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Cash payments to equity method investees such as additional investments, loans and advances and expenses incurred on behalf of investees, as well as payments from equity method investees such as dividends, distributions and repayments of loans and advances are recorded as adjustments to investment balances.</p>
<p>The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. (See "Asset Impairment Analysis" below.) Equity Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values</p>
<p>Investments in entities or other securities in which the Company has no control or significant influence and is not the primary beneficiary, and have a readily determinable fair value are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are classified as equity securities or equity investments with readily determinable fair value. The investments are measured at fair value based on a quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs (Level 1). Gains and losses are recorded in other (expense) income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 10 and Note 18.)</p>
<h2>Equity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values</h2>
<p>Equity investments without readily determinable fair values include ownership rights that either (i) do not meet the definition of in-substance common stock or (ii) do not provide the Company with control or significant influence and these investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. Adjustments for observable price changes are recorded in other (expense) income, net. (See Note 10 and Note 18.)</p>
<h2>Property and Equipment</h2>
<p>Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. Internal use software costs are capitalized during the application development stage; software costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not enhance the use or extend the life of property and equipment are expensed as incurred. Depreciation for most property and equipment is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. (See Note 18.)</p>
<h2>Leases</h2>
<p>The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets are included in other noncurrent assets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net. Operating and finance lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption and leases with initial terms of one year or less are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>A rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable is used in arriving at the present value of lease payments. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement date for most of its leases. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's U.S. dollar denominated senior unsecured borrowing curves using public credit ratings adjusted down to a collateralized basis using a combination of recovery rate and credit notching approaches and translated into major contract currencies as applicable.</p>
<p>The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. The Company does not separate lease components from non-lease components across all lease categories. Instead, each separate lease component and non-lease component are accounted for as a single lease component. In addition, variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate are included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities at lease inception. All other variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, the Company recognizes interest expense on lease liabilities using the effective interest method and amortization of ROU assets on a straight-line basis.</p>
<h2>Defined Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. employees and several non-U.S. pension plans. Defined benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by the Company's actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.</p>
<h2>Asset Impairment Analysis</h2>
<h2>Goodwill</h2>
<p>Goodwill is allocated to the Company's reporting units, which are its operating segments or one level below its operating segments. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If the Company believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. The Company typically performs a quantitative impairment test every three years, irrespective of the outcome of the Company's qualitative assessment.</p>
<h2>Long-lived Assets</h2>
<p>Long-lived assets such as amortizing trademarks and trade names; affiliate, advertising, and subscriber relationships; franchises and other intangible assets; and property and equipment are not required to be tested for impairment annually, but rather whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If an impairment analysis is required, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company's intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.</p>
<ul>
<li>· If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the asset group's carrying value over its fair value, which is typically determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset group.</li>
<li>· If the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met, the impairment test involves comparing the asset's carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant judgments used for long-lived asset impairment assessments include identifying the appropriate asset groupings that represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent and primary assets within those groupings, determining whether events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and assumptions applied in determining fair value, which include reasonable discount rates, growth rates, market risk premiums and other assumptions about the economic environment.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>Equity Method Investments and Equity Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Value</h2>
<p>Equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Equity method investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary. The Company may estimate the fair value of its equity method investments by considering recent investee equity transactions, DCF analysis, recent operating results, comparable public company operating cash flow multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values. If the fair value of the investment has dropped below its carrying amount, management considers several factors when determining whether an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, such as the length of the time and the extent to which the estimated fair value or market value has been below the carrying value, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the investee, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and general market conditions. The estimation of fair value and whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred requires the application of significant judgment and future results may vary from current assumptions. If declines in the value of the equity method investments are determined to be other-than-temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period as a component of loss from equity investees, net on the consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. The Company performs a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if any observable price changes have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that an observable price change has occurred, a gain or loss is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value in the current period as a component of other (expense) income, net. (See Note 10.)</p>
<h2>Derivative Instruments</h2>
<p>The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and from market volatility related to certain investments measured at fair value. At the inception of a derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative based on the Company's intentions and expectations as to the likely effectiveness as a hedge (see Note 13), as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow hedge");</li>
<li>· a hedge of net investments in foreign operations ("net investment hedge");</li>
<li>· a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value hedge"); or</li>
<li>· an instrument with no hedging designation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cash Flow Hedges</h2>
<p>The Company may designate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate foreign currency risk arising from third-party revenue agreements, intercompany licensing agreements, production expenses and rebates, or to hedge the interest rate risk for certain senior notes and forecasted debt issuances. For instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the forward contract is recorded in other comprehensive loss and reclassified into the statements of operations in the same line item in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period as the hedged item affects earnings.</p>
<h2>Net Investment Hedges</h2>
<p>The Company may designate derivative instruments as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Company assesses the effectiveness of net investment hedges utilizing the spot-method. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as net investment hedges is initially recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive loss. While the change in fair value attributable to hedge effectiveness remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the net investment is sold or liquidated, the change in fair value attributable to components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (e.g., forward points, cross currency basis, etc.) is reflected as a component of interest expense, net in the current period.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Hedges</h2>
<p>The Company may designate derivative instruments as fair value hedges to mitigate the variability in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment. For those derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments, including offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items are recorded in the statements of operations in the same line item where the hedged risk occurs.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>No Hedging Designation</h2>
<p>The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. These instruments are intended to mitigate economic exposures due to exogenous events and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and from market volatility related to certain investments measured at fair value. The changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in the statements of operations in the same line item where the hedged risk occurs.</p>
<h2>Financial Statement Presentation</h2>
<p>Unsettled derivative contracts are recorded at their gross fair values on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the fair value that represents cash flows occurring within one year is classified as current, and the portion related to cash flows occurring beyond one year is classified as noncurrent.</p>
<p>Cash flows from designated derivative instruments used as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the cash flows of the hedged item. Cash flows from periodic settlement of interest on cross currency swaps and derivative contracts not designated as hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.</p>
<h2>Treasury Stock</h2>
<p>When stock is acquired for purposes other than formal or constructive retirement, the purchase price of the acquired stock is recorded in a separate treasury stock account, which is separately reported as a reduction of equity. Treasury stock held by Discovery prior to the Merger was not retired.</p>
<p>When stock is retired or purchased for formal or constructive retirement, the purchase price is initially recorded as a reduction to the par value of the shares repurchased, with any excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital related to the series of shares repurchased and any remaining excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. If the purchase price exceeds the amounts allocated to par value and additional paid-in capital related to the series of shares repurchased and retained earnings, the remainder is allocated to additional paid-in capital related to other series of shares.</p>
<p>To determine the cost of treasury stock that is either sold or reissued, the Company uses the last in, first out method. If the proceeds from the re-issuance of treasury stock are greater than the cost, the excess is recorded as additional paid-in capital. If the proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock are less than the cost, the excess cost first reduces any additional paid-in capital arising from previous treasury stock transactions for that class of stock, and any additional excess is recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods. Revenues do not include taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities such as sales tax and value-added tax. However, certain revenues include taxes that customers pay to taxing authorities on the Company's behalf, such as foreign withholding tax. Revenue recognition for each source of revenue is also based on the following policies.</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites). A substantial portion of the linear and digital advertising contracts in the U.S. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. On the linear platform, the Company provides a service to deliver an advertising campaign which is satisfied by the provision of a minimum number of advertising spots in exchange for a fixed fee over a contract period of one year or less. The Company delivers spots in accordance with these contracts during a variety of day parts and programs. In the agreements governing these advertising campaigns, the Company has also promised to deliver to its customers a guaranteed minimum number of viewers ("impressions") on a specific television network within a particular demographic (e.g. men aged 18-35). These advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. Revenues are recognized based on the guaranteed audience level multiplied by the average price per impression. The Company provides the advertiser with advertising until the guaranteed audience level is delivered, and invoiced advertising revenue receivables may exceed the value of the audience delivery. As such, revenues are deferred until the guaranteed audience level is delivered or the rights associated with the guarantee lapse, which is typically less than one year. Audience guarantees are initially developed internally, based on planned programming, historical audience levels, the success of pilot programs, and market trends. Actual audience and delivery information is published by independent ratings services.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>Digital advertising contracts typically contain promises to deliver guaranteed impressions in specific markets against a targeted demographic during a stipulated period of time. If the specified number of impressions is not delivered, the transaction price is reduced by the number of impressions not delivered multiplied by the contractually stated price per impression. Each promise is considered a separate performance obligation. For digital contracts with an audience guarantee, advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered. Actual audience delivery is typically reported by independent third parties.</p>
<p>For contracts without an audience guarantee, advertising revenues are recognized as each spot airs. The airing of individual spots without a guaranteed audience level are each distinct, individual performance obligations. The Company allocates the consideration to each spot based on its relative standalone selling price.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Distribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and DTC subscribers. Cable operators, DTH satellite operators and telecommunications service providers typically pay royalties via a per-subscriber fee for the right to distribute the Company's programming under the terms of distribution contracts. The majority of the Company's distribution fees are collected monthly throughout the year and distribution revenue is recognized over the term of the contracts based on contracted programming rates and reported subscriber levels. The amount of distribution fees due to the Company is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, the Company estimates the number of subscribers receiving the Company's programming to estimate royalty revenue. Historical adjustments to recorded estimates have not been material. Distribution revenue from fixed-fee contracts is recognized over the contract term based on the continuous delivery of the content to the affiliate. Any monetary incentives provided to distributors other than for distinct goods or services acquired at fair value are recognized as a reduction of revenue over the term.</p>
<p>Although the delivery of linear feeds and digital products, such as video-on-demand ("VOD") and authenticated TVE applications, are considered distinct performance obligations within a distribution arrangement, on-demand offerings generally match the programs that are airing on the linear network. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue for licensing arrangements as the license fee is earned and based on continuous delivery for fixed fee contracts.</p>
<p>Revenues associated with digital distribution arrangements are recognized when the Company transfers control of the programming and the rights to distribute the programming to the customer.</p>
<p>For DTC subscription services, the Company recognizes revenue as the service fee is earned over the subscription period.</p>

<p>Content revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, SVOD and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.</p>
<p>In general, fixed payments for the licensing of intellectual property are recognized as revenue at either the inception of the license term or as sales-based royalties as underlying sales occur if the intellectual property has significant standalone functionality ("functional IP," such as a produced film or television series), or over the corresponding license term if the licensee's ability to derive utility is dependent upon our continued support of the intellectual property throughout the license term ("symbolic IP," such as a character or a brand). Feature films may be produced or acquired for initial exhibition in theaters or direct release on our streaming service. Arrangements with theaters for exhibiting a film over a certain period are generally sales-based royalties and recorded as revenue as the underlying sales of the exhibitors occur.</p>
<p>Television programs are initially produced for broadcast networks, cable networks, premium pay services, first-run syndication or streaming services; revenues are recognized when the programs are available for use by the licensee. Fixed license fee revenues from the subsequent licensing of feature films and television programs in the off-network cable, premium pay, syndication, streaming and international television and streaming markets are also recognized upon availability of the content for use by the licensee. For television/streaming service licenses that include multiple titles with a fixed license fee across all titles, the availability of each title is considered a separate performance obligation, and the fixed fee is allocated to each title and recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, revenues are recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Certain arrangements (e.g., certain pay-TV/SVOD licenses) may include variable license fees that are based on sales of the licensee; these are recognized as revenue as the applicable underlying sales occur.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>Revenues from home entertainment sales of feature films and television programs in physical format are generally recognized at the later of the delivery date or the date when made widely available for sale or rental by retailers ("street date") based on gross sales less a provision for estimated returns, rebates and pricing allowances. The provision is based on management's estimates by analyzing vendor sales of our product, historical return trends, current economic conditions and changes in customer demand. Revenues from the licensing of television programs and films for electronic sell-through or video-on-demand are recognized when the product has been purchased by and made available to the consumer to either download or stream.</p>
<p>Revenues from sales of console games generally follow the same recognition methods as film and television programs in the home entertainment market. Revenues from digital sales of in-game purchases are assessed for deferral based on type of digital item purchased (e.g., consumable vs. durable) and estimated life of consumer game play and recognized upon purchase or over time as applicable.</p>
<p>Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property such as characters or brands (e.g., for merchandising or theme parks) are</p>
<p>recognized either straight-line over the license term or as the licensee's underlying product sales occur (sales-based royalty) depending on which method is most reflective of the earnings process.</p>
<h2>Contract Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<p>A contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company's right to bill and receive consideration and that right is conditioned upon something other than the passage of time. A contract liability, such as deferred revenue, is recorded when the Company has recorded billings in conjunction with its contractual right or when cash is received in advance of the Company's performance.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue primarily consists of TV/SVOD content licensing arrangements where the content has not yet been made available to the customer, consumer products and themed experience licensing arrangements with fixed payments, advance payment for DTC subscriptions, cash billed/received for television advertising in advance or for which the guaranteed viewership has not been provided, and advance fees related to the sublicensing of Olympic rights. The amounts classified as current are expected to be earned within the next year.</p>
<p>Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.</p>
<h2>Share-Based Compensation Expense</h2>
<p>The Company has incentive plans under which performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"), service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and stock options may be issued. In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). Share-based compensation expense for all awards is recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. Forfeitures for all awards are recognized as incurred. Excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options and vested RSUs, PRSUs and the ESPP are reported as cash inflows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.</p>
<h2>PRSUs</h2>
<p>PRSUs represent the contingent right to receive shares of WBD common stock, and vest overone year based on continuous service and the attainment of qualitative and quantitative performance targets. The number of PRSUs that vest typically ranges from0% to 100% based on a sliding scale where achieving or exceeding the performance target will result in 100% of the PRSUs vesting and achieving 70% or less of the target will result inno portion of the PRSUs vesting. Additionally, for certain PRSUs, the Company's Compensation Committee has discretion in determining the final number of units that vest, but may not increase the amount of any PRSU award above 100%. Upon vesting, each PRSU becomes convertible into one share of WBD common stock. Holders of PRSUs do not receive payments of dividends in the event the Company pays a cash dividend until such PRSUs are converted into shares of WBD common stock.</p>
<p>Compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the fair value of WBD common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for PRSUs that vest based on achieving subjective operating performance conditions or in situations where the executive may withhold taxes in excess of the maximum statutory requirement, is remeasured at fair value each reporting period until the award is settled. Compensation expense for all PRSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period only when it is probable that the operating performance conditions will be achieved. The Company records a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense for PRSUs if there is a change in the determination of the probability that the operating performance conditions will be achieved.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>RSUs</h2>
<p>RSUs represent the contingent right to receive shares of WBD common stock, substantially all of which vest ratably each year over periods ofthree to five years based on continuous service. Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognized ratably during the vesting period. RSU awards generally provide for accelerated vesting upon retirement or after reaching a specified age and years of service.</p>
<h2>Stock Options</h2>
<p>Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the closing market price of WBD common stock on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably overfour years from the grant date based on continuous service and expireseven years from the date of grant. Stock option awards generally provide for accelerated vesting upon retirement or after reaching a specified age and years of service. Compensation expense for stock options is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognized ratably during the vesting period.</p>
<p>The fair values of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Because the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of awards. For stock options the simplified method is utilized to calculate the expected term, since the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The simplified method considers the period from the date of grant through the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award. Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on WBD common stock and historical realized volatility of WBD and peer group common stock. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero because the Company has no history of paying cash dividends and no present intention to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award.</p>
<h2>ESPP</h2>
<p>The ESPP enables eligible employees to purchase shares of WBD common stock through payroll deductions or other permitted means. The Company recognizes the fair value of the discount associated with shares purchased under the ESPP as share-based compensation expense.</p>
<h2>Advertising Costs</h2>
<p>Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are presented in selling, general and administrative expenses.Advertising costs paid to third parties totaled $2,428 million, $2,519 million and $1,247 million for years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<h2>Collaborative Arrangements</h2>
<p>The Company's collaborative arrangements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain theatrical and television productions and an arrangement entered into with CBS Broadcasting, Inc. ("CBS") surrounding The National Collegiate Athletic Association (the "NCAA").</p>
<p>Co-financing arrangements generally represent the assignment of an economic interest in a film or television series to a producing partner. The Company generally records the amounts received for the assignment of an interest as a reduction of production cost, as the partner assumes the risk for their share of the film or series asset. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party partner owns an interest in the film or series; therefore, in each period, the Company reflects in the consolidated statements of operations either a charge or benefit to cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization to reflect the estimate of the third-party partner's interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film or series using the individual film forecast method, based on the terms of the arrangement. On occasion, the Company acquires the economic interest in a film from a producing partner; in this case, the Company capitalizes the acquisition cost as a content asset in film and television content rights and games and accounts for the third-party partner's share in applicable distribution results as described above.</p>
<p>The arrangement among Turner, CBS and the NCAA provides Turner and CBS with rights to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Tournament (the "NCAA Tournament") in the U.S. and its territories and possessions through 2032. The aggregate programming rights fee, production costs, advertising revenues and sponsorship revenues related to the NCAA Tournament and related programming are shared equally by the Company and CBS. However, if the amount paid for the programming rights fee and production costs in any given year exceeds advertising and sponsorship revenues for that year, CBS' share of such shortfall is limited to specified annual caps. The amounts recorded pursuant to the loss cap were not material during the year ended December 31, 2023. No amounts were recorded pursuant to the loss cap during the year ended December 31, 2022 since the 2022 cap was finalized prior to the Merger. In accounting for this arrangement, the Company records advertising revenue for the advertisements aired on its networks and amortizes its share of the programming rights fee based on the estimated relative value of each season over the term of the arrangement.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>For our collaborative arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain theatrical and television productions, net participation costs of$393 million and $276 million were recorded in cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.</p>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are measured using rates the Company expects to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, the Company's tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities.</p>
<p>In determining the Company's tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless the Company determines that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. The Company includes interest and where appropriate, penalties, as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations. There is significant judgment involved in determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on the Company's tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained, which involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities. The Company adjusts its tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.</p>
<p>In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a tax matters agreement ("TMA") with AT&amp;T. Pursuant to the TMA, the Company is responsible for tax liabilities of the WM Business related to the periods prior to AT&amp;T's ownership of the WM Business (June 14, 2018), and AT&amp;T is responsible for tax liabilities of the WM Business related to the period for which they owned the WM Business (June 15, 2018 through April 8, 2022). With respect to uncertain tax positions related to jurisdictions that have joint and several liability among members of the AT&amp;T tax filing group during the AT&amp;T ownership period, the Company has not recorded any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or indemnification receivables related to matters that were attributable to jurisdictions that have joint and several liability among members of the AT&amp;T filing group since AT&amp;T was determined to be the primary obligor.</p>
<h2>Concentrations Risk</h2>
<h2>Customers</h2>
<p>No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues for 2023, 2022 or 2021. The Company had two customers that represented more than 10% of distribution revenue in 2023, which in aggregate totaled24%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's trade receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk as the customers and markets in which the Company operates are varied and dispersed across many geographic areas.</p>
<h2>Financial Institutions</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.</p>
<h2>Counterparty Credit Risk</h2>
<p>The Company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties to outstanding derivative financial instruments will default on their obligations. The Company manages these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with outstanding derivative financial instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. The Company also has a limited number of arrangements where collateral is required to be posted in the instance that certain fair value thresholds are exceeded. The Company also has cash posted as collateral related to the Company's revolving receivables program. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had posted $539 million of collateral under these arrangements.</p>
<h2>Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements Adopted</h2>
<h2>Supplier Finance Programs</h2>
<p>In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for supplier finance program obligations. This guidance provides specific authoritative guidance for disclosure of supplier finance programs, including key terms of such programs, amounts outstanding, and where the obligations are presented in the statement of financial position. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2023 and has provided the required disclosures in Note 18.</p>
<h2>Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<h2>Segment Reporting</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its disclosures.</p>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for income taxes, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its disclosures.</p>
<h2>NOTE 3. EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE</h2>
<h2>Common Stock Issued in Connection with the WarnerMedia Merger</h2>
<p>In connection with the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A common stock, Discovery Series B convertible common stock, and Discovery Series C common stock, was reclassified and automatically converted into one share of WBD common stock, and each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A-1 convertible preferred stock ("Series A-1 Preferred Stock") and Series C-1 convertible preferred stock was reclassified and automatically converted into 13.1135 and 19.3648 shares of WBD common stock, respectively.</p>
<p>The Merger required the consent of Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership under Discovery's certificate of incorporation as the sole holder of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. In connection with Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership's entry into the consent agreement and related forfeiture of the significant rights attached to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in the reclassification of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into common stock, it received an increase to the number of shares of common stock of the Company into which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted. The impact of the issuance of such additional shares of common stock was $789 million and was recorded as a transaction expense in selling, general and administrative expense upon the closing of the Merger in the year ended December 31, 2022.</p>
<p>On April 8, 2022, the Company issued1.7 billion shares of WBD common stock as consideration paid for the acquisition of WM. (See Note 4).</p>
<h2>Repurchase Programs</h2>
<h2>Common Stock</h2>
<p>Under the Company's stock repurchase program, management is authorized to purchase shares of WBD common stock from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices, pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase agreements, or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors.</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>In February 2020, the Company's board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $2 billion upon completion of its existing $1 billion repurchase authorization announced in May 2019. All common stock repurchases, including prepaid common stock repurchase contracts, have been made through open market transactions and have been recorded as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. Over the life of the Company's repurchase programs and prior to the Merger and conversion of Discovery common stock to WBD common stock, the Company had repurchased 3 million and 229 million shares of Discovery Series A and Discovery Series C common stock, respectively, for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $8.2 billion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Earnings Per Share</h2>
<p>All share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification and automatic conversion into WBD common stock, except for Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which has not been recast because the conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into WBD common stock in connection with the Merger was considered a discrete event and treated prospectively.</p>

<h2>NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS</h2>
<h2>Acquisitions</h2>
<h2>WarnerMedia</h2>
<p>On April 8, 2022, the Company completed its Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&amp;T. The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro-rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of WM.</p>
<p>The Merger combined WM's content library and valuable intellectual property with Discovery's global footprint, collection of local-language content and deep regional expertise across more than220 countries and territories. The Company expects this broad, worldwide portfolio of brands, coupled with its DTC potential and the attractiveness of the combined assets, to result in increased market penetration globally. The Merger is also expected to create significant cost synergies for the Company.</p>
<h2>Purchase Price</h2>
<p>| | The following table summarizes the components of the aggregate purchase consideration paid to acquire WM (in millions). |
| --- | --- |
| Fair value of WBD common stock issued to AT&amp;T shareholders (1) | $ 42,309 |

| Settlement of preexisting relationships (3) | ( |
| Purchase consideration | $ 42,376 |</p>
<p>Balances reflect rounding of dollar and share amounts to millions, which may result in differences for recalculated standalone amounts compared with the amounts presented above. In August 2022, the Company and AT&amp;T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, which resulted in the Company receiving a $1.2 billion payment from AT&amp;T in the third quarter of 2022. AT&amp;T has raised certain claims associated with the merger that the Company believes are without merit.</p>
<h2>Purchase Price Allocation</h2>
<p>The Company applied the acquisition method of accounting to WM, whereby the excess of the fair value of the purchase price paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill reflects the assembled workforce of WM as well as revenue enhancements, cost savings and operating synergies that are expected to result from the Merger. The goodwill recorded as part of the Merger has been allocated to the Studios, Networks and DTC reportable segments in the amounts of $9,308 million, $7,074 million and $5,727 million, respectively, and is not deductible for tax purposes.</p>

<h2>NOTE 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS</h2>
<h2>Goodwill</h2>
<p>Changes in the carrying value of goodwill attributable to each business unit were as follows (in millions).</p>

<p>The carrying amount of goodwill at the Networks segment included accumulated impairments of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Studios and DTC segments didnot include any accumulated impairments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.</p>
<h2>Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following (in millions, except years).</p>
<p>| | | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |

| $^{ }$ Total | | $ 56,756 | (18,471) | $ 38,285 | $ 56,475 | (11,493) | $ 44,982 |</p>
<p>Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets reflects the pattern in which the assets' economic benefits are consumed over their estimated useful lives. For assets whose economic benefits are anticipated to be consumed evenly, a straight-line method is utilized. For assets in which the economic benefits are expected to be recognized unevenly over the useful life of the asset, an accelerated method such as the sum-of-the-months' digits method is utilized. Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $6.9 billion, $6.2 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<p>During 2023, the Company reassessed the useful lives and amortization methods for its linear networks and HBO trademarks and trade names, and its DC franchise, and concluded the pattern of amortization should be accelerated. Accordingly, the Company has changed the amortization method for these assets from the straight-line method to the sum-of-the-months' digits method. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Amortization expense relating to intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the next five years and thereafter is estimated to be as follows (in millions).</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Thereafter |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amortization expense | 5,757 | 4,245 | 3,122 | 2,369 | 1,782 | 21,010 |</p>
<h2>Impairment Analysis</h2>
<p>Significant judgments and assumptions for all quantitative goodwill tests performed include discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins.</p>
<h2>2023 Impairment Analysis</h2>
<p>As of October 1, 2023, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. The Studios reporting unit, which had headroom of 15%, and the Networks reporting unit, which had headroom of 5%, both had fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of DCF and market valuation methodologies. Due to declining levels of global GDP growth, soft advertising markets in the U.S. associated with the Company's Networks reporting unit, content licensing trends in our Studios reporting unit, and execution risk associated with anticipated growth in the Company's DTC reporting unit, the Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for changes that could impact recoverability.</p>
<h2>2022 Impairment Analysis</h2>
<p>For the 2022 annual impairment test, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consistent with the Company's accounting policy. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded.</p>
<h2>2021 Impairment Analysis</h2>
<p>For the 2021 annual impairment test, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values, therefore, no quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was performed.</p>
<h2>NOTE 6. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES</h2>
<p>In connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company.

<h2>Contract Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<p>The following table presents contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets (in millions).</p>

| Contract liabilities | Other noncurrent liabilities | 160 | 361 |</p>
<p>The change in deferred revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflects cash payments received or contracted billings recorded for which the performance obligations were not satisfied prior to the end of the period, partially offset by $ 1,354 million of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021 was $411 million. Contract assets were not material as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.</p>
<h2>Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations</h2>
<p>Most of the Company's distribution contracts are licenses of functional intellectual property where revenue is derived from royalty-based arrangements, for which revenues are recorded as a function of royalties earned to date instead of estimating incremental royalty contract revenue. However, there are certain other distribution arrangements that are fixed price or contain minimum guarantees that extend beyond one year. The Company recognizes revenue for fixed fee distribution contracts on a monthly basis based on minimum monthly fees by calculating one twelfth of annual license fees specified in its distribution contracts, or based on the pro-rata fees earned calculated on the license fees specified in the distribution contract.</p>
<p>The Company's content licensing contracts and sports sublicensing deals are licenses of functional intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Company's brand licensing contracts are licenses of symbolic intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Company's advertising contracts are principally generated from the sale of advertising campaigns comprised of multiple commercial units. In contracts with guaranteed impressions, we have identified the overall advertising campaign as the performance obligation to be satisfied over time, and impressions delivered against the satisfaction of our guarantee as the measure of progress. Certain of these arrangements extend beyond one year.</p>
<p>The following table presents a summary of remaining performance obligations by contract type (in millions).</p>
<p>| Contract Type | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution - fixed price or minimum guarantee | $ | 3,513 | Through 2031 |

| Advertising | | 892 | Through 2027 |
| Total | $ | 12,030 | |</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>The value of unsatisfied performance obligations disclosed above does not include: (i) contracts involving variable consideration for which revenues are recognized in accordance with the sales or usage-based royalty exception, and (ii) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, such as most advertising contracts; however for content licensing revenues, including revenues associated with the licensing of theatrical and television product for television and streaming services, the Company has included all contracts regardless of duration.</p>
<h2>NOTE 8. SALES OF RECEIVABLES</h2>
<h2>Revolving Receivables Program</h2>
<p>During 2023, the Company amended its revolving receivables program to reduce the facility limit to $5,500 million and extend the program to August 2024. The Company's bankruptcy-remote consolidated subsidiary held $3,088 million of pledged receivables as of December 31, 2023 in connection with the Company's revolving receivables program. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $79 million and $256 million, respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses from the revolving receivables program in the consolidated statements of operations (net of non-designated derivatives in 2023).

<h2>Equity Method Investments</h2>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with British Telecommunications Plc ("BT") to form a 50:50 joint venture to create a new premium sports offering for the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Company has determined the joint venture is a VIE and accounts for its investment in the joint venture as an equity method investment. Additionally, the Company has a call option to obtain the remaining 50% equity interest in September 2024 and September 2026, at the then fair market value plus the expected earnings that BT would have received in the two years following the call option. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the joint venture was $102 million.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure for all its unconsolidated VIEs, including the investment carrying values and unfunded contractual commitments made on behalf of VIEs, was approximately $ 734 million. The Company's maximum estimated exposure excludes the non-contractual future funding of VIEs. The aggregate carrying values of these VIE investments were $697 million and $720 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognized its portion of VIE operating results with losses of $75 million, $87 million, and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in loss from equity investees, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<h2>Equity Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Values Assessed Under the Measurement Alternative</h2>
<p>During 2023, the Company concluded that its other equity method investments without readily determinable fair values had decreased $73 million in fair value as a result of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. The decrease in fair value as a result of observable price change is recorded in other (expense) income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 18.) As of December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded cumulative impairments of $238 million for its equity method investments without readily determinable fair values.</p>

<h2>NOTE 13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</h2>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate market risk and interest rate fluctuations. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, fixed-to-fixed currency swaps, total return swaps and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency, market value and interest rate exposures. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings volatility by offsetting gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. The Company does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.</p>
<p>There were no amounts eligible to be offset under master netting agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was determined using a market-based approach (Level 2). The Company's derivative financial instruments were reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions).</p>

<h2>Derivatives Designated for Hedge Accounting</h2>
<h2>Cash Flow Hedges</h2>
<p>The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk related to revenues, production rebates and production expenses. As such, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this risk. These cash flow hedges are carried at fair market value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using the spot method, with fair market value changes recorded in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. Excluded components, including forward points, are included in current earnings.</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk associated with its British Pound Sterling denominated debt and executed a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap in 2022 to mitigate this risk. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company unwound the cross-currency swaps related to its Sterling debt and recognized a gain of $76 million as an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The Sterling debt was subsequently re-designated as a net investment hedge effective May 2023.</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with future issuances of debt and unwound the forward starting swap derivatives designated as hedging instruments to mitigate this risk in 2022. The realized gain from these derivatives will remain in other comprehensive loss until the debt is issued during the hedging window, which extends through 2025, and interest payments are made.</p>
<p>The following table presents the pretax impact of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on income and other comprehensive loss (in millions).</p>
<p>| | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| Gains (losses) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss: | | | |
| Foreign exchange - derivative adjustments | 23 | 7 | 57 |
| Interest rate - derivative adjustments | - | - | 112 |
| Gains (losses) reclassified into income from accumulated other comprehensive loss: | | | |
| Foreign exchange - distribution revenue | (5) | (1) | 4 |
| Foreign exchange - advertising revenue | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Foreign exchange - costs of revenues | 3 | 25 | - |

| Interest rate - interest expense, net | (1) | (2) | (2) |
| Interest rate - other (expense) income, net | 1 | - | - |</p>
<p>If current fair values of designated cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2023 remained static over the next twelve months, the amount the Company would reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income in the next twelve months would not be material for the current fiscal year. The maximum length of time the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 32 years.</p>
<h2>Net Investment Hedges</h2>
<p>The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities and uses fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps to mitigate this risk. During the year ended December 31, 2023, to mitigate the risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities, the Company re-designated its Sterling denominated debt due in 2024 as a net investment hedge after the unwind of the cash flow hedge previously noted.</p>
<p>The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk stemming from foreign denominated debt. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company settled its Euro denominated debt that was acquired in connection with the Merger and was designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.</p>

<h2>Fair Value Hedges</h2>
<p>During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued $1.5 billion of 6.412% fixed rate senior notes due March 2026. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to allow the Company to mitigate the variability in the fair value of its senior notes due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate.

<h2>Derivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting</h2>
<p>The Company has deferred compensation plans that have risk related to the fair market value gains and losses on investments and has entered into total return swaps to mitigate this risk. The gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the deferred compensation investment gains and losses.</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to risk of secured overnight financing rate changes in connection with securitization interest paid on the receivables securitization program. To mitigate this risk, the Company entered into and unwound and settled $ 6.0 billion notional of non-designated interest rate swaps for a total realized gain of $63 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting securitization interest expense.</p>
<p>Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated as production spend occurs or when rebate receivables are recognized. After de-designation, gains and losses on these derivatives directly impact earnings in the same line as the hedged risk.</p>

<h2>NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified in the following three categories:</p>
<p>Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.</p>
<p>Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.</p>
<p>Level 3 - Valuations derived from techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.</p>

<p>Equity securities include money market funds, time deposits, investments in mutual funds held in separate trusts, which are owned as part of the Company's supplemental retirement plans, and company-owned life insurance contracts. (See Note 17.) The fair value of the deferred compensation plan liability was determined based on the fair value of the related investments elected by employees. Company-owned life insurance contracts are recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value (Level 2).</p>
<p>In addition to the financial instruments listed in the tables above, the Company holds other financial instruments, including cash deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, term loans, and senior notes. The carrying values for such financial instruments, other than the senior notes, each approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding senior notes, including accrued interest, using quoted prices from over-the-counter markets, considered Level 2 inputs, was $40.5 billion and $38.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.</p>

<p>Income tax benefit was $(784) million and $(1,663) million, and the Company's effective tax rate was20% and 19% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book loss and the effect of foreign operations, including taxation and allocation of income and losses across various foreign jurisdictions. These decreases were partially offset by a state uncertain tax benefit remeasurement following a multi-year tax audit agreement and a favorable state deferred tax adjustment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 was further offset by a one-time expense incurred in 2022 related to a preferred stock conversion transaction expense that was not deductible for tax purposes.

<p>The balances as of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 included $2,147 million, $1,929 million, and $420 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Company's income tax expense and effective tax rate after giving effect to interest deductions and offsetting benefits from other tax jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for its 2012 to 2019 consolidated federal income tax returns. It is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audit by any jurisdiction for years prior to 2008. Adjustments that arose from the completion of audits for certain tax years have been included in the change in uncertain tax positions in the table above.</p>
<p>It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company's uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $ 84 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, foreign judicial proceedings, lapses of statutes of limitations, or regulatory developments.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company had accrued approximately $571 million, $413 million, and $60 million, respectively, of total interest and penalties payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The increase in the accrual for interest and penalties payable at December 31, 2023 includes interest and penalty accruals recorded in 2023 through purchase price accounting related to the Merger. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.</p>
<p>The 2017 Tax Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.</p>
<h2>NOTE 17. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS</h2>
<p>The Company has defined contribution, defined benefit, and other savings plans for the benefit of its employees that meet eligibility requirements.</p>
<h2>Defined Contribution Plans</h2>
<p>Eligible employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, which may be subject to certain statutory limitations. For these plans, the Company also makes contributions, including discretionary contributions, subject to plan provisions, which vest immediately. The Company made total contributions of $210 million, $188 million, and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company's contributions were recorded in cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>Executive Deferred Compensation Plans</h2>
<p>The Company has deferred compensation plans through which certain senior-level employees may elect to defer a portion of their eligible compensation. Distributions from the deferred compensation plans are generally made following separation from service or other events as specified in the plan. In certain plans, the Company may make discretionary contributions to employee accounts. While these plans are unfunded, the Company has established separate rabbi trusts used to provide for certain of these benefits. The accounts of the separate rabbi trusts are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The investments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred compensation obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The values of the investments and deferred compensation obligation are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the investments are included as a component of other (expense) income, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 14 and Note 18.)</p>
<h2>Multiemployer Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>The Company contributes to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain of our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability; and (iii) actions taken by a participating employer that lead to a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer pension plan may result in the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer pension plan being borne by its remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health and welfare benefit plans (in millions).</p>
<p>| | Year Ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 |
| Pension benefits | 128 | 112 |
| Health and welfare benefits | 153 | 182 |
| Total contributions | 281 | 294 |</p>
<p>Since these plans were acquired as part of the Merger, there wereno contributions for the year ended December 31, 2021.</p>
<h2>Defined Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>The Company participates in and/or sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. based employees and several U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are noncontributory. The Company's pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans.</p>
<p>The Company also holds net assets and net liabilities on behalf of other U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. The plan provisions vary by plan and by country. Some of these plans are unfunded and all are noncontributory. Assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets, and liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>Discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels, and mortality rates are key assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation.The table below describes how the assumptions are determined.</p>
<p>| Assumption | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Discount rate | Based on a bond portfolio approach that includes high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the Company's expected benefit payments from the plans. |
| Long-term rate of return on plan assets | Based on the weighted-average expected rate of return and capital market forecasts for each asset class employed and also considers the Company's historical compounded return on plan assets for 10 and 15-year periods. |
| Increase in compensation levels | Based on past experience and the near-term outlook. |
| Mortality | Various mortality tables adjusted and projected using mortality improvement rates. |</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>Net Periodic Pension Cost</h2>
<p>Expense recognized for the pension plans is based upon actuarial valuations. Inherent in those valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and, where applicable, expected returns on assets. The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is recorded in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, while the remaining components are recorded in other (expense) income, net. Net periodic pension cost was not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.</p>

<h2>Plan Assets</h2>
<p>The Company's investment policy is to maximize the total rate of return on plan assets to meet the long-term funding obligations of the pension plans. There are no restrictions on the types of investments held in the pension plans, which are invested using a combination of active management and passive investment strategies. Risk is controlled through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles, and securities. Risk is further controlled both at the manager and asset class levels by assigning return targets and evaluating performance against these targets.

<h2>Assets Held for Sale</h2>
<p>In 2022, the Company classified its Ranch Lot and Knoxville office building and land as assets held for sale. The Company reclassified $ 209 million to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet during 2022 and stopped recording depreciation on the assets. The Knoxville office building and land and the Ranch Lot were sold during 2023. The Burbank Studios Lot was purchased during 2023 in exchange for the Ranch Lot and cash.</p>
<h2>Supplier Finance Programs</h2>
<p>Consistent with customary industry practice, the Company generally pays certain content producers at or near the completion of the production cycle. In these arrangements, content producers may earn fees upon contractual milestones to be invoiced at or near completion of production. In these instances, the Company accrues the content in progress in accordance with the contractual milestones. Certain of the Company's content producers sell their related receivables to a bank intermediary who provides payments that coincide with these contractual production milestones upon confirmation with the Company of our obligation to the content producer. This confirmation does not involve a security interest in the underlying content or otherwise result in the payable receiving seniority with respect to other payables of the Company. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company has confirmed $338 million and $273 million, respectively, of accrued content producer liabilities. These amounts were outstanding and unpaid by the Company and were recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, given the principal purpose of the arrangement is to allow producers access to funds prior to the typical payment due date and the arrangement does not significantly change the nature of the payables and does not significantly extend the payment terms beyond the industry norms. Invoices processed through the program are subject to a one-year maximum tenor. The Company does not incur any fees or expenses associated with the paying agent services, and this service may be terminated by the Company or the financial institution upon 30 days' notice. At, or near, the production completion date (invoice due date), the Company pays the financial institution the stated amounts for confirmed producer invoices. These payments are reported as cash flows from operating activities.</p>

<h2>NOTE 19. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS</h2>
<p>Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of permanent equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets when the put right is outside of the Company's control. Redeemable noncontrolling interests reflected as of the balance sheet date are the greater of the noncontrolling interest balances adjusted for comprehensive income items and distributions or the redemption values remeasured at the period end foreign exchange rates. Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value as a result of changes in exchange rates are reflected in currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive loss. Such currency translation adjustments to redemption value are allocated to the Company's stockholders only. Redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustments of carrying value to redemption value are reflected in retained earnings, unless there is an accumulated deficit, in which case the adjustments are reflected in additional paid-in capital. The adjustment of carrying value to the redemption value that reflects a redemption in excess of fair value is included as an adjustment to income from continuing operations available to the Company's stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share. (See Note 3.) The table below summarizes the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests balances (in millions).</p>

<p>The Company's significant redeemable noncontrolling interests are described below.</p>
<h2>Discovery Family</h2>
<p>Hasbro Inc. ("Hasbro") had the right to put the entirety of its remaining 40% interest in Discovery Family to the Company at any time during the one-year period beginning December 31, 2021, or in the event the Company's performance obligation related to Discovery Family is not met. Embedded in the redeemable noncontrolling interest is also a Warner Bros. Discovery call right that is exercisable for one year after December 31, 2021. Neither the put nor call was exercised in 2022. In December 2022, Hasbro and WBD signed an amendment to the previous agreement extending the put-call election to the period January 31, 2025 to March 31, 2025. Upon the exercise of the put or call options, the price to be paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest is a function of the then-current fair market value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, to which certain discounts and redemption floor values may apply in specified situations depending upon the party exercising the put or call and the basis for the exercise of the put or call.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>MTG</h2>
<p>GoldenTree acquired a put right exercisable during 30-day windows beginning on each of March 25, 2021, September 25, 2022 and March 25, 2024, that requires the Company to either purchase all of GoldenTree's noncontrolling32.5% interest in the joint venture at fair value or participate in an initial public offering for the joint venture. In 2022, GoldenTree exercised its irrevocable put right and in 2023, the Company finalized its purchase of GoldenTree's 32.5% noncontrolling interest for $49 million.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>In August 2023, the Company and JCOM Co., Ltd. ("JCOM") executed a series of transaction agreements to which the Company and JCOM each contributed to Discovery Japan, Inc. ("JVCo"), an existing80/20 joint venture between the Company and JCOM, certain rights, liabilities, or rights via license agreements in exchange for new common shares of JVCo, resulting in the Company and JCOM owning 51% and 49% of JVCo, respectively. Retaining controlling financial interest subsequent to the transaction, the Company continues to consolidate the joint venture. As the terms of the agreement no longer incorporate JCOM's option to put its noncontrolling interest to the Company, JCOM's noncontrolling interest was reclassified from redeemable noncontrolling interest to noncontrolling interest outside of stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.</p>
<h2>NOTE 20. NONCONTROLLING INTEREST</h2>
<p>The Company has a controlling interest in the TV Food Network Partnership (the "Partnership"), which includes the Food Network and Cooking Channel. Food Network and Cooking Channel are operated and organized under the terms of the Partnership. The Company holds 80% of the voting interest and 68.7% of the economic interest in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Partnership agreement was extended and specifies a dissolution date of December 31, 2024. If the term of the Partnership is not extended prior to the dissolution date of December 31, 2024, the Partnership agreement permits the Company, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business. If for some reason the Partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests. Ownership interests attributable to the noncontrolling owner are presented as noncontrolling interests on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of the Partnership agreement, the noncontrolling owner cannot force a redemption outside of the Company's control. As such, the noncontrolling interests in the Partnership are reflected as a component of permanent equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>NOTE 21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</h2>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties. Related parties include entities that share common directorship, such as Liberty Global plc ("Liberty Global"), Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband") and their subsidiaries (collectively the "Liberty Group"). The Company's board of directors includes Dr. John Malone, who is Chairman of the Board of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and beneficially owns approximately 30% and 48% of the aggregate voting power with respect to the election of directors of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband, respectively. The majority of the revenue earned from the Liberty Group relates to multi-year network distribution arrangements. Related party transactions also include revenues and expenses for content and services provided to or acquired from equity method investees, or minority partners of consolidated subsidiaries.</p>

<h2>NOTE 22. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES</h2>
<h2>Commitments</h2>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various commitments, which primarily include programming and talent arrangements, operating and finance leases (see Note 12), arrangements to purchase various goods and services, long-term debt (see Note 11), pension funding and payments (see Note 17), and future funding commitments to equity method investees (see Note 10) (in millions).</p>

| Total | 24,072 | $ 3,242 | 1,055 | 28,369 |</p>
<p>The commitments disclosed above exclude liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>Content purchase obligations include commitments associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks and DTC services. Production and licensing contracts generally require the purchase of a specified number of episodes and payments during production or over the term of a license, and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation.</p>
<p>Other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. Some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. Other purchase obligations also include future funding commitments to equity method investees. Although the Company had funding commitments to equity method investees as of December 31, 2023, the Company may also provide uncommitted additional funding to its equity method investments in the future. (See Note 10.)</p>
<p>Other employee obligations are primarily related to employment agreements with creative talent for certain broadcast networks.</p>
<h2>Six Flags Guarantee</h2>
<p>In connection with WM's former investment in the Six Flags (as defined below) theme parks located in Georgia and Texas (collectively, the "Parks"), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the Company agreed to guarantee (the "Six Flags Guarantee") certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the Parks (the "Partnerships") for the benefit of the limited partners in such Partnerships, including annual payments made to the Parks or to the limited partners and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the Partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The aggregate gross undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the Six Flags Guarantee over the remaining term (through 2028) are $521 million. To date, no payments have been made by the Company pursuant to the Six Flags Guarantee.</p>
<h2>WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as Six Flags, Inc. and Premier Parks Inc.) ("Six Flags"), which has the controlling interest in the Parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the "Subordinated Indemnity Agreement"), to guarantee the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations when due and to indemnify the Company, among others, if the Six Flags Guarantee is called upon. If Six Flags defaults on its indemnification obligations, the Company has the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the Parks. Six Flags' obligations to the Company are further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by Six Flags.</p>
<p>Based on the Company's evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the Guaranteed Obligations and the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, it is unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the Guaranteed Obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized as of December 31, 2023. Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial guarantee, the Company is unable to determine a current fair value for the Guaranteed Obligations and related Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.</p>
<h2>Contingencies</h2>
<h2>Other Contingent Commitments</h2>
<p>Other contingent commitments primarily include contingent payments for post-production term advance obligations on a certain co-financing arrangement, as well as operating lease commitment guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds, which generally support performance and payments for a wide range of global contingent and firm obligations, including insurance, litigation appeals, real estate leases, and other operational needs.</p>
<p>The Company's other contingent commitments at December 31, 2023 were $395 million, with $367 million estimated to be due in 2024. For other contingent commitments where payment obligations are outside of our control, the timing of amounts represents the earliest period in which the payment could be requested. For the remaining other contingent commitments, the timing of the amounts presented represents when the maximum contingent commitment will expire but does not mean that we expect to incur an obligation to make any payments within that time period. In addition, these amounts do not reflect the effects of any indemnification rights we might possess.</p>
<h2>Put Rights</h2>
<p>The Company has granted put rights to non-controlling interest holders in certain consolidated subsidiaries, but the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. (See Note 19.)</p>
<h2>Legal Matters</h2>
<p>From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual property, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. However, a determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. The Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for such matters until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is made and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Guarantees</h2>
<p>There were no guarantees recorded under ASC 460 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company may provide or receive indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for certain obligations of a divested business in the event that a third party does not fulfill its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and estimable. There were no material amounts for indemnifications or other contingencies recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.</p>

<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>NOTE 23. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company's operating segments are determined based on: (i) financial information reviewed by its chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis upon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company updated its DTC subscriber definition to include Premium Sports Products, which were previously included in the Networks segment. Prior period segment results were not recast to reflect this change because the impact was not material.</p>
<p>The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Company's, except that certain inter-segment transactions that are eliminated for consolidation are not eliminated at the segment level. Inter-segment transactions primarily include advertising and content licenses. The Company records inter-segment transactions of content licenses at the gross amount. The Company does not report assets by segment because it is not used to allocate resources or evaluate segment performance.</p>
<p>The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:</p>
<ul>
<li>· employee share-based compensation;</li>
<li>· depreciation and amortization;</li>
<li>· restructuring and facility consolidation;</li>
<li>· certain impairment charges;</li>
<li>· gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;</li>
<li>· certain inter-segment eliminations;</li>
<li>· third-party transaction and integration costs;</li>
<li>· amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;</li>
<li>· amortization of capitalized interest for content; and</li>
<li>· other items impacting comparability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.</p>
