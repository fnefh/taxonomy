Forward-Looking Statements
--------------------------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (the "Company," "Arena, " "we," "our," and "us") contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, future revenues, market growth, capital requirements, product introductions, the timing, outcome or financial impacts of the planned Business Combination (as defined below) and related transactions and expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding. Other statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical facts are also forward-looking statements. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and other stylistic variants denoting forward-looking statements.

We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Quarterly Report, or that we may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on information currently available, as well as our beliefs and assumptions. The actual outcome related to forward-looking statements will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based only on known results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. We detail other risks in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 and in Item 1A of Part II of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

This Quarterly Report and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report except as may be required by law.

THE ARENA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
-----------------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
----------------------------------------------------

(unaudited)
-----------

($ in thousands, unless otherwise stated)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
---------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as TheMaven, Inc.) and its wholly owned subsidiaries ("The Arena Group" or the "Company"), after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. The Company changed its legal name to The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. from TheMaven, Inc. on February 8, 2022.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for complete audited financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in The Arena Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023.

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, are unaudited but, in management's opinion, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year.

The Company is subject to continuing risks and uncertainties in connection with the current macroeconomic environment, including as a result of inflation, increasing interest rates, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, supply chain disruptions and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that certain of the Company's sports businesses rely on sporting events to generate content and comprise a material portion of the Company's revenues, the Company's cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted by a significant downturn in economic activity, or general spending on sporting events or a general limitation of societal activity, due to market conditions, economic uncertainty or recession.

The Company operates in one reportable segment.

Reverse Stock Split
-------------------

On February 8, 2022, the Company's board of directors (the "Board") approved aone-for-twenty-two (1-for-22) reverse stock splitof its outstanding shares of common stock that was effective February 8, 2022. The Company's common stock began trading on the NYSE American on February 9, 2022. At the effective time, every twenty-two shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the number of authorized shares. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next whole number.

10

Going Concern
-------------

The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any

adjustments that might be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $50,027. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had cash on hand of $7,290 and $13,871 and a working capital deficit of $68,332 and $137,669, respectively. The Company's net loss and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due. Furthermore, while the Company has executed an amendment to extend the maturity of its 2022 Bridge Notes of $36,000, Senior Secured Notes of $62,691, Delayed Draw Term Notes of $4,000 and to extend additional borrowings on its 2023 Notes of $6,000 (each as described in Note 11 and Note 12), totaling $108,691, if the Business Combination (as further described under the heading Business Combination in Note 20) is not completed by December 31, 2023 it would represent an event of default under the related debt agreements in which case the Company may not be able to meet its obligations when due.

As a result, management determined there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless they are able to close the Business Combination by December 31, 2023 or extend the date at which such a default would occur.

The Company plans to consummate the Business Combination to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate the Business Combination.

Use of Estimates
----------------

Preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial instruments, capitalization of platform development, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions, determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation and valuation of derivatives liabilities and contingent liabilities, among others. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Reclassifications
-----------------

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications were immaterial, both individually and in aggregate. These changes did not impact previously reported loss from operations or net loss.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
-------------------------------------

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, addressing areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard (ASU 2016-13) that introduced the current expected credit losses (CECL) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This update requires an entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. As the Company has already adopted ASU 2016-13, the new guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

11

Loss per Common Share
---------------------

Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as stock options, restricted stock, and warrants. All restricted stock awards are considered outstanding but are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. All restricted stock units are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. Contingently issuable shares are included in basic loss per common share only when there are no circumstances under which those shares would not be issued. Diluted loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

The Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below (capitalized terms are described herein), which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, from its calculation of net loss per common share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the diluted calculations when a net loss is incurred as they would be anti-dilutive.

|  | As of September 30, | As of September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- |

2. Discontinued Operations
--------------------------

The Company, upon Board approval on September 15, 2022, discontinued (i.e., the "discontinued operations") the Parade print business ("Parade Print") that was acquired on April 1, 2022 (as part of the Parade acquisition, as further described below in Note 3), on November 13, 2022 (the last date of any obligation to deliver issues of Parade Print).

The table below sets forth the loss from discontinued operations for the period from April 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022:

| Revenue | 20,753 |
| --- | --- |
| Cost of revenue | 16,940 |
| Gross profit | 3,813 |

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded depreciation and amortization of $0 and $0, respectively; and operating and investing noncash items of $209 and $209, respectively, as part of the discontinued operations.

12

3. Acquisitions
---------------

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which is based on ASC, Business Combinations (Topic 805) , and uses the fair value concepts which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.

2023 Acquisition
----------------

Teneology, Inc. - On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Teneology, Inc., ("Teneology") pursuant to which it acquired certain assets (consisting of the RoadFood media business, including digital and television assets; the Moveable Feast media business, including digital and television assets; the Fexy-branded content studio business; and the MonkeySee YouTube Channel media business, collectively "Fexy Studios"), for a purchase price of $3,307. The purchase price consisted of the following: (1) $500 cash paid at closing (including an advance payment of $250 prior to closing); (2) $75 deferred cash payments due in three equal installments of $25 on March 1, 2023 (paid), April 1, 2023 (paid) and May 1, 2023 (paid); (3) $200 deferred cash payment due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to certain indemnity provisions; and (4) the issuance of 274,692 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain lock-up provisions, with a fair value of $2,000 on the transaction closing date (fair value was determined based on a preliminary independent appraisal); and which is subject to a put option under certain conditions (the "contingent consideration") (as further described below in Note 10). The number of shares of the Company's common stock issued was determined based on a $2,225 value using the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the January 11, 2023 closing date (on the closing date the common stock trading price was $7.94 per share). The agreement also provided for a cash retention pool for certain employees of $300, subject to vesting over three years upon continued employment and other conditions.

The composition of the preliminary purchase price is as follows:

| Cash | $ 500 |
| --- | --- |
| Common stock | 2,000 |
| Contingent consideration | 561 |
| Deferred cash payments, as discounted | 246 |
| Total purchase consideration | $ 3,307 |

The Company accounted for the asset acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 since the acquisition met the definition of a business under the applicable guidance.

The Company incurred $99 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Advertiser relationships | 663 |
| --- | --- |
| Brand names | 659 |
| Goodwill | 1,985 |
| Net assets acquired | 3,307 |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the preliminary determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the advertiser relationships were valued using the excess earnings method of the income approach and the brand names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The estimated useful life is fifteen years (15.0 years) for the advertiser relationships and twelve years (12.0 years) for the brand names.

The excess-of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. A portion of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.

13

Supplemental Pro forma Information
----------------------------------

The pro forma disclosures have been deemed impracticable for this acquisition since after making reasonable efforts the Company is unable to accept assumptions made by Teneology. The Company has determined, based on the information provided by Teneology and made available to the Company, that the earnings from the prior periods could not be verified since the acquisition only included certain activities of Teneology and financial statements were not available. In this regard, the Company: (1) made reasonable effort to obtain certain financial results of the certain activities but Teneology was unable to comply with this request; and (2) the presentation of the pro forma results and the assumptions made by Teneology management were unable to be independently substantiated.

2022 Acquisition
----------------

Athlon Holdings, Inc . - On April 1, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Athlon Holdings, Inc. ("Athlon" or Parade), a Tennessee corporation, for a purchase price of $15,854, as adjusted for the working capital adjustment as of the closing date of the transaction. The working capital adjustment is pending acceptance by the sellers (further details are provided in Note 19). As a part of the closing consideration, the Company also acquired cash of $1,840, that was further adjusted post-closing for the working capital adjustment. The purchase price of $15,854, as discounted, is comprised of (i) a cash portion of

$12,827, with $11,840 paid at closing and $987 estimated to be paid post-closing (as further described below) and (ii) the issuance of314,103 shares of the Company's common stock with a fair market value of $3,141. The number of shares of the Company's common stock issued was determined based on a $3,000 value using the common stock trading price for the 10 trading days preceding the April 1, 2022 closing date. Certain of Parade's key employees entered into either advisory agreements or employment agreements with the Company. Parade operates in the United States.

The amount estimated to be paid post-closing of $987 will be or was paid as follows: (i) $742 is expected to be paid upon receipts of certain tax refunds due to the sellers (consisting of $3,000 for the deferred cash payments, as discounted, less a $2,258 cash adjustment); and (ii) $245 was paid within two business days from the date the Company received proceeds from the sale of the equity interest in Just Like Falling Off a Bike, LLC that was held by Parade as of the closing date (paid on April 7, 2022).

The Company received a final valuation report from a third-party valuation firm after the preliminary purchase price was adjusted during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022. After considering the results of the final valuation report, the Company estimated that the purchase consideration decreased by $321. The decrease in the purchase price was related to an increase in identifiable assets of $54, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $27, with a decrease in the working capital adjustment of $321, resulting in a decrease in goodwill of $348.

The composition of the purchase price is as follows:

| Cash | 12,085 |
| --- | --- |
| Common stock | 3,141 |
| Deferred cash payments, as discounted | 628 |
| Total purchase consideration | 15,854 |

The Company incurred $200 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded within general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

14

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Cash | $ 2,604 |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts receivable | 10,855 |
| Other current assets | 1,337 |
| Equity investment | 2,450 |
| Fixed assets | 108 |
| Digital content | 355 |
| Advertiser relationships | 6,202 |
| Trade names | 2,261 |
| Goodwill | 2,587 |
| Accounts payable | (7,416) |
| Accrued expenses and other | (2,440) |
| Unearned revenue | (1,203) |
| Other long-term liabilities | (543) |
| Deferred tax liabilities | (1,303) |
| Net assets acquired | $ 15,854 |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the digital content was determined using a cost approach. The fair values of the advertiser relationships were determined by projecting the acquired entity's cash flows, deducting notional contributory asset charges on supporting assets (working capital, tangible assets, trade names, and the assembled workforce) to compute the excess cash flows associated with the advertiser relationships. The fair values of the trade names were determined by projecting revenue associated with each trade name and applying a royalty rate to compute the amount of the royalty payments the company is relieved from paying due to its ownership of the trade names. The estimated weighted average useful life is two years (2.00 years) for digital content, eight point seventy-five years (8.75 years) for advertiser relationships, and fourteen point five years (14.50 years) for trade names.

The excess purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. No portion of the goodwill related to the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

Supplemental Pro forma Information
----------------------------------

The following table summarizes the results of operations of the Parade acquisition from the acquisition date included in the condensed consolidated results of operations and the unaudited pro forma results of operations of the combined entity had the date of the acquisition been as of the beginning of the reporting period during the year of the acquisition, or January 1, 2021:

The information presented above is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the Company's reporting period and does not reflect the discontinued operations of Parade Print that was acquired on April 1, 2022 (as part of the Parade acquisition).

The adjustments for the three months ended September 2022 of $317, represents adjustments: (1) to record depreciation and amortization expense related to the fixed and intangible assets acquired from the acquisition of ($216); and (2) to reverse the deferred tax provision related to the acquisition $533. The adjustments for the nine months ended September 2022 of ($1,724), represents adjustments: (1) to record depreciation and amortization expense related to the fixed and intangible assets acquired from the acquisition of ($648); (2) to reverse the nonrecurring transaction cost related to the acquisition of $200; and (3) to reverse the deferred tax benefit related to the acquisition of ($1,276).

Buffalo Groupe, LLC - On September 27, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Buffalo Groupe, LLC, doing business as Morning Read, a Virginia limited liability company, where it purchased certain intellectual properties (including all media properties, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names corporate names and other identifiers of goodwill), certain assumed contracts, and other certain rights related to the intellectual properties (collectively, the "Morning Read Purchased Assets") and assumed certain liabilities related to the Morning Read Purchased Assets. The purchase consideration consisted of a cash payment of $850,000 at closing.

The Company accounted for the asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired by the Company is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets.

The purchase consideration totaled $850,000, which was assigned to the brand name acquired on the closing date of the acquisition. The useful life for the brand name is ten years (10.0 years).

4. Balance Sheet Components
---------------------------

The components of certain balance sheet amounts are as follows:

Accounts Receivable - The Company receives payments from advertising customers based upon contractual payment terms; accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected within 90 days. The Company generally receives payments from digital and print subscription customers at the time of sign up for each subscription; accounts receivable from merchant credit card processors are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected weekly. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company's ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued. Accounts receivable as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 of $37,977 and $33,950, respectively, are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:

|  | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited) | Year Ended December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts beginning of year | 2,236 | 1,578 |
| Additions | 217 | 980 |
| Deductions - write-offs | (1,514 ) | (322 ) |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts end of period | 939 | 2,236 |

Subscription Acquisition Costs - Subscription acquisition costs include the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, paid to external parties, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has determined that sales commissions paid on all third-party agent sales of subscriptions are direct and incremental and, therefore, meet the capitalization criteria. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to account for these costs at the portfolio level. The sales commissions paid to third-party agents are amortized as magazines are sent to the subscriber on an issue-by-issue basis. Subscription acquisition costs are included within selling and marketing expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The current portion of the subscription acquisition costs as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $31,944 and $25,931, respectively. The noncurrent portion of the subscription acquisition costs as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $9,751 and $14,133, respectively. Subscription acquisition costs as of September 30, 2023 presented as current assets of $31,944 are expected to be amortized over a one-year period, or through September 30, 2024, and presented as longterm assets of $9,751 are expected to be amortized after the one-year period ending September 30, 2024.

Amortization of subscription acquisition costs of $9,819 and $9,778 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in selling and marketing expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of subscription acquisition costs of $29,166 and $28,236 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in selling and marketing expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. No impairment losses have been recognized for subscription acquisition costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

17

Prepayments and other current assets - Prepayments and other current assets are summarized as follows:

|  | As of | As of |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Prepaid expenses | 2,891 | 2,321 |
| Prepaid supplies | 1,101 | 927 |
| Refundable income and franchise taxes | 157 | 957 |

| Employee retention credits | 2,468 | - |
| Other receivables | 73 | 20 |

10. Fair Value
--------------

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies the Company believes to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company would realize upon disposition.

The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, which are described below:

Level 1 . Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2 . Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and

Level 3 . Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which result in the use of management estimates.

The Company accounted for certain common stock issued in connection with the Fexy Studios acquisition that is subject to a put option (which provides for a cash payment to the sellers on the first anniversary date of the closing (or January 11, 2024) in the event the common stock trading price on such date is less than the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the acquisition date, or $8.10 per share), as a derivative liability, which requires the Company to carry such amounts on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as a liability at fair value, as adjusted at each reporting period-end.

Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following as of September 30, 2023:

|  | Fair Value | Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contingent consideration | $ 1,030 | $ | $ 1,030 | $ - |

Contingent Consideration - The fair value of the contingent consideration is primarily dependent on the common stock trading price on the first anniversary of the closing of Fexy Studios, or January 11, 2024. The estimated fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following inputs: (i) $8.10 exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock at the acquisition date; (ii) $4.28 common stock price equal to the trading price of the Company's common stock as of the reporting date; (iii) 0.25 years for the expected term; (iv)5.34% annualized risk free rate; (v)76.00% selected volatility and (vi) 0.00% dividend yield. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in valuation of the contingent consideration of $ 60 and $469 in expense, respectively, was recognized in other expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Contract Balances
-----------------

The timing of the Company's performance under its various contracts often differs from the timing of the customer's payment, which results in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability. A contract asset is recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer and the Company does not have the contractual right to bill for the related performance obligations. A contract liability is recognized when consideration is received from the customer prior to the transfer of goods or services.

The following table provides information about contract balances:

|  | As of | As of |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | September 30, 2023 (unaudited) | December 31, 2022 |
| Unearned revenue (short-term contract liabilities): |  |  |
| Digital revenue | 18,452 | $ 18,571 |

| Digital revenue | 738 | 1,118 |
| Print revenue | 13,794 | 18,583 |

Unearned Revenue - Unearned revenue, also referred to as contract liabilities, include payments received in advance of performance under certain contracts and are recognized as revenue over time. The Company records contract liabilities as unearned revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

17. Income Taxes
----------------

The provision for income taxes in interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company's annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of its annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The quarterly provision for income taxes, and estimate of the Company's annual effective tax rate, are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in pre-tax income (or loss), the mix of jurisdictions to which such income relates, changes in how the Company conducts business, and tax law developments.

31

The income tax provision (benefit) effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was0.33% and (2.06%), respectively. The deferred income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was primarily due to deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangible assets.

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. Based upon the Company's historical operating losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against most of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.

As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company hasno uncertain tax positions or interest and penalties accrued.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors.. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see "Forward-Looking Statements."

Overview
--------

We are a tech-powered media company that focuses on building deep content verticals powered by a best-in-class digital media platform (the "Platform") empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. Our strategy is to focus on key verticals where audiences are passionate about a topic category (e.g., sports and finance), and where we can leverage the strength of our core brands to grow our audience and increase monetization both within our core brands as well as our media publisher partners (each, a "Publisher Partner"). Our focus is on leveraging our Platform and iconic brands in targeted verticals to maximize audience reach, improve engagement, and optimize monetization of digital publishing assets for the benefit of our users, our advertiser clients, and our greater than 40 owned and operated properties as well as properties we run on behalf of independent Publisher Partners. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated, own and operate TheStreet, Inc. College Spun Media Incorporated, Parade Media, and Men's Journal and power more than 320 independent Publisher Partners, including the many sports team sites that comprise FanNation. Each Publisher Partner joins the Platform by invitation only and is drawn from premium media brands and independent publishing businesses with the objective of augmenting our position in key verticals and optimizing the performance of the Publisher Partner. Publisher Partners incur the costs in content creation on their respective channels and receive a share of the revenue associated with their content. Because of the state-of-the-art technology and large scale of the Platform and our expertise in search engine optimization, social media, ad monetization and subscription marketing, Publisher Partners continually benefit from our ongoing technological advances and bespoke audience development expertise. Additionally, we believe the lead brand within each vertical creates a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners in the vertical while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While the Publisher Partners benefit from these critical performance improvements they also may save substantially in costs of technology, infrastructure, advertising sales, and member marketing and management.

Of the more than 320 Publisher Partners, a large majority of them publish content within one of our four verticals of sports, finance, lifestyle or men's lifestyle, and oversee an online community for their respective sites, leveraging our Platform, monetization operation, distribution channels and data and analytics offerings and benefiting from our ability to engage the collective audiences within a single network. Generally, Publisher Partners are independently owned, strategic partners who

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. Audiences expand and advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Publisher Partners onto a single platform and a large and experienced sales organization. They may also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue.

Our growth strategy is to continue to expand by adding new premium publishers with high quality brands and content either as independent Publisher Partners, by acquiring publishers as owned and operated entities or strategic expansion as described under Recent Developments .

Recent Developments
-------------------

On November 5, 2023, we signed a definitive business combination agreement (the "BCA") to combine its operations with those of Bridge Media Networks, LLC ("Bridge Media Networks" or "Bridge Media") a wholly owned subsidiary of Simplify Inventions, LLC ("Simplify"). The transactions contemplated by the BCA (the "Transaction(s)" or the "Transaction Agreement") are subject to customary conditions, including the approval by the Company's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. Key components of the BCA and related transactions include: (i) a restructure of the Company's balance sheet and pay down of approximately $20,000 of the 2022 Bridge Notes and $6,000 of the 2023 Notes and the extension of the maturity date of its remaining Notes for a period of three years at an interest rate of 10.0%; (ii) a cash investment of approximately $50,000, comprised of a $25,000 purchase of common stock and a $25,000 investment in newly created Series L preferred stock with a 10.0% non-cash paid-in-kind (PIK) dividend; (iii) an advertising commitment of approximately $60,000 to be spent $12,000 annually for five (5) years from a group of consumer brands also owned by Simplify; and (iv) a business combination resulting in the Company owning and operating Bridge Media Networks' two 24hour networks, NEWSnet and Sports News Highlights, as well as the automotive and travel properties Driven and TravelHost (these components collectively defined as the "Business Combination"). The Business Combination will result in Simplify and related entities holding approximately 65.0% upon consummation of the transaction of the fully diluted common stock of a newly formed company ("New Arena") to effectuate the Business Combination.

In addition, at the closing of the Business Combination, New Arena will enter into a stock purchase agreement with Simplify or one of its affiliates (the "Simplify SPA Party"), pursuant to which the Simplify SPA Party will agree to purchase such number of shares of New Arena common stock having an aggregate value of $20,000 in one or more private placements at New Arena's option for one-year from the closing date of the Business Combination (the "additional equity issuances"). Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, at closing of the Business Combination, 60,000 shares of New Arena's common stock will be issued as payment of a 1.5% commitment fee.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions
----------------------------------

Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to our business. We are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties in connection with the current macroeconomic environment, including as a result of increases in inflation, rising interest rates and instability in the global banking system and geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the responses thereto, and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of our business, the ultimate extent of the impact on our business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of our control and could exist for an extended period of time. As a result, we are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties and continue to closely monitor the impact of the current conditions on our business. For additional information, see the sections titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report.

Key Operating Metrics
---------------------

We monitor and review the key operating metrics described below as we believe that these metrics are relevant for our industry and specifically to us and to understanding our business. Moreover, they form the basis for trends informing certain predictions related to our financial condition. Our key operating metrics focus primarily on our digital advertising revenue, which has experienced significant growth in recent periods, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 19% and 14%, respectively, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Management monitors and reviews these metrics because such metrics are readily measurable in real time and can provide valuable insight into the performance of and trends related to our digital advertising revenue and our overall business. We consider only those key operating metrics described here to be material to our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Our key operating metrics are identified below:

* ● Revenue per page view ("RPM") - represents the advertising revenue earned per 1,000 pageviews. It is calculated as our advertising revenue during a period divided by our total page views during that period and multiplied by $1,000; and
* ● Monthly average pageviews - represents the total number of pageviews in a given month or the average of each month's pageviews in a fiscal quarter or year, which is calculated as the total number of page views recorded in a quarter or year divided by three months or 12 months, respectively.

For pricing indicators, we focus on RPM as it is the pricing metric most closely aligned with monthly average pageviews. RPM is an indicator of yield and pricing driven by both advertising density and demand from our advertisers.

Monthly average pageviews are measured across all properties hosted on the Arena Platform and provide us with insight into volume, engagement and effective page management and are therefore our primary measure of traffic. We utilize a third-party source, Google Analytics, to confirm this traffic data.

As described above, these key operating metrics are critical for management as they provide insights into our digital advertising revenue generation and overall business performance. This information also provides feedback on the content on our website and its ability to attract and engage users, which allows us to make strategic business decisions designed to drive more users to read or view more of our content and generate higher advertising revenue across all properties hosted on the Arena Platform.

35

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 our RPM was $22.98 and $19.73, representing a 35% and 23% increase from RPM of $17.00 and $16.01 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 our monthly average pageviews were 424,892,705 and 446,094,684, representing a decline of 12% and 8% as compared to monthly average pageviews were 484,299,721 and 482,326,093 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

All dollar figures presented below are in thousands unless otherwise stated.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Going Concern

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a net loss of $50,027. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $7,290 and $13,871 and a working capital deficit of $68,332 and $137,669, respectively. Our net loss and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet our obligations when due. Furthermore, while we have executed an amendment to extend the maturity of our 2022 Bridge Notes of $36,000, Senior Secured Notes of $62,691, Delayed Draw Term Notes of $4,000 and to extend additional borrowings on our 2023 Notes of $6,000 (each as described in the condensed consolidated financial statements), totaling $108,691, if the Business Combination is not completed by December 31, 2023 it would represent an event of default under the related debt agreements in which case we may not be able to meet our obligations when due.

As a result, management determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless we are able to close the Business Combination by December 31, 2023 or extend the date at which such a default would occur.

Cash and Working Capital Facility
---------------------------------

As of September 30, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of $7,290. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, we had $22,697 available for additional use, subject to eligible accounts receivable, under our working capital line of credit with SLR Digital Finance LLC (formerly FastPay) ("SLR"). As of September 30, 2023, the outstanding balance of the SLR working capital line of credit was $17,303. We also had accounts receivable, net of our advances from SLR of $20,674 as of September 30, 2023. Our cash balance as of the issuance date of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements is $4,586.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
------------------------------

As of September 30, 2023, pursuant to our SLR line of credit, as disclosed above, in the event that our line of credit is accelerated, we will be obligated to pay SLR either a termination fee or performance fee equal to $900.

As of September 30, 2023, in connection with the Sports Illustrated media business, we guaranteed a minimum annual royalty of $15,000 through December 31, 2029, for a total of $78,750.

36

Material Contractual Obligations
--------------------------------

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business primarily consisting of employment contracts, consulting agreements, leases, liquidated damages, debt and related interest payments. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. See Notes 5, 9, 11 and 12 in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2023, related to leases, liquidated damages, bridge notes and term debt. During 2022, we assumed the lease from Men's Journal for office space in Carlsbad, California, that expires in March 2025, and we remain responsible for $2,142 over the lease term that may be offset after considering certain space that we sublet where we are entitled to receive $435. The lease provides for fixed payments ranging from $89 to $94 over the remainder of the lease term, with an estimate of common expenses per month of $25 through the end of the lease term. There have been no material changes from the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The primary driver of the increase in our digital revenue of $7,834 is derived from our digital advertising revenue and other digital revenue which increased by $8,147 and $1,058, respectively, which was primarily offset by a decrease in our digital subscriptions of $1,448. Digital revenue represented 72.3% of total revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $66.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 6.0 percentage points. Offsetting the increase in our digital revenue, our print revenue decreased by $1,693 with a 34.4% decrease in print advertising and a 3.2% decrease in print subscription revenue. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 has been adjusted for the discontinued operations of the Parade print business that was acquired in April 2022 totaling $20,753 since the operations were discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2022.

We recorded $639 of accrued interest on our liquidated damages payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily from issuance of the same securities as described above.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
----------------------------------

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"); however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that are noncash in nature or not related to our core business operations. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss as adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, with additional adjustments for (i) interest expense (net), (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration; (vi) liquidated damages, (vii) loss on impairment of assets, (viii) employee retention credit, (ix) employee restructuring payments, and (x) professional and vendor fees.

Our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA:

* ● does not reflect interest expense, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;
* ● does not reflect deferred income taxes, which is a noncash expense;
* ● does not reflect depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a noncash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, increasing our cash requirements;
* ● does not reflect stock-based compensation and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs;
* ● does not reflect the change in fair value of contingent consideration, which is a noncash expense;
* ● does not reflect liquidated damages and, therefore, does not include future cash requirements if we repay the liquidated damages in cash instead of shares of our common stock (which the investor would need to agree to);
* ● does not reflect any losses from the impairment of assets, which is a noncash operating expense;
* ● does not reflect the employee retention credits recorded by us for payroll related tax credits under the Cares Act;
* ● does not reflect payments related to employee restructuring changes for our former Chief Executive Officer; and
* ● does not reflect the professional and vendor fees incurred by us for services provided by consultants, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors, which services were related to certain types of events that are not reflective of our business operations.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:

|  | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Net loss | $ (11,166 ) | $ (16,505 ) | $ (50,027 ) | $ (57,161 ) |
| Net loss from discontinued operations | - | 646 | - | 1,329 |
| Net loss from continued operations | (11,166 ) | (15,859 ) | (50,027 ) | (55,832 ) |
| Add (deduct): |  |  |  |  |
| Interest expense, net (1) | 4,042 | 3,184 | 13,225 | 8,510 |
| Income tax provision (benefit) | 61 | 547 | 168 | (1,180 ) |
| Depreciation and amortization (2) | 6,917 | 6,891 | 21,110 | 20,223 |
| Stock-based compensation (3) | 4,362 | 8,311 | 16,978 | 24,777 |
| Change in fair value of contingent consideration (4) | 60 | - | 469 | - |
| Liquidated damages (5) | 151 | 339 | 455 | 639 |
| Loss on impairment of assets (6) | - | - | 119 | 257 |
| Employee retention credit (7) | - | - | (6,868 ) | - |
| Employee restructuring payments (8) | 735 | - | 4,997 | 679 |
| Professional and vendor fees (9) | 1,194 | - | 1,194 | - |
| Adjusted EBITDA | $ 6,356 | $ 3,413 | $ 1,820 | $ (1,927 ) |

* (3) Stock-based compensation represents noncash costs arise from the grant of stock-based awards to employees, consultants and directors. We believe that excluding the effect of stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons in our operating performance because (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations, and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Additionally, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA assists management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between our operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
------------------------------------------

Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions.

Except as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 that was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted as of the date of this report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Not applicable to a "smaller reporting company" as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of SEC Regulation S-K.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
------------------------------------------------

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

47

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. In light of the material weaknesses described in Part II, Item 9A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 that continue and have not been remediated as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report, we have performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures to determine whether our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023 in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our control procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we continue to review, test, and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
-----------------------------------------------------

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
---------------------------

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
-------------------------

From time to time, we may be subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
---------------------

There are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following risk factors supplement and, to the extent inconsistent, supersede, the risk factors described in Part I, "Item IA. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 (the "2022 10-K"). The risk factors included herein as well as the risk factors described in the 2022 Form 10-K should be carefully considered, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with SEC in connection with evaluating us, our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us at present, or that we currently deem immaterial, may affect us. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Pending Transaction with Bridge Media Networks and Simplify.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transactions may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and failure to complete the Transactions may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transactions are subject to several closing conditions, including the adoption of the Transaction Agreement and approval of the Transactions by our stockholders, the effectiveness of a registration statement relating to the registration of the issuance of the New Arena common stock in the Transactions, the approval of the listing of the New Arena common stock on the NYSE American and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"). If any one of these conditions is not satisfied or waived, the Transactions may not be completed. There is no assurance that the Transactions will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.

Under the Transaction Agreement, the parties' obligations to complete the Transactions are conditioned on the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

If our stockholders do not adopt the Transaction Agreement and approve the Transactions or if the Transactions are not completed for any other reason, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

* ● our stockholders would not become stockholders of New Arena and therefore would not realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, including any anticipated synergies from combining New Arena and Bridge Media;
* ● the failure to consummate the Transactions by December 31, 2023 would result in an event of default under certain of our debt facilities; and
* ● the trading price of our common stock may experience increased volatility to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed.

The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We are also exposed to general competitive pressures and risks, which may be increased if the Transactions are not completed.

49
--

Each of Arena and Bridge Media will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transactions are pending that could adversely affect each of them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on either or both of us and Bridge Media, regardless of whether the Transactions are eventually completed, and, consequently, on New Arena. These uncertainties may impair our and Bridge Media's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are completed, or the Transaction Agreement is terminated, and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us or Bridge Media to seek to change or discontinue existing business relationships with us or Bridge Media.

Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging for us and Bridge Media during the pendency of the Transactions, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with New Arena. For each of us and Bridge Media, the departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment with New Arena, despite Arena's and Bridge Media's retention and recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our and New Arena's business, financial condition and operating results, regardless of whether the Transactions are eventually completed.

The pursuit of the Transactions and the preparation for the integration of Arena and Bridge Media have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on the management and internal resources of Arena and Bridge Media. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of closing the Transactions and integrating Arena and Bridge Media, which could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of each of the existing businesses, regardless of whether the Transactions are eventually completed. Before and immediately following the closing, the management teams of Arena and Bridge Media will be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage their respective existing businesses, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products, services or strategies. One potential consequence of such distractions could be the failure of management to realize other opportunities that could be beneficial to Arena or Bridge Media, respectively. If Arena's or Bridge Media's senior management is not able to effectively manage the process leading up to and immediately following the closing, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the business of Arena or Bridge Media could suffer.

In addition, the Transaction Agreement restricts Arena and Simplify (with respect to Bridge Media) from taking specified actions without the consent of the other until the Transactions are consummated or the Transaction Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent Arena and Simplify (with respect to Bridge Media) from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to their businesses before completion of the Transactions or termination of the Transaction Agreement.

Further, we and our directors could become subject to lawsuits relating to the Transactions that may be filed. While we intend to defend against any such actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

The integration of Arena and Bridge Media following the closing will present challenges that may not result in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.

The Transactions involve the combination of businesses that currently operate as independent businesses. New Arena will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the Transactions, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties New Arena may encounter in the integration process include the following:

* ● the inability to successfully integrate the businesses, including operations, technologies, products and services, in a manner that permits New Arena to achieve the anticipated benefits from the Transactions, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
* ● lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of any of the businesses deciding not to do business with New Arena;
* ● the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;
* ● potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Transactions;
* ● integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and business cultures, while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;
* ● consolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures as well as accounting systems and related financial reporting activities and difficulty implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in particular; and
* ● preserving important relationships of Arena and Bridge Media and resolving potential conflicts that may arise.

50
--

If New Arena experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of New Arena during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transactions.

The Transaction Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Arena.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transaction Agreement contains provisions that may discourage third parties from submitting business combination proposals to Arena that might result in greater value to Arena stockholders than the Transactions. The Transaction Agreement generally prohibits Arena from soliciting any competing acquisition proposal.

Following the completion of the Transactions, New Arena will be controlled by Simplify. The interests of Simplify may differ from the interests of other stockholders of New Arena.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Immediately following the closing, Simplify will beneficially own 58.02% of the outstanding shares of New Arena common stock and 5-Hour will own 6.98% of the outstanding shares of New Arena common stock, in each case on a fully diluted basis. 5-Hour is an affiliate of Simplify. Such amounts exclude the ownership of shares of New Arena common stock that may be issued from time to time pursuant to the additional equity issuances to be provided to Arena by Simplify or an affiliate thereof.

Through its ownership of at least a majority of the shares of New Arena common stock and the provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation of New Arena, the bylaw of New Arena and the nominating agreement to be entered into in connection with the Transactions, Simplify will have the ability to designate and elect a majority of the directors of the New Arena board of directors. New Arena will avail itself of available "Controlled Company" exemptions to the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE American that would otherwise require New Arena to have (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed solely of independent directors and (iii) a compensation committee that is composed solely of independent directors.

For as long as Simplify beneficially owns a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, Simplify will also have control over all other matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including changes in capital structure, transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law and corporate governance. Simplify and its subsidiaries may have different interests than other holders of New Arena common stock and may make decisions adverse to your interests.

Among other things, Simplify's control could delay, defer, or prevent a sale of New Arena that New Arena's other stockholders support, or, conversely, this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire New Arena common stock and, as a result, might impact the market price of New Arena common stock.

51

Arena and New Arena will incur transaction-related costs in connection with the Transactions and the integration of the businesses.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arena has incurred transaction-related costs in connection with the Transactions and both Arena and New Arena will incur costs in connection with the integration of Arena's and Bridge Media's businesses. There are many systems that must be integrated, including information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Arena and Bridge Media are in the early stages of assessing the magnitude of these costs and, therefore, are not able to provide estimates of these costs. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, reduce the anticipated benefits that New Arena expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the Transactions, and accordingly, any net synergies may not be achieved in the near term or at all. These integration expenses may result in New Arena taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Transactions. Some of these costs and expenses will be incurred even if the Transactions are not consummated.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

None.

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
---------------------------------------

None.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
-------------------------------

Not applicable.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

None.
