## EXPLANATORY NOTE

("Maven," the "Company," "us," "we," or "our"), is filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the "Fiscal Year Period") as part of its efforts to become current in its filing obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Included in this Annual Report are the Company's audited financial statements and related financial information for the Fiscal Year Period, which have not previously been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

We intend to file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021 as soon as reasonably practicable. Following the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we will be current in our filing obligations.

## Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements and information in this Annual Report may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, future revenues, market growth, capital requirements, product introductions, and expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding. Other statements contained in this Annual Report that are not historical facts are also forward-looking statements. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and other comparable terminology.

We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Annual Report, or that we may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on the beliefs of, assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Such statements are based on assumptions, and the actual outcome will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based only on

known results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Certain risks are discussed in this Annual Report and also from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.

This Annual Report and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report.

This Annual Report is being filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as a late report to comply with the reporting obligations applicable to us under the Exchange Act. Unless specifically required to provide information for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the discussion of the business of the Company reflects its current assets and current operations. Where the information relates to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we have made a reasonable effort herein to make that clear. Also, to be clear, the financial information in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes accompanying this Annual Report and the other financial information and management's discussion about the consolidated financial statements relate to the periods for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

## Part I

## Item 1. Business

We operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. We operate a significant portion of the media businesses for Sports Illustrated (as defined below), own and operate TheStreet, Inc. (the "TheStreet"), and power more than 250 independent brands. The Maven technology platform (the "Maven Platform") provides digital publishing, distribution, and monetization capabilities for the Sports Illustrated and TheStreet businesses as well as a coalition of independent, professionally managed, online media publishers (each a "Publisher Partner"). Each Publisher Partner joins the media-coalition by invitation-only and is drawn from premium media brands and independent publishing businesses. Publisher Partners publish content and oversee an online community for their respective sites, leveraging our proprietary technology platform to engage the collective audiences within a single network. Generally, Publisher Partners are independently owned, strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. When they join, we believe Publisher Partners will benefit from the proprietary technology of the Maven Platform, techniques and relationships. Advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Publisher Partners onto a single platform and a large and experienced sales organization. They may also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue. Additionally, we believe the lead brand within each vertical creates a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners in the vertical while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While they benefit from these critical performance improvements they also may save substantially in costs of technology, infrastructure, advertising sales, and member marketing and management.

Please see " Our Future Business " and " Future Liquidity " for additional important information in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .

## Corporate History

We were originally incorporated in Delaware as Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. ("Integrated") in 1990. On July 22, 2016, Amplify Media, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware and on July 27, 2016, it changed its name to Amplify Media Network, Inc. ("Amplify Media Network"). Amplify Media Network changed its name again on October 14, 2016 to TheMaven Network, Inc. ("Maven Network").

On October 11, 2016, Integrated and Maven Network entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), whereby the stockholders of Maven Network agreed to exchange all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of common stock for shares of common stock of Integrated. On November 4, 2016, the parties consummated a recapitalization pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and, as a result, Maven Network became a wholly owned subsidiary of Integrated. Integrated changed its name to TheMaven, Inc. on December 2, 2016. On March 5, 2018, TheMaven Network changed its name to Maven Coalition, Inc. ("Maven Coalition 1").

## HubPages Merger

HubPages, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HubPages"), became our wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger, dated March 13, 2018 ("Agreement and Plan of Merger"), and as amended by the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 25, 2018 ("First Amendment"), the Second Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 1, 2018 ("Second Amendment"), the Third Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 31, 2019 ("Third Amendment"), and the Fourth Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 15, 2020 (the "Fourth Amendment" and, collectively with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Third Amendment, the "HubPages Merger Agreement") between us, HubPages, and HP Acquisition Co, Inc. ("HPAC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours incorporated in Delaware on March 13, 2018 in order to facilitate the acquisition of HubPages by us. Pursuant to the HubPages Merger Agreement, HPAC merged with and into HubPages, with HubPages continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the "HubPages Merger"). On August 23, 2018, we acquired all the outstanding shares of HubPages pursuant to the HubPages Merger.

## Say Media Merger

Say Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Say Media"), became our wholly owned subsidiary pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger, dated October 12, 2018 and as amended on October 17, 2018 (collectively, the "Say Media Merger Agreements") between us, Say Media, SM Acquisition Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SMAC"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ours incorporated on September 6, 2018 to facilitate a merger, and Matt Sanchez, solely in his capacity as a representative of the Say Media security holders. Pursuant to the Say Media Merger Agreement, SMAC merged with and into Say Media, with Say Media continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours (the "Say Media Merger"). On December 12, 2018, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Say Media pursuant to the Say Media Merger Agreements.

## Acquisition of TheStreet, Inc. and Relationship with Cramer Digital

TheStreet became our wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger, dated June 11, 2019, as amended (the "TheStreet Merger Agreement"), between us, Say Media, and TST Acquisition Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TSTAC"), a newly-formed indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours formed in order to facilitate the acquisition of TheStreet by us. Pursuant to TheStreet Merger Agreement, TSTAC merged with and into TheStreet, with TheStreet continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the "TheStreet Merger"). On August 7, 2019, we acquired all the outstanding shares of TheStreet pursuant to the TheStreet Merger.

On August 7, 2019, in connection with the TheStreet Merger, we entered into a letter agreement (the "Original Cramer Agreement") with finance and stock market expert Jim Cramer, who co-founded TheStreet, which sets forth the terms of the Cramer Services to be provided by Mr. Cramer and Cramer Digital, Inc. ("Cramer Digital"), a production company owned and controlled by Mr. Cramer, featuring the digital rights and content created by Mr. Cramer and his team of financial experts. A second letter agreement providing additional terms was entered into on April 16, 2020 (the "Second Cramer Agreement"). We entered into a third letter agreement on January 25, 2021, which extended the notice date to cancel the third year of the term of the Original Cramer Agreement from February 7, 2021 to April 9, 2021 (the

"Third Cramer Agreement" and, together with the Original Cramer Agreement and the Second Cramer Agreement, the "Cramer Agreement"). On April 6, 2021, Cramer Digital notified us that it would cancel the optional third year of the term of the Cramer Agreement and we and Cramer Digital commenced negotiation of a new contract. On August 7, 2021, we entered into an extension of the Cramer Agreement to provide Mr. Cramer's services through September 30, 2021. Further, we are in discussions about an ongoing relationship.

The Cramer Agreement provides for Mr. Cramer and Cramer Digital to create content for us on each business day during the term of the Cramer Agreement, prepare special content for us, make certain personal appearances and provide other services as reasonably requested and mutually agreed to (collectively, the "Cramer Services"). In consideration for the Cramer Services, we pay Cramer Digital a commission on subscription revenues and net advertising revenues for certain content (the "Revenue Share"). In addition, we pay Cramer Digital approximately $3,000,000 as an annualized guarantee payment in equal monthly draws, recoupable against the Revenue Share. We also issued two options to Cramer Digital pursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"). The first option was to purchase up to two million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.72, the closing stock price on August 7, 2019, the grant date. This option vests over 36 months. The second option was to purchase up to three million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.54, the closing stock price on April 21, 2020, the grant date. In the event Cramer Digital and we agree to renew the term of the Cramer Agreement for a minimum of three years from the end of the second year of the current term, 900,000 shares will vest on the first day of the third year of the term as so extended (the "Trigger Date"). The remaining shares will vest equally on the 12-month anniversary of the Trigger Date, the 24-month anniversary of the Trigger Date and the 36-month anniversary of the Trigger Date.

In addition, we provide Cramer Digital with a marketing budget, access to personnel and support services, and production facilities. Finally, the Cramer Agreement provides that we will reimburse fifty percent of the cost of the rented office space by Cramer Digital, up to a maximum of $4,250 per month.

## The Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement

On June 14, 2019, we entered into a licensing agreement (the "Initial Licensing Agreement"), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Licensing Agreement, dated September 1, 2019 (the "SI First Amendment"), Amendment No. 2 to Licensing Agreement, dated April 1, 2020 (the "SI Second Amendment"), Amendment No. 3 to Licensing Agreement, dated July 28, 2020 (the "SI Third Amendment"), Amendment No. 4 to Licensing Agreement, dated June 4, 2021 (the "SI Fourth Amendment"), and Side Letter, dated as of June 4, 2021 (the "SI Side Letter" and, together with the Initial Licensing Agreement, SI First Amendment, the SI Second Amendment, the SI Third Amendment, and the SI Fourth Amendment, the "Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement") with ABG-SI LLC ("ABG"), a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Authentic Brands Group, pursuant to which we have the exclusive right and license in the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand to operate the Sports Illustrated ("Sports Illustrated") media business (in the English and Spanish languages), including to (i) operate the digital and print editions of Sports Illustrated (including all special interest issues and the swimsuit issue) and Sports Illustrated for Kids , (ii) develop new digital media channels under the Sports Illustrated brands, and (iii) operate certain related businesses, including without limitation, special interest publications, video channels, bookazines, and the licensing and/or syndication of certain products and content under the Sports Illustrated brand (collectively, the "Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands").

The initial term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement commenced on October 4, 2019 upon the termination of the Meredith License Agreement (as defined below) and continues through December 31, 2029. We have the option, subject to certain conditions, to renew the term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement for nine consecutive renewal terms of 10 years each (collectively with the initial term, the "Term"), for a total of 100 years. The Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement provides that we will pay to ABG annual royalties in respect of each year of the Term based on gross revenues ("Royalties") with guaranteed minimum annual amounts. On the execution of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, we prepaid ABG $45,000,000 against future Royalties. ABG will pay to us a share of revenues relating to certain Sports Illustrated business lines not licensed to us, such as all gambling-related advertising and monetization, events, and commerce. The two companies are partnering in building the brand worldwide.

Pursuant to a publicly announced agreement, dated May 24, 2019, between ABG and Meredith Corporation ("Meredith"), an Iowa corporation, Meredith previously operated the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands under license from ABG (the "Meredith License Agreement"). On October 3, 2019, we, and Meredith entered into a Transition Services Agreement and an Outsourcing Agreement (collectively, the "Transition Agreement"), whereby the parties agreed to the terms and conditions under which Meredith continued to operate certain aspects of the business, and provided certain services during the fourth quarter of 2019 as all activities were transitioned over to us. Through these agreements, we took over operating control of the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands, and the Transition Agreement was terminated.

## Merger of Subsidiaries

On December 19, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Maven Coalition 1 and HubPages, were merged into another of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Say Media. On January 6, 2020, Say Media changed its name to Maven Coalition, Inc. (the "Maven Coalition").

## Asset Acquisition of Petametrics Inc.

On March 9, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Petametrics Inc., doing business as LiftIgniter, a Delaware corporation ("LiftIgniter"), and Maven Coalition, whereby Maven Coalition purchased substantially all the assets of LiftIgniter's machine learning platform, which personalizes content and product recommendations in real-time. The purchased assets included LiftIgniter's intellectual property and excluded certain accounts receivable. Maven Coalition also assumed certain of LiftIgniter's liabilities.

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CS Purchase Agreement, in exchange for The Spun Stock, Maven Media agreed to pay a purchase price, comprised of a cash payment of an aggregate of $11 million (the "Cash Payment") and the issuance of an aggregate of 4,285,714 restricted shares of our common stock (the "Stock Payment"), with one-half of the shares vesting on the first anniversary of the closing date and the remaining one-half of the shares vesting on the second anniversary of the closing date. The Cash Payment will be paid as follows: (i) on the closing date, a cash payment of $10 million; (ii) on the first anniversary of the closing date, a cash payment of $500,000; and (iii) on the second anniversary of the closing date, a cash payment of $500,000. The Cash Payment is subject to a customary working capital adjustment based on cash and accounts receivable targets of The Spun as of the closing. Further, the vesting of the Stock Payment held by the Seller Parties is subject to the continued employment of certain senior executives of The Spun.

## Capital Restructuring

On October 11, 2016, Integrated and Maven Network entered into the Share Exchange Agreement that provided for each outstanding share of common stock of Maven Network to be converted into 4.13607 shares of our common stock (the "Exchange Ratio"), and for each outstanding warrant and stock option to purchase shares of common stock of Maven Network be cancelled in exchange for a warrant or stock option to purchase shares of our common stock-based on the Exchange Ratio (the "Recapitalization").

Existing stock options to purchase 175,000 shares of our common stock were assumed pursuant to the Recapitalization.

## The Maven Technology Platform

We developed the Maven Platform, a proprietary online publishing platform that provides our owned and operated media businesses, Publisher Partners, whom are third parties producing and publishing content on their own domains, and individual creators contributing content to our owned and operated sites ("Expert Contributors"), the ability to produce and manage editorially focused content through tools and services provided by us. We have also developed proprietary advertising technology, techniques and relationships that allow us, our Publisher Partners and Expert Contributors to monetize online, editorially focused content through various display and video advertisements and tools and services for driving a subscription or membership based business and other monetization services (the "Monetization Solutions" and, together with the Maven Platform, the "Maven Platform Services").

The Maven Platform comprises state-of-the-art publishing tools, video platforms, commenting features, social distribution channels, newsletter technology, machine learning content recommendations, notifications and other technology, that deliver a complete set of features to drive a digital media business in an entirely cloud-based suite of services. Our software engineering and product development teams are experienced at delivering these services at scale. We continue to develop the Maven Platform software by combining proprietary code with components from the open-source community, plus select commercial services as well as identifying, acquiring, and integrating other platform technologies, where we see unique long-term benefits to us.

Our Platform Partners use the Maven Platform Services to produce, manage, host and monetize their content in accordance with the terms and conditions of partner agreements between each of our Publisher Partners and us (the "Partnership Agreements"). Pursuant to the Partnership Agreements, we and our Publisher Partners split revenue generated from the Maven Platform Services used in connection with the Publisher Partner's content based on certain metrics such as whether the revenue was from direct sales, was generated by our Publisher Partner or us, was generated in connection with a subscription or a membership, was based on standalone or bundled subscriptions or whether the revenue was derived from affiliate links.

Subject to the terms and conditions of each Partnership Agreement and in exchange for the Maven Platform Services, our Publisher Partners grant us, for so long as our Publisher Partner's assets are hosted on the Maven Platform, (i) exclusive control of ads.txt with respect to our Publisher Partner's domains and (ii) the exclusive right to include our Publisher Partner's website domains and related URLs in our coalition in a consolidated listing assembled by third party measurement companies such as comScore, Nielsen and/or other similar measuring services selected by us. As such, the Maven Platform serves as the primary digital media and social platform with respect to each of our Publisher Partners' website domains during the applicable term of each Partnership Agreement.

## Our Brands and Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to continue to expand the coalition by adding new Publisher Partners in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on the Maven Platform. In each vertical, we seek to build around a leading brand, such as Sports Illustrated (for sports) and TheStreet (for finance), surround it with subcategory specialists, and further enhance coverage with individual expert contributors. The primary means of expansion is adding independent Publisher Partners and/or acquiring publishers that have premium branded content and can broaden the reach and impact of the Maven Platform.

## Maven

We operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands. These brands range from niche media businesses to world-leading independent publishers, operating on the Maven Platform, a shared digital publishing, monetization, and distribution platform.

## Sports Illustrated

We assumed management of certain Sports Illustrated media assets (pursuant to the Sports Illustrated License Agreement) on October 4, 2019. Sports Illustrated is owned by ABG, a brand development, marketing, and entertainment company that owns a global portfolio of media, entertainment, and lifestyle brands. Since assuming management of the Sports Illustrated media assets, we have implemented significant changes to rebuild the historic brand and beacon of sports journalism, to evolve and expand the business, and to position it for growth and continued success going forward.

TheStreet is a leading financial news and information provider to investors and institutions worldwide and has produced business news and market analysis for individual investors for more than 20 years. TheStreet brings its editorial tradition, strong subscription platform, and valuable membership base to us, and benefits from our mobile-friendly CMS, social, video, and monetization technology.

Finance and stock market expert Jim Cramer, who co-founded TheStreet, and his team of financial experts continue their influential work with the brand. As part of the closing of the TheStreet Merger, we entered into the Cramer Agreement with Mr. Cramer, pursuant to which Mr. Cramer and his production company, Cramer Digital, provides the Cramer Services, including certain content offerings under Mr. Cramer's editorial control. On April 6, 2021, Cramer Digital notified us that it would cancel the optional third year of the term of the Cramer Agreement and we and Cramer Digital commenced negotiation of a new contract. On August 7, 2021, we entered into an extension of the Cramer Agreement to provide Mr. Cramer's services through September 30, 2021. Further, we are in discussions about an ongoing relationship.

## HubPages

We acquired HubPages to enhance the user's experience by increasing content, including from Expert Contributors. HubPages operates a network of 28 premium content channels that act as an open community for writers, explorers, knowledge seekers, and conversation starters to connect in an interactive and informative online space. HubPages operates in the United States.

## Say Media

We acquired Say Media to enhance the user's experience by increasing content. Now fully integrated into the Maven Platform, Say Media's technology provides a comprehensive online media publishing platform and enables brand advertisers to engage today's social media consumer through rich advertising experiences across its network of web properties. Say Media operated in the United States and previously maintained subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

## Our Publisher Partners and Licensing

In connection with our Partnership Agreements and any other applicable agreements between us and our Publisher Partners, (i) we and our affiliates own and retain (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Maven Platform, Monetization Solutions and data collected by us, and (b) we and our licensors' trademarks and branding and all software and technology we use to provide and operate the Maven Platform and Monetization Solutions, and (ii) each Publisher Partner owns and retains (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Publisher Partner's assets, content, and data collected by Publisher Partner and (b) each Publisher Partner's trademarks and branding.

## Seasonality

We expect to experience typical media company advertising and membership sales seasonality, which is strong in the fiscal fourth quarter and slower in the fiscal first quarter.

## Competition

Currently, we believe that there are dozens of competitors delivering niche media content on the web and on mobile devices and an even broader array of general media

companies and major media brands. All those competitors use mobile alerts, invest heavily in video, and leverage social media. We believe that we have developed distribution, production, and technology tactics that are superior because our management team's tactics in the past with prior companies have proven to be highly engaging and effective for our particular model, which organizes channels into interest groups, led by key brands, such as Sports Illustrated in the sports vertical and TheStreet in the finance vertical.

The web provides unlimited access to the market by niche or general media companies, so there are a large number and variety of direct competitors of ours competing for audience and ad and membership dollars. The general business of online media, combined with some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that will compete with us in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their markets more quickly and penetrate those market more effectively. The following is a list of possible competitors and their respective categories:

- โ Vice, Buzzfeed, Business Insider, et al. - niche content, leverages social, mobile, and video, and competes for ad dollars;

## 11

- โ Fortune, CNN, ESPN, Yahoo!, Google, et al. - general content, major media companies, and competes for ad dollars;
- โ WordPress, Medium, RebelMouse, Arc - content management software, open to all including experts and professionals, and competes for publishers;
- โ Leaf Group Ltd. and Future PLC - competes for partners and ad dollars;
- โ YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit - social platforms open to all including experts and professionals; and
- โ Affiliate networks such as Liberty Alliance - competes for ad dollars.

We believe that we compete on the basis of our technology, substantial scale in traffic, ease of use, recognized lead media brands, and platform evolution through a continuing development and acquisition program. We believe that our scale, methods, technology and experience enable us to compete for a material amount of market share of media dollars and membership revenue.

## Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to a number of United States federal and state laws and regulations that involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.

A number of government authorities, both in the United States and abroad, and private parties are increasing their focus on privacy issues and the use of personal information. All states have enacted some form of data privacy legislation, including data security and breach notification laws in all 50 states, and some form of regulation regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information at the federal level and in several states. California has been the most active in the area of consumer privacy legislation, including passing a comprehensive law requiring transparency, access, and choice known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA"), which was amended in November 2020 by a ballot measure known as the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"). The CCPA went into effect January 1, 2020, with enforcement having begun in June 2020. The CPRA goes into effect over time, with enforcement to begin July 2023. Other states are also considering comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. Certain states have also enacted legislation requiring certain encryption technologies for the storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and more states are considering laws for or have enacted laws about information security, which may require the adoption of written information security policies that are consistent with state laws if businesses have personal information of residents of those states. Data privacy and information security legislation is also being considered at the federal level, concerning the privacy of individuals and use of internet and marketing information. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and attorneys general in several states have oversight of business operations concerning the use of personal information and breaches of the privacy laws under existing consumer protection laws. In particular, an attorney general or the FTC may examine privacy policies to ensure that a company discloses all material practices and fully complies with representations in the policies regarding the manner in which the information provided by consumers and other visitors to a website is used and disclosed by it, and the failure to do so could give rise to a complaint under state or federal unfair competition or consumer protection laws. The California Attorney General has begun aggressively investigating companies, especially those with websites, with respect to CCPA compliance and these investigations reportedly include inquiries into issues for which there has not yet been clear guidance issued by the state, such as regarding third party cookies that collect personal information from users when they visit our and other websites.

12

We review our privacy policies and overall operations on a regular basis to ensure compliance with applicable United States federal and state laws, and to the extent applicable, any foreign laws. We launched a CCPA compliance program in January 2020 and at the end of 2020 reviewed the program and made adjustments to our privacy notice and compliance program practices to account for our evolving practices and the new CCPA regulations, which were promulgated in July 2020 and continue to be subject to ongoing rulemaking. We believe the position we take regarding various CCPA issues, including third party cookies, is based on sound and good faith interpretations of the law based on consultation with legal counsel. However, there are conflicting interpretations of the law that have been adopted by various parties in the digital media industry, and given the lack of guidance to date on many of these issues, our compliance posture on some issues might not be accepted by the State of California.

In addition to the laws of the United States, we may be subject to foreign laws regulating web sites and online services, and the laws in some jurisdictions outside of the United States are stricter than the laws in the United States. For instance, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") went into effect in the EU and European Economic Area and Switzerland. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU that include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some EU countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing additional data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of personal data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. How the GDPR will be fully applied to online services, including cookies and digital advertising, is still being determined through ongoing rulemaking and evolving interpretation by applicable authorities. We operate a GDPR compliance program that we believe, based on our good faith interpretation of the GDPR in consultation with counsel, is consistent with our obligations under that law. The highest court in the EU recently ruled that the United States/EU Privacy Shield was inadequate under GDPR and questioned the viability or legality of any EU to United States personal data transfer methods. We are working to address this issue, for instance, including standard contractual clauses as part of our Data Processing Agreements, and we continue to monitor the development of EU to United States personal data transfer methods and the law relating thereto.

Social networking websites are under increasing scrutiny. Legislation has been introduced on the state and federal level that could regulate social networking websites. Some rules call for more stringent age-verification techniques, attempt to mandate data retention or data destruction by Internet providers, and impose civil and/or criminal penalties on owners or operators of social networking websites.

The FTC regularly considers issues relating to online behavioral advertising (a/k/a interest-based advertising), which is a significant revenue source for us, and Congress and state legislatures are frequently asked to regulate this type of advertising, including requiring consumers to provide express consent for tracking purposes, so that advertisers may know their interests and are, therefore, able to serve them more relevant, targeted ads. Targeted ads generate higher per impression fees than non-

targeted ads. New laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could potentially place restrictions on our ability to utilize our database and other marketing data (e.g., from third parties) on our own behalf and on behalf of our advertising clients, which may adversely affect our business.

Legislation concerning the above described online activities has either been enacted or is in various stages of development and implementation in other countries around the world and could affect our ability to make our websites available in those countries as future legislation is made effective. It is possible that state and foreign governments might also attempt to regulate our transmissions of content on our website or prosecute us for violations of their laws. United States law offers limited safe harbors and immunities to publishers for certain liability arising out of user-posted content, but other countries do not. Further, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, and internationally, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties and liability for defamation or other claims arising out of user-posted content. Our business could be negatively impacted if applicable laws subject us to greater regulation or risk of liability.

13

Our business could also be adversely affected if regulatory enforcement authorities, such as the California Attorney General or EU/EEA data protection authorities, take issue with any of our approaches to compliance, or if new laws, regulations or decisions regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and/or disclosure of personal information are implemented in such ways that impose new or additional technology requirements on us, limit our ability to collect, transmit, store and use or disclose the information, or if government authorities or private parties challenge our data privacy and/or security practices that result in liability to, or restrictions, on us, or we experience a significant data or information breach which would require public disclosure under existing notification laws and for which we may be liable for damages and/or penalties.

Furthermore, governments of applicable jurisdictions might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities even though we do not have a physical presence and/or operate in those jurisdictions. As our platforms, products and advertisement activities are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of those jurisdictions and pay various taxes in those jurisdictions. We address state and local jurisdictions where we believe we have nexus, however, there can be no assurance that we have complied with all jurisdictions that may assert that we owe taxes.

## Employees

Our total number of employees as of June 30, 2021 was 328, of which 290 were full-time employees.

## Available Information

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge after we electronically file or furnish them to the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

There are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer. As a result, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the section entitled "Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."

## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19"). An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and has spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the world. Many national governments and sports authorities around the world made the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance sports events in an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In addition, many governments and businesses limited non-essential work activity, furloughed, and/or terminated many employees and closed some operations and/or locations, all of which has had a negative impact on the economic environment.

14

Beginning in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue and earnings began to decline largely due to the cancellation of high attendance sports events and the resulting decrease in traffic to the Maven Platform and advertising revenue. This initial decrease in revenue and earnings were partially offset by revenues generated by TheStreet, as well as some recovery of sporting events (including, in some cases, limited in-person attendance) that have generated content for the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands. Through the spring of 2021, we have increasingly seen sports leagues and events return to pre-pandemic scheduling, as well as additional lifting of restrictions on in-person attendance at sporting events, which have continued to result in some recovery of our operational and financial performance. Despite this initial recovery, the future impact, or continued impact, from the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain.

The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend, in part, on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other pandemics or epidemics, could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report under the "Risk Factors" section.

Because of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty about their persistence, we may need to raise more capital to continue operations. At December 31, 2020, we had cash of approximately $9.0 million. From January 1, 2021 through the issuance date of our accompany consolidated financial statements, we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $19.6 million through private placements of our common stock, of which approximately $11 million was applied to the cash portion of the purchase of The Spun. As of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were issued or were available to be issued, we had cash of approximately $7.5 million. Please refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , under the section entitled "Future Liquidity," for additional information. We have seen stabilization in our markets since May of 2020 and believe that based on our current assessment of the impact of COVID-19, we have sufficient resources to fully fund our business operations through 12 months from the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements. However, due to the continuing uncertainty regarding the duration of the impact of COVID-19 and its effect on our financial performance and the potential that our traffic and advertising revenue becomes destabilized again, we may require additional capital. We have not had difficulties accessing the capital markets during 2020 and 2021, however, due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we may experience difficulties in the future.

As market conditions present uncertainty as to our ability to secure additional capital, there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue to conduct operations. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our offerings and competing technological and market developments. We may need to raise funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that such funding, will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, any equity financing will be dilutive to existing stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility with respect to certain business matters. Strategic arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights or grant licenses to some or substantial parts of our intellectual property. If funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share, and such equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of our existing capital stock. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue operating, develop or enhance products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

15

We have incurred losses since our inception, have yet to achieve profitable operations, and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have had losses from inception, and as a result, have relied on capital funding or borrowings to fund our operations. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $162.1 million. We have not issued our financial statements for any periods during fiscal 2021. While we anticipate generating positive cash flow in fiscal 2021, the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic yields some doubt as to our ability to do so and could require us to raise additional capital. We cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to find capital to support our business plan if the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue longer than anticipated.

We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we do not adequately address these material weaknesses or if other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered, our financial statements could contain material misstatements and our business, operations and stock price may be adversely affected. As disclosed under Item 9A, Controls and Procedures , of this Annual Report, our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2020 and we expect to continue to have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting at March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. We expect to have remediated our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting by December 31, 2021, of which there can be no assurance. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although no material misstatement of our historical financial statements was identified, the existence of these material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and we could be required to restate our financial statements. Further, significant costs and resources may be needed to remediate the identified material weaknesses or any other material weaknesses or internal control deficiencies. If we are unable to remediate, evaluate, and test our internal controls on a timely basis in the future, management will be unable to conclude that our internal controls are effective and our independent registered public accounting firm will be unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, the price of our common stock could be adversely impacted and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

As of the date of filing this Annual Report, we currently lack certain internal controls over our financial reporting. While we have three independent directors serving on our board of directors (our "Board"), have added to our accounting staff, and have hired a new Chief Technology Officer, we are implementing such controls at this time. The lack of such controls makes it difficult to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and implement the necessary internal controls over financial reporting. The absence of such internal controls may inhibit investors from purchasing our shares and may make it more difficult for us to raise debt or equity financing.

If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with the Maven Platform, our business would be seriously harmed. The success of our business heavily depends on the size of our user base and the level of engagement of our users. Thus, our business performance will also become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement in existing and new markets. We are continuously subject to a highly competitive market in order to attract and retain our users' attention. A number of factors could negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:

- โ users increasingly engage with competing platforms instead of ours;
- โ we fail to introduce new and exciting products and services, or such products and services do not achieve a high level of market acceptance;
- โ we fail to accurately anticipate consumer needs, or we fail to innovate and develop new software and products that meet these needs;

16

- โ we fail to price our products competitively;
- โ we do not provide a compelling user experience because of the decisions we make regarding the type and frequency of advertisements that we display;
- โ we are unable to combat spam, bugs, malwares, viruses, hacking, or other hostile or inappropriate usage on our products;
- โ there are changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products in the short-term, long-term, or both;
- โ there are increased user concerns related to privacy and information sharing, safety, or security;
- โ there are adverse changes in our products or services that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or legal proceedings;
- โ technical or other problems frustrate the user experience, particularly if those problems prevent us from delivering our products in a fast and reliable manner;
- โ we, our Publisher Partners, or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, some of which may be inaccurate or include confidential information that we are unable to correct or retract; or
- โ we fail to maintain our brand image or our reputation is damaged.

Any decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, advertisers, or our Publisher Partners, thereby reducing our revenues from them, which may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in developing products and services that eventually become widely accepted, that we will be able to timely release products and services that are commercially viable, or that we will establish ourselves as a successful player in a new business area. Our inability to do so would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The digital media industry

is fragmented and highly competitive. There are many players in the digital media market, many with greater name recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. Some of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer, and user requirements and trends. In addition, our customers and strategic partners may become competitors in the future. Certain of our competitors may be able to negotiate alliances with strategic partners on more favorable terms than we are able to negotiate. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of the Maven Platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. With the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of the Maven Platform, and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.

We may have difficulty managing our growth. We have added, and expect to continue to add, publisher partner and end-user support capabilities, to continue software development activities, and to expand our administrative operations. In the past two years, we have entered into multiple strategic transactions. These strategic transactions, which have significantly expanded our business, have and are expected to place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, and financial resources. To manage any further growth, we will be required to improve existing, and implement new, operational, customer service, and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train, and manage our growing employee base. We also will be required to expand our finance, administrative, technical, and operations staff. There can be no assurance that our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support our anticipated growth, that management will be able to hire, train, retain, motivate, and manage required personnel or that our management will be able to successfully identify, manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.

The strategic relationships that we may be able to develop and on which we may come to rely may not be successful. We will seek to develop strategic relationships with advertising, media, technology, and other companies to enhance the efforts of our market penetration, business development, and advertising sales revenues. These relationships are expected to, but may not, succeed. There can be no assurance that these relationships will develop and mature, or that potential competitors will not develop more substantial relationships with attractive partners. Our inability to successfully implement our strategy of building valuable strategic relationships could harm our business.

We rely heavily on our ability to collect and disclose data and metrics in order to attract new advertisers and retain existing advertisers. Any restriction, whether by law, regulation, policy, or other reason, on our ability to collect and disclose data that our advertisers find useful would impede our ability to attract and retain advertisers. Our advertising revenue could be seriously harmed by many other factors, including:

- โ a decrease in the number of active users of the Maven Platform;
- โ our inability to create new products that sustain or increase the value of our advertisements;
- โ our inability to increase the relevance of targeted advertisements shown to users;
- โ adverse legal developments relating to advertising, including changes mandated by legislation, regulation, or litigation; and
- โ difficulty and frustration from advertisers who may need to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines.

The occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for advertisements, which may reduce the prices we receive for our advertisements or cause advertisers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The sales and payment cycle for online advertising is long, and such sales, which have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may not occur when anticipated or at all. The decision process is typically lengthy for brand advertisers and sponsors to commit to online campaigns. Some of their budgets are planned a full year in advance. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the amount and pricing of advertising throughout the media industry and it is uncertain when and to what extent advertisers will return to more normal spending levels. The decision process for such purchases, even in normal business situations, is subject to delays and aspects that are beyond our control. In addition, some advertisers and sponsors take months after the campaign runs to pay, and some may not pay at all, or require partial "make-goods" based on performance.

18

We are dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our key executive officers, management team, and other key personnel, the loss of which could adversely affect our business. Our future success largely depends upon the continued services of our key executive officers, management team, and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We depend on the continued services of our key personnel as they work closely with both our employees and our Publisher Partners. Such key personnel are also responsible for our day-to-day operations. Although we have employment agreements with some of our key personnel, these are at-will employment agreements, albeit with noncompetition and confidentiality provisions and other rights typically associated with employment agreements. We do not believe that any of our executive officers are planning to leave or retire in the near term; however, we cannot assure that our executive officers or members of our management team will remain with us. We also depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, operational, business development, and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers, members of our management team, or key personnel, including our regional and country managers, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We are dependent on the continued services and on the performance of key third party content contributors, the loss of which could adversely affect our business. We rely on content contributed by third party providers, which has in turn attracted users that drive advertising and subscription revenue. The loss of the services of any of such key contributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we have service agreements with some of our key contributors, many are short term in nature or have cancelation clauses in the agreements. We also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain, other highly skilled third-party content contributors. Competition for such contributors is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate, or retain them. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our key third party contributors, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified key contributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our revenues could decrease if the Maven Platform does not continue to operate as intended. The Maven Platform performs complex functions and is vulnerable to undetected errors or unforeseen defects that could result in a failure to operate or inefficiency. There can be no assurance that errors and defects will not be found in current or new products or, if discovered, that we will be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all. The occurrence of errors and defects could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of market share, increased development costs, diversion of development resources and injury to our reputation or damage to our efforts to expand brand awareness.

Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business and operating results. Our growth will depend in part on the ability of our users and Publisher Partners to access the Maven Platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. We believe that the Maven Platform is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations, and software development teams for their continued performance. It is possible that the Maven Platform may experience performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing the Maven Platform software simultaneously, denial of service attacks, or other security related incidents. We may not be able to identify the cause or causes of any performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may be that it will be difficult to maintain and/or improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as the Maven Platform becomes more complex and our user traffic increases. If the Maven Platform software is unavailable or if our users are unable to access it within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business would be negatively affected. Therefore, in the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure, partner or user data may be permanently lost. Moreover, the Partnership Agreements with our Publisher Partners include service level standards that obligate us to provide credits or termination rights in the event of a significant disruption in the Maven Platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.

19

We operate our exclusive coalition of professional-managed online media channels on third party cloud platforms and data center hosting facilities. We rely on software and services licensed from, and cloud platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our digital media services. Any errors or defects in third-party software or cloud platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our digital media services, which could harm our business. Any damage to, or failure of, these thirdparty systems generally could result in interruptions in the availability of our digital media services. As a result of this third-party reliance, we may experience the aforementioned issues, which could cause us to render credits or pay penalties, could cause our Publisher Partners to terminate their contractual arrangements with us, and could adversely affect our ability to grow our audience of unique visitors, all of which could reduce our ability to generate revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our users and potential users believe our product and services offerings are unreliable. In the event of damage to, or failure of, these third-party systems, we would need to identify alternative channels for the offering of our digital media services, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. We are also subject to certain standard terms and conditions with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud related to data storage purposes. These providers have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. Therefore, we believe that maintaining successful partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and other third-party suppliers is critical to our success.

Real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in the Maven Platform could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. Because the Maven Platform is complex, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may occur, especially when updates are deployed. Despite testing by us, errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may not be found in the Maven Platform until after they are deployed to our customers. We expect from time to time to discover software errors, failures, vulnerabilities, and bugs in the Maven Platform and anticipate that certain of these errors, failures, vulnerabilities, and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after deployment to our Publisher Partners and used by subscribers. Real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our software could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of the Maven Platform, loss of competitive position, or claims by our Publisher Partners or subscribers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.

Malware, viruses, hacking attacks, and improper or illegal use of the Maven Platform could harm our business and results of operations. Malware, viruses, and hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware, or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to detect such attack and maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may also seriously harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users.

Our information technology systems are susceptible to a growing and evolving threat of cybersecurity risk. Any substantial compromise of our data security, whether externally or internally, or misuse of agent, customer, or employee data, could cause considerable damage to our reputation, cause the public disclosure of confidential information, and result in lost sales, significant costs, and litigation, which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Although we maintain policies and processes surrounding the protection of sensitive data, which we believe to be adequate, there can be no assurances that we will not be subject to such claims in the future.

20

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could suffer. Our success significantly depends on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technology. However, these only afford limited protection, and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Maven Platform's features and functionality, or to use information that we consider proprietary or confidential. There can be no assurance that the Maven Platform will be protectable by patents, but if they are, any efforts to obtain patent protection that is not successful may harm our business in that others will be able to use our technologies. For example, previous disclosures or activities unknown at present may be uncovered in the future and adversely impact any patent rights that we may obtain. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights, and similar proprietary rights. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, those proceedings could be expensive and time-consuming and could distract our management from our business operations. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we fail to receive adequate protection of our proprietary rights.

We could be required to cease certain activities and/or incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party's intellectual property rights. Some of our competitors, and other third parties, may own technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and website content, which they may use to assert claims against us. We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to claims that we have misappropriated or misused other parties' intellectual property rights. Any claim or litigation alleging that we have infringed or otherwise violated intellectual property or other rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not settled out of court or determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.

The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party may require us to do one or more of the following:

- โ cease making, selling, offering, or using technologies or products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
- โ make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages;
- โ obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or
- โ redesign technology to avoid infringement.

If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.

21

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection, and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal

information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, employee classification, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, monetary penalties or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted or applied in ways that could limit or harm our business, require us to make certain fundamental and potentially detrimental changes to the products and services we offer, or subject us to claims. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third-parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright, and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition, there have been calls by members of Congress, from both parties, to limit the scope of the current immunities and safe harbors afforded online publishers with regard to user content and communications under the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the federal Communications Decency Act. Any material reduction of those protections would make us more vulnerable to third party claims arising out of user content published by our online services.

These United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change, which could adversely affect our business. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. Any change in legislation and regulations could affect our business. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.

Furthermore, significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations. Violations may result from:

- โ ambiguity in statutes;
- โ regulations and related court decisions;
- โ the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws;
- โ new regulations affecting our business; and
- โ changes to, or interpretations of, existing regulations affecting our business.

While we prioritize ensuring that our business and compensation model are compliant, and that any product or income related claims are truthful and non-deceptive, we cannot be certain that the FTC or similar regulatory body in another country will not modify or otherwise amend its guidance, laws, or regulations or interpret in a way that would render our current practices inconsistent with the same.

22

Our services involve the storage and transmission of digital information; therefore, cybersecurity incidents, including those caused by unintentional errors and those intentionally caused by third parties, may expose us to a risk of loss, unauthorized disclosure or other misuse of this information, litigation liability and regulatory exposure, reputational harm and increased security costs. We and our third-party service providers experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. We expect to incur significant costs in ongoing efforts to detect and prevent cybersecurity-related incidents and these costs may increase in the event of an actual or perceived data breach or other cybersecurity incident. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased opportunities for cyber-criminals and the risk of potential cybersecurity incidents, as more companies and individuals work online. We cannot ensure that our efforts to prevent cybersecurity incidents will succeed. An actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity could impact the market perception of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls. If our users or business partners, including our Publisher Partners, are harmed by such an incident, they could lose trust and confidence in us, decrease their use of our services or stop using them in entirely. We could also incur significant legal and financial exposure, including legal claims, higher transaction fees and regulatory fines and penalties, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these types of matters, a significant cybersecurity incident could subject us to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage.

Prior employers of our employees may assert violations of past employment arrangements. Our employees are highly experienced, having worked in our industry for many years. Prior employers may try to assert that our employees are breaching restrictive covenants and other limitations imposed by past employment arrangements. We believe that all of our employees are free to work for us in their various capacities and have not breached past employment arrangements. Notwithstanding our care in our employment practices, a prior employer may assert a claim. Such claims will be costly to contest, highly disruptive to our work environment, and may be detrimental to our operations.

Our products may require availability of components or known technology from third parties and their non-availability can impede our growth. We license/buy certain technology integral to our products from third parties, including open-source and commercially available software. Our inability to acquire and maintain any third-party product licenses or integrate the related third-party products into our products in compliance with license arrangements, could result in delays in product development until equivalent products can be identified, licensed, and integrated. We also expect to require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves. We cannot provide assurance that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Government regulations may increase our costs of doing business. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to online media, communities, commerce, security and privacy could harm our business, operating results and financial condition by increasing our costs and administrative burdens. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, security, libel, consumer protection, and taxation apply. Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet activities are becoming more diverse and prevalent in all global markets. We must comply with regulations in the United States, as well as any other regulations adopted by other countries where we may do business. The growth and development of Internet content, commerce and communities may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, privacy laws and data protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, as well as new laws governing the taxation of these activities. Compliance with any newly adopted laws may prove difficult for us and may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We may face lawsuits or incur liabilities in the future in connection with our businesses. In the future, we may face lawsuits or incur liabilities in connection with our businesses. For example, we could face claims relating to information that is published or made available on the Maven Platform. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, intellectual property rights and rights of publicity and privacy. We might not be able to monitor or edit a significant portion of the content that appears on the Maven Platform. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. If any of these events occur, our business could be seriously harmed.

## RISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES

There may be no liquid market for our common stock. We provide no assurances of any kind or nature whatsoever that an active market for our common stock will

ever develop. There has been no sustained activity in the market for our common stock. Investors should understand that there may be no alternative exit strategy for them to recover or liquidate their investments in our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to bear the entire economic risk of an investment in us for an indefinite period of time. Even if an active trading market develops over time, we cannot predict how liquid that market might become. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group, Inc.'s (the "OTCM") Pink Open Market (the "OTC Pink"). Trading in stock quoted on over-the-counter markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:

- โ Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;
- โ Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products and services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;
- โ Disruption or substantive changes to our operations, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
- โ Variations in our sales and earnings from period to period;
- โ Commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;
- โ Any major change in our board or management;
- โ Changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals; and
- โ General market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our own operating performance.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the United States securities laws, which will require expenditure of capital and other resources, and may divert management's attention. We are a public reporting company subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("Sarbanes"), and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations have caused us and will continue to cause us to incur additional legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, be time-consuming or costly, and continue to increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. We are not current in our SEC filings and the cost of completing historical filings in addition to maintaining current financial reporting has been, and will continue to be, a financial burden for us. If we fail to or are unable to comply with Sarbanes, we will not be able to obtain independent accountant certifications that Sarbanes requires publicly traded companies to obtain. Further, by complying with public disclosure requirements, our business and financial condition are more visible, which we believe may result in the likelihood of increased threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. Compliance with these additional requirements may also divert management's attention from operating our business. Any of these may adversely affect our operating results.

We may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms or securities analysts in our efforts to raise capital. In due course, we plan to seek to have our common stock quoted on a national securities exchange in the United States. There can be no assurance that we will be able to garner a quote for our common stock on an exchange. Even if we are successful in doing so, security analysts and major brokerage houses may not provide coverage of us. We may also not be able to attract any brokerage houses to conduct secondary offerings with respect to our securities.

24

Because we are subject to the "penny stock" rules and regulations, the level of trading activity in our common stock is limited, and our stockholders may have difficulties selling their shares. SEC regulations define penny stocks to be any non-exchange equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. The regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Exchange Act require additional disclosure relating to the market for penny stocks in connection with trades in any stock defined as a penny stock. Unless an exception is available, those regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a standardized risk disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC, to provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the purchaser's account, to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage market investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rules. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the penny stock rules, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.

In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock.

Not Applicable.

## Item 2. Properties

On April 25, 2018, we entered into an office sublease agreement (the "1500 Fourth Ave Sublease") to sublease a portion of the "master premises" consisting of 7,457 rentable square feet of office space for our then-executive offices at 1500 Fourth Avenue, Suite 200, Seattle, Washington 98101. The 1500 Fourth Ave Sublease commenced on June 1, 2018 with an expiration date of October 31, 2021. The amount of monthly rent payable per square foot under the 1500 Fourth Ave Sublease was $25.95 for the first year, $35.00 for the second year, $36.00 for the third year, and $37.00 for the remainder of the term. On March 1, 2020, we assumed the entire lease for the remaining term of 20 months.

On September 19, 2018, we entered into a membership agreement with WeWork for office space located at 995 Market Street, San Francisco, California. The agreement commenced on October 1, 2018. We paid approximately $17,400 per month, which included certain conference room credits and printer credits. We also paid a service retainer in the amount of $26,100. We terminated our membership agreement effective October 31, 2020.

On December 12, 2018, as part of our acquisition of Say Media, we assumed the office lease (the "Portland Lease") of 10,000 rentable square feet at 424 SW Fourth Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97204. The Portland Lease began on July 1, 2015, and expired June 30, 2020. Monthly lease payments increased from $18,750 in July 2015 to $27,500 in June 2020.

On August 7, 2019, as part of its acquisition of TheStreet, we assumed the office lease of approximately 35,000 rentable square feet at 14 Wall Street, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10005. The lease had a remaining term of 16 months, expiring on December 31, 2020. Monthly lease payments from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020 were $150,396. On October 30, 2020, we entered into a surrender agreement (the "Surrender Agreement") pursuant to which we effectively surrendered the property back to the owner and landlord. Pursuant to the Surrender Agreement, we agreed to pay $68,868 per month from January 2021 through June 1, 2022 to satisfy the total outstanding balance of $1,239,626 owed to the lessor. The first $500,000 of payments was drawn from a security deposit, which is held by the lessor. The lessor agreed not to charge any late fees, interest charges, or other penalties relating to the surrender of the property.

Effective October 1, 2019, we entered into an office lease (the "Santa Monica Lease") of approximately 5,258 rentable square feet at 301 Arizona Avenue, 4th Floor, Santa Monica, California 90401. The Santa Monica Lease has a term of 5 years, expiring on September 30, 2024. The initial monthly rent was $36,806 and increased to $37,910 in October 2020.

Effective October 3, 2019, we entered into a condominium lease (the "Washington Square Lease") of a multifamily townhome at 26 Washington Square North, New York, New York 10011. The Washington Square Lease had a term of one year, expiring on October 2, 2020, with monthly rent payments of $10,000. This property was used by our executive officers when they were in New York for matters related to our business. We terminated this lease in March 2020 when we entered into the 30 West Lease (as defined below).

On January 14, 2020, we entered into an office sublease agreement (the "Liberty Street Sublease") of approximately 40,868 rentable square feet at 225 Liberty Street, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10281, with an effective date of February 1, 2020 with lease payments commencing November 1, 2020 and expiring on November 30, 2032. Monthly lease payments from November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2025 are $252,019.

Effective March 1, 2020, we entered into a corporate apartment lease (the "30 West Lease") at 30 West Street, New York, New York 10004. The 30 West Lease has a term of 18 months, expiring on August 31, 2021, with monthly lease payments of $8,000 through February 2021 and $8,500 from March 2021 through the expiration of the lease. We terminated this lease in December 2020.

We believe that the rates we are paying under our property leases are competitive in our various real estate markets, and we would be able to find comparable lease properties in the event we changed locations.

## Overview

We operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands. The Maven Platform provides digital publishing, distribution and monetization capabilities to our own Sports Illustrated and TheStreet media businesses as well as to the Publisher Partners. Generally, the Publisher Partners are independently owned strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems to further enhance their revenue.

Our growth strategy is to continue to expand by adding new premium publishers with high quality brands and content either as independent Publisher Partners or by acquiring publishers as owned and operated entities. By adding premium content brands, we will further expand the scale of the Maven Platform, improve monetization effectiveness in both advertising and subscription revenues, and enhance the attractiveness to consumers and advertisers.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of approximately $9.0 million. In addition, we had the use of additional proceeds from our working capital facility with FPP Finance LLC ("FastPay"), As of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had also received proceeds from a private placement of our common stock of approximately $20.0 million, which is discussed in greater detail below in the section entitled "Future Liquidity."

We continued to be focused on growing our existing operations and seeking accretive and complementary strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We believed, that with additional sources of liquidity and the ability to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement our then internal projections, we would be able to execute our growth plan and finance our working capital requirements.

We have financed our working capital requirements since inception through issuances of equity securities and various debt financings. Our working capital deficit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:

on amounts outstanding under the existing 12% senior secured notes with respect to (i) interest that was payable on such notes on March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and (ii) at our option, with the consent of requisite purchasers, interest that was payable on September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in lieu of the payment in cash of all or any portion of the interest due on such dates, would be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter.

On October 23, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second A&R NPA with BRF Finance ("Amendment 1"), pursuant to which the maturity date of the 12% senior secured notes was changed to December 31, 2022 or an earlier date if the obligations have been accelerated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Amendment 1. Pursuant to Amendment 1, interest payable on the existing 12% senior secured notes on September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021 will be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Alternatively, at the option of the holder, such interest amounts originally could have been paid in shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock, all such interest amounts can be paid in shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments.

On May 19, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Second A&R NPA ("Amendment 2") with BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers and as purchaser, which further amended the 12% senior secured notes. Pursuant to Amendment 2: (i) the interest rate on the 12% senior secured notes decreased from a rate of 12% per annum to a rate of 10% per annum; (ii) the interest rate on the Term Note decreased from a rate of 15% per annum to a rate of 10% per annum; and (iii) we agreed that within one (1) business day after receipt of cash proceeds from any issuance of equity interests, we would prepay the certain obligations in an amount equal to such cash proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions; provided, that, this mandatory prepayment obligation did not apply to any proceeds that we received from the sale and issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the securities purchase agreement during the 90-day period commencing on May 20, 2021.

The balance outstanding under our amended and restated 12% senior secured notes as of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $59.6 million, which included outstanding principal of approximately $48.8 million, payment of in-kind interest of approximately $7.5 million that we were permitted to add to the aggregate outstanding principal balance, and unpaid accrued interest of approximately $0.4 million).

Delayed Draw Term Note. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, we agreed to issue, at BRF Finance's option, the Term Note, in the aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million to the investor. On March 24, 2020, we drew down approximately $6.9 million under the Term Note, and after payment of commitment and funding fees paid to BRF Finance in the amount of approximately $0.7 million, and other of its legal fees and expenses that we incurred, we received net proceeds of $6.0 million. The net proceeds were used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. Additional borrowings under the Term Note requested by us may be made at the option of the purchasers. Up to $8.0 million in principal amount under the Term Note was originally due on March 31, 2021. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Note was payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter.

Pursuant to the terms of Amendment 1, the maturity date was changed from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Amendment 1 also provided that BRF Finance, as holder, could originally elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for payment of all or any portion of the interest due or cash payments up to the Conversion Portion (as defined in Amendment 1) of the Term Note, to receive shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of our common stock, the holder may elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for such amounts, shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments.

On October 23, 2020, approximately $3.4 million, including approximately $3.3 million of principal amount of the Term Note and approximately $0.7 million of accrued interest, had been converted into shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Note as of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $4.7 million (including payment of in-kind interest of approximately $1.1 million, which was added to the outstanding Term Note balance).

Pursuant to the terms of Amendment 2, the interest rate on the Term Note decreased from a rate of 15% per annum to a rate of 10% per annum.

Paycheck Protection Program Loan. On April 6, 2020, we issued a note in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to the recently enacted CARES Act administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA"). We received total proceeds of approximately $5.7 million under the note. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we used the proceeds from the note primarily for payroll costs. The note was scheduled to mature on April 6, 2022, had a 0.98% interest rate and was subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $5.7 million.

Pursuant to the CARES Act, the note was eligible for partial forgiveness for the principal amounts that were used for the limited purposes that qualified for forgiveness under SBA requirements. In order to obtain forgiveness, we requested such forgiveness, provided the requisite documentation in accordance with the SBA requirements, and certified that the amounts we were requesting to be forgiven qualified under those requirements. On June 22, 2021, we received notification from the SBA that our loan was fully forgiven.

12% Convertible Debentures. On December 31, 2020, noteholders converted the 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into 53,887,470 shares of our common stock at effective conversion per-share prices ranging from $0.33 to $0.40. Despite the terms of the 12% convertible debentures, the noteholders agreed to allow us to repay accrued but unpaid interest in shares of our common stock. The remaining 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to the noteholders.

## Future Liquidity

Our consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had revenues of approximately $128.0 million during fiscal 2020 and have experienced recurring net losses from operations and negative operating cash flows. Consequently, we were dependent upon continued access to funding and capital resources from both new investors and related parties. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our growth plan and plan of operations. These financings may include terms that may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.

From January 1, 2021 to the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to incur operating losses and negative cash flow from operating and investing activities. We have raised $20.0 million in net proceeds pursuant to the sale of shares of our common stock. Our cash balance as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were issued or were available to be issued was approximately $13.9 million. Net proceeds from issuances of our common stock (as further described in Note 27, Subsequent Events , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements) consisted of the following:

On May 20 and 25, 2021, we entered into securities purchase agreements with several accredited investors, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 21,435,718 shares of our common stock, at a per share price of $0.70, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $15.0 million in a private placement. On June 2, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 7,142,857 shares of our common stock, at a per share price of $0.70, for gross proceeds of approximately $5.0 million in a private placement that was in addition to the two earlier closing that occurred on May 20 and 25, 2021. We

intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

## Going Concern

We performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. This Annual Report has been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

We have had a history of recurring losses. Our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet its obligations when due. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of the impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related shut down of most professional and collegiate sports, which reduced user traffic and advertising revenue. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a marketing investment in customer growth, together with investment in people and technology as we continued to expand our operations, and operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2019 with the TheStreet Merger and the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement.

As reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had revenues of approximately $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative working capital and negative operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $104.7 million, utilized cash in operating activities of approximately $32.3 million, and as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $162.1 million. We have financed our working capital requirements since inception through the issuance of debt and equity securities.

33

The negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021 has been to a lesser extent than in 2020.Beginning in 2021, restrictions on non-essential work activity have begun to lift and sporting and other events have begun to be held, with attendance closer to pre-pandemic levels, which has resulted in an increase in traffic to the Maven Platform and, thereby an increase in advertising revenue. The ultimate extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions will be put in place again, and the extent and effectiveness of containment and other actions taken, including the percentage of the population that receives COVID-19 vaccinations, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Management has evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management's assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were issued or were available to be issued.

Management's assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. The factors that we considered important in its going concern analysis, include, but are not limited to, our fiscal 2021 cash flow forecast and our fiscal 2021 operating budget. Management also considered our implementation of additional measures, if required, related to potential revenue and earnings declines from COVID-19. These factors consider information including, but not limited to, our financial condition, liquidity sources, obligations due within one year after the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements, the funds necessary to maintain operations and financial conditions, including negative financial trends or other indicators of possible financial difficulty.

In particular, our plan for the: (1) 2021 cash flow forecast, considered the use of our working capital line with FastPay (as described in Note 19, Long-term Debt , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements) to fund changes in working capital, under which we have available credit of approximately $8.5 million as of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, and that we do not anticipate the need for any further borrowings that are subject to the approval of the holders of the Term Note (as described in Note 19, Long-term Debt , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), under which we may be permitted to borrow up to an additional $5 million; and (2) 2021 operating budget, considered that approximately fifty-eight percent of our revenue is from recurring subscriptions, generally paid in advance, and that digital subscription revenue, that accounts for approximately thirty percent of subscription revenue, grew approximately thirty percent in 2020 demonstrating the strength of our premium brand, and the plan to continue to grow our subscription revenue from our acquisition of TheStreet in 2019 (as described in Note 3, Acquisitions , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements) and to grow premium digital subscriptions from our Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands (as described in Note 3, Acquisitions , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), which were launched in February 2021.

We have considered both quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the assessment that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were issued or were available to be issued, and concluded that conditions and events considered in the aggregate, do not raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss attributable to common shareholders was approximately $104.9 million. The total net loss attributable to common stockholders increased by approximately $66.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2019 net loss of approximately $38.5 million. The primary reasons for the increase in the total net loss is that our operations continued to rapidly expand during the year ended December 31, 2020 as they did in 2019. In particular, during the year ended December 31, 2020 we operated our Sports Illustrated media business that we acquired during the fourth quarter of 2019. The basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.28 increased from $1.04 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily because of: (i) the weighted average basic and diluted shares increased as the net loss per common share increased along with the calculation of the daily weighted average shares outstanding increase to 45,981,029 shares from 37,080,784 shares; (ii) the deemed dividend on the convertible preferred stock of approximately $15.6 million; and (iii) the other expenses of approximately $18.1 million.

Our growth strategy is principally focused on adding new publisher partners to our Maven Platform. In addition, if the right opportunity exists, we may also acquire related online media, publishing, and technology businesses. This combined growth strategy has expanded the scale of unique users interacting on our Maven Platform with increased revenues during 2020. We expect revenues increases in subsequent years will come from organic growth in operations, addition of more publisher partners, and mergers and acquisitions.

Change in Valuation of Warrant Derivative Liabilities . The change in valuation of warrant derivative liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the decrease in the fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2019 where the change was from an increase in the fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

Change in Valuation of Embedded Derivative Liabilities. The change in valuation of embedded derivative liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2020, as compared to the change in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2019 where the change was from an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense of approximately $16.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisting of approximately $6.6 million from amortization of debt discount on notes payable; approximately $9.2 million of accrued interest; and approximately $0.6 million of other interest. In fiscal 2019, interest expense primarily consisted of approximately $4.5 million of amortization of accretion of original issue discount and debt discount on notes payable; $3.1 million of accrued interest; and $2.9 million of other interest.

Liquidated Damages. We recorded approximately $1.5 million of liquidating damages, including the accrued interest thereon, during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily from the issuance of our 12% convertible debentures, Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock in fiscal 2020 since we determined that: (1) the registration statements registering for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 12% convertible debentures, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock would not be declared effective within the requisite time frame; and (2) that we would not be able to become current in our periodic filing obligations with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under the applicable securities purchase agreements. We recorded liquidated damages, including the accrued interest thereon, of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2019 primarily from issuance of our 12% convertible debentures, Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock, which liquidated damages were based upon the reasons set forth above.

## Deemed Dividend on Convertible Preferred Stock

Series H Preferred Stock . During fiscal 2020, in connection with the issuance of 108 shares (issued on August 19, 2020) and 389 shares (issued on October 31, 2020) of our Series H Preferred Stock, we recorded a beneficial conversion feature of approximately $0.1 million and approximately $0.4 million, respectively (totaling approximately $0.7 million), for the underlying shares of our common stock since the nondetachable conversion feature was in-the-money (the conversion price of $0.33 was lower than our common stock trading price of $0.86 and $0.77 at the issuance dates of August 19, 2020 and October 31, 2020, respectively). The beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a deemed dividend.

## Effects of Inflation

To date inflation has not had a material impact on our business or operating results.

## Our Future Business

In 2021, we completed the following acquisition:

## Acquisition of The Spun

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, platform development, impairment of long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

## Revenue

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of its revenue from contracts with customers. We account for revenue on a gross basis, as compared to a net basis, in its statement of operations. We made this determination based on it taking the credit risk in its revenue-generating transactions and it also being the primary obligor responsible for providing the services to the customer. Cost of revenues is presented as a separate line item in the statement of operations.

The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue:

## Advertising Revenue

Digital Advertising. We recognize revenue from digital advertisements at the point when each ad is viewed. The quantity of advertisements, the impression bid prices, and revenue are reported on a real-time basis. We enter into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with its various channels. Although reported advertising transactions are subject to adjustment by the advertising network partners, any such adjustments are known within a few days of month end. We owe our independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the advertising revenue earned, which is recorded as service costs in the same period in which the associated advertising revenue is recognized.

Advertising revenue that is comprised of fees charged for the placement of advertising on the websites that we own and operate, is recognized as the advertising or sponsorship is displayed, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Print Advertising. Advertising related revenues for print advertisements are recognized when advertisements are published (defined as an issue's on-sale date), net of provisions for estimated rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts.

## Subscription Revenue

Digital Subscriptions. We enter into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on our owned and operated media channels and facilitate such contracts between internet users and our Publisher Partners. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription to access the premium content. For subscription revenue generated by our independent Publisher Partners' content, we owe our Publisher Partners a revenue share of the membership subscription revenue earned, which is initially deferred and recorded as deferred contract costs. We recognize deferred contract costs over the membership subscription term in the same pattern that the associated membership subscription revenue is recognized.

40

Digital subscription revenue generated from our websites that we own and operate are charged to customers' credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers, and are generally billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. We calculate net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges. Net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods. Unearned revenue relates to payments for subscription fees for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided.

## Circulation Revenue

Circulation revenues include magazine subscriptions and single copy sales at newsstands.

Print Subscriptions. Revenue from magazine subscriptions are deferred and recognized proportionately as products are distributed to subscribers.

Newsstand. Single copy revenue is recognized on the publication's on-sale date, net of provisions for estimated returns. We base our estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

## Licensing Revenue

Content licensing-based revenues are accrued generally monthly or quarterly based on the specific mechanisms of each contract. Generally, revenues are accrued based on estimated sales and adjusted as actual sales are reported by partners. These adjustments are typically recorded within three months of the initial estimates and have not been material. Any minimum guarantees are typically earned evenly over the fiscal year.

## Contract Modifications

We occasionally enter into amendments to previously executed contracts that constitute contract modifications. We assess each of these contract modifications to determine:

- โ if the additional services and goods are distinct from the services and goods in the original arrangement; and
- โ if the amount of consideration expected for the added services or goods reflects the stand-alone selling price of those services and goods.

A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, or a cumulative catch-up basis.

## Cost of Revenue

Our cost of revenue represents the cost of providing our digital media network channels and advertising and membership services. The cost of revenue that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include:

- โ Publisher Partner guarantees and revenue share payments;
- โ amortization of developed technology and platform development;
- โ royalty fees;
- โ hosting, bandwidth and software license fees;
- โ printing, distribution, and fulfillment costs;
- โ payroll and related expenses for customer support, technology maintenance, and occupancy costs of related personnel;
- โ fees paid for data analytics and to other outside service providers; and
- โ stock-based compensation of related personnel.

41

## Platform Development

For the years presented, substantially all of our technology expenses are development costs for the Maven Platform that were capitalized as intangible costs. Technology costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other . This ASC requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized.

We capitalize internal labor costs, including compensation, benefits and payroll taxes, incurred for certain capitalized platform development projects. Our policy with respect to capitalized internal labor stipulates that labor costs for employees working on eligible internal use capital projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of the project when the impact, as compared to expensing such labor costs, is material. Maven Platform development capitalized during the application development stage of a project include:

- โ payroll and related expenses for personnel; and
- โ stock-based compensation of related personnel.

## Selling and Marketing

Selling and marketing consist primarily of expenses incurred in selling and marketing our products. Our selling and marketing expenses include:

- โ payroll and employee benefits of selling and marketing account management support teams;
- โ professional marketing services;
- โ office and occupancy costs;
- โ circulation costs;
- โ advertising costs; and
- โ stock-based compensation of related personnel.

## General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

- โ payroll and employee benefits for executive and administrative personnel;
- โ professional services, including accounting, legal and insurance;
- โ office and occupancy costs;
- โ conferences;
- โ other general corporate expenses; and
- โ stock-based compensation of related personnel.

## Leases

the consolidated balance sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. At inception, we determine whether an arrangement that provides control over the use of an asset is a lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the renewal period, we include the impact of the renewal in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

42

In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $1.7 million, lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $1.8 million, with no cumulative effect adjustment on retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to our consolidated statements of (as further described in Note 7, Leases, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually on December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We adopted ASU 2017-04 (as further described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements) during the first quarter of 2020 which eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. We operate as one reporting unit, therefore, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the Company to its carrying value. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis of determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.

## Stock-Based Compensation

We provide stock-based compensation in the form of (a) stock awards to employees and directors, comprised of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, (b) stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, (c) common stock warrants to Publisher Partners (as further described in Note 22, Stock-Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), and (d) common stock warrants to ABG (as further described in Note 22, Stock-Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

We account for stock awards and stock option grants to employees, directors, and consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the stock-based payments as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are time-vested are measured at fair value on the grant date, and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are performance-vested are measured at fair value on the grant date and charged to operations when the performance condition is satisfied.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07 (as further described in Note 22, Stock-Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), we accounted for stock-based payments to certain directors and consultants, and Publisher Partners (collectively the "non-employee awards") by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon the measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the later of the adoption date of ASU 201807, or the date of grant, without change in the fair value of the award. There was no cumulative effect of adoption of ASU 2018-07 on January 1, 2019. For stock-based awards granted to non-employees subject to graded vesting that only contain service conditions, we have elected to recognize stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line recognition method.

43

The fair value measurement of equity awards and grants used for stock-based compensation is as follows: (1) restricted stock awards and restricted stock units which are time-vested are determined using the quoted market price of the Company's common stock at the grant date; (2) stock option grants which are time-vested and performance-vested are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date; (3) restricted stock awards which provide for performancevesting and a true-up provision are determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm using the binomial pricing model at the grant date; (4) stock option grants which provide for market-based vesting with a time-vesting overlay are determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date; (5) Publisher Partner Warrants are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model; and (6) ABG Warrants are determined utilizing the Monte Carlo model (as further described in Note 22, Stock-Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

Fair value determined under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo model is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option or warrants, as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and is evaluated based upon market comparisons. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of our common stock.

The fair value of the stock options granted were probability weighted effective January 1, 2019 under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or Monte Carlo model as determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm since the value of the units or options, among other things, depend on the volatility of the underlying shares of our common stock, under the following two scenarios: (1) scenario one assumes that our common stock will be up-listed on a national stock exchange (the "Exchange") on a certain listing date (the "Up-list Date"); and (2) scenario two assumes that our common stock is not up-listed on the Exchange prior to the final vesting date of the grants (the "No Up-list"), collectively referred to as the "Probability Weighted Scenarios".

We classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's cash compensation costs are classified.

## Income Taxes

We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-

lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily by reference to the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2020, the following transactions, obligations or relationships represent our off-balance sheet arrangements:

Strome Warrants. On June 15, 2018, we modified the two securities purchase agreements dated January 4, 2018 and March 30, 2018 with Strome Mezzanine Fund LP ("Strome"). Strome was also granted observer rights on our Board. As consideration for such modification, we issued warrants to Strome to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, exercisable at price of $0.50 per share (as amended) (as further described in Note 21, Stockholders' Equity , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), which are carried on our consolidated balance sheets as a derivative liability at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end since, among other criteria, delivery of unregistered shares is precluded upon exercise The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and may, in the event there is no effective registration statement covering the resale of the warrant shares, be exercised on a cashless basis in certain circumstances. Warrants exercisable for up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, with a derivative liability fair value of $704,707. In the event Strome decided to exercise these warrants, since shares of our common stock were available to settle the instrument, there would be no impact to our cash resources.

B. Riley Warrants. On October 18, 2018, we issued warrants to B. Riley to purchase up to 875,000 shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $1.00 per share (as further described in Note 21, Stockholders' Equity , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets as a derivative liability at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end since, among other criteria, delivery of unregistered shares is precluded upon exercise. The warrants are exercisable for a period of seven years, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and may, if at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issuance of the warrants there is no effective registration statement covering the re-sale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, be exercised on a cashless basis. Warrants exercisable for up to 875,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, with a derivative liability fair value of $443,188. In the event B. Riley decided to exercise these warrants (which are subject to certain contractual exercise limitations), since shares of our common stock were available to settle the instrument after considering the contractual exercise limitations, there would be no impact to our cash resources.

## Contractual Obligations

The following table sets forth our principal cash operating obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020, aggregating to approximately $49.5 million.

## Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. This evaluation commenced in 2020 and continued until the filing of this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore, smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

46

Based on our evaluation under the framework in COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. This conclusion is based on such criteria and we believe that control over financial reporting was ineffective because: (i) we lacked monitoring over the completeness and accuracy of our underlying accounting records and had ineffective controls over our period end financial disclosure and reporting processes and information technology systems; (ii) we had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (iii) we have a history of untimely filed periodic reports, including being unable to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (that was filed in January 2021), our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included our quarterly results for 2019 (that was filed in April 2021), and our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020 (that were filed in May 2021). These weaknesses continue and have not been remediated as of the date of filing this Annual Report.

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated and begun to implement procedures intended to remediate the material weaknesses identified as of December 31, 2020. During fiscal 2020, we have engaged external certified public accountants to assist our accounting department and Chief Financial Officer in preparing the necessary periodic reports. In TheStreet Merger, we also acquired some additional employees with accounting experience that has assisted us with preparing our periodic reports. We believe our accounting department is now capable of bringing us current with our periodic filing obligations. In addition, our Audit Committee is now assisting our Board in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee (i) the integrity of our financial statements, our accounting and financial reporting processes, and financial statement audits, (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) our systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, (iv) the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm, and its qualifications, performance, compensation, and independence, (v) review and approval of related party transactions, and (vi) the communication among our independent registered public accounting firm, our financial and senior management, and our Board.

In addition, we intend to undertake the following additional remediation measures to address the material weaknesses described in this Annual Report:

- (i) we intend to update the documentation of our internal control processes, including formal risk assessment of our financial reporting processes; and
- (ii) we intend to implement procedures pursuant to which we can ensure segregation of duties and hire additional resources to ensure appropriate review and oversight.

We have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in us being unable to fully implement our remediation plan. We will continue to evaluate and implement procedures as deemed appropriate to remediate these material weaknesses; however, we expect that the remediation of those matters that were deemed material weaknesses will be fully complete no later than December 31, 2021.

## Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financing Reporting

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes, we continue to review, test, and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. Other than with respect to the remediation efforts discussed above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Heckman Monthly Fee payments may be partially accelerated in the event of certain financings. In addition, Mr. Heckman's eligibility to be retained by Maven Coalition, and provide services pursuant to the Heckman Amendment, is conditioned upon Mr. Heckman's execution of, and not subsequently revoking, a General Release and Continuing Obligations Agreement ("GRCOA") between Mr. Heckman, Maven Coalition, Maven Media, TheStreet, Heckman Media, LLC, and us. The GRCOA addresses certain agreements between the parties related to certain stock options previously granted by us to Mr. Heckman and voting agreements related to the shares issuable upon exercise of those options, among other items. Pursuant to the terms of the GRCOA, we amended that certain 2016 Stock Incentive Plan Option Agreement dated September 14, 2018 (the "Original 2016 Option") and that certain 2019 Equity Incentive Plan Option Agreement dated April 10, 2019 (the "Original 2019 Option"). The amendment to the Original 2016 Option (the "2016 Amendment") clarifies that the option qualifies as a non-statutory stock option and that it remains exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option. The amendment to the Original 2019 Option (the "2019 Amendment") also clarifies that the option qualifies as a non-statutory stock option and that it remains exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option. The 2019 Amendment also changed the vesting schedule of the option to provide for immediate vesting of a portion of the option, with the remainder of the option being subject to performance-based vesting that is tied to the price of our common stock.

## Director Compensation Policies

On January 1, 2020, our Board approved and adopted the 2020 Outside Director Compensation Policy (the "January 2020 Compensation Policy"). The January 2020 Compensation Policy applied to non-employee directors (the "Outside Directors"), providing that the Outside Directors would be granted annually a restricted stock award of a number of shares of our common stock equal in value to $50,000. It also provided that any Outside Director who serves as the chairperson of one or more committees of our Board will be granted annually a restricted stock award of a number of shares of our common stock equal in value to $50,000. However, each Outside Director may only receive one award for their service as a chairperson, regardless of the number of committees chaired. The shares of our common stock underlying each award vests in 12 equal monthly installments.

62

The 2020 Compensation Policy included annual cash compensation to each Outside Director of $25,000 and to the Chairman of our Board of $30,000, payable quarterly. However, on May 27, 2020, our Board approved and adopted a new 2020 Outside Director Compensation Policy (the "May 2020 Compensation Policy" and, together with the January 2020 Compensation Policy, the "2020 Compensation Policies"). The May 2020 Compensation Policy includes the same provisions of the January 2020 Compensation Policy, except that it removed the cash compensation to Outside Directors.

## Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-of-Control

## Mr. Levinsohn

The Second A&R Employment Agreement provides for various termination events under which Mr. Levinsohn would be entitled to annual bonuses earned but not yet paid and salary continuation through December 31, 2023, or the end of any renewal term, if applicable, but in no event will he be eligible to less than twelve months of salary continuation and reimbursement of 18 consecutive months of COBRA costs. In addition, he would be entitled to the acceleration of vesting of outstanding equity awards.

## Mr. Heckman

The Heckman Employment Agreement provided for various termination events under which he would have been entitled to one year's severance equal to his annual salary amount. Subsequent to fiscal 2019, Mr. Heckman and we entered into a Separation Agreement, dated August 26, 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to hire Mr. Heckman as a consultant for a one-year period and pay him a monthly consulting fee of approximately $29,200 per month. The terms of the consulting arrangement were set forth in a separate consulting agreement. The consulting agreement was amended on June 3, 2021 to provide that Mr. Heckman would be paid approximately $57,895 per month through August 2022.

## Mr. Kraft

The 2020 Kraft Employment Agreement provides for various termination events under which Mr. Kraft would be entitled to 50% of his annualized salary, his annual bonus based on 100% of goal attainment, payment for bonuses already earned, and immediate acceleration of the vesting of any unvested time or stock price target options. Effective January 1, 2021, the A&R Kraft Agreement provides for various termination events under which Mr. Kraft would be entitled to one year's severance equal to his annual salary and bonus amounts based on achievement of 100% of his personal goals, which would be paid as salary continuation, and receive payment for earned businesses. Mr. Kraft would also be entitled to COBRA premiums and all outstanding unvested equity awards would become fully vested.

## Mr. Zimak

The Zimak Employment Agreement provides for various termination events under which he would be entitled to salary continuance for the longer of (i) the remainder of the term of the Zimak Employment Agreement or (ii) one year following the date of the termination, and all of the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units awarded to Mr. Zimak pursuant to the Zimak Employment Agreement. Effective January 1, 2021, the A&R Zimak Employment Agreement provides for various termination events under which Mr. Zimak would be entitled to salary continuation for up to one year.

## Plans Adopted Without Approval of Security Holders

## Publisher Partner Warrant Program

We operate and continue to develop an exclusive network of professionally managed online media channels, with an underlying technology platform. Each channel is operated by an invitation-only Publisher Partner. On December 19, 2016, as amended on August 23, 2017, and August 23, 2018, our Board approved the Channel Partner Warrant Program (the "Publisher Partner Warrant Program") to be administered by management that authorized us to grant to certain of the Publisher Partners, Publisher Partner Warrants (the "Publisher Partner Warrants") to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Publisher Partner Warrant Program. The Publisher Partner Warrant Program was intended to provide equity incentive to the Publisher Partners to motivate and reward them for their services to us and to align the interests of the Publisher Partners with those of our stockholders. The Publisher Partner Warrants had certain performance conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the Publisher Partner Warrants, we would notify the respective Publisher Partner of the number of shares earned, with one-third of the earned shares vesting on the notice date, one-third of the earned shares vesting on the first anniversary of the notice date, and the remaining one-third of the earned shares vesting on the second anniversary of the notice date. The Publisher Partner Warrants had a term of five years from issuance and could also be exercised on a cashless basis. Performance conditions are generally based on the average of number of unique visitors on the channel operation by the Publisher Partner generated during the six-month period from the launch of the Publisher Partner's operations on our platform or the revenue generated during the period from the issuance date through a specified end date.

During fiscal 2018, we issued Publisher Partner Warrants to 14 Publisher Partners that were exercisable for up to 295,000 shares of our common stock, in the aggregate. The Publisher Partner Warrants vest over three years, have a per share exercise price ranging from $1.32 to $2.25, with a weighted average price of $1.74, and expire five years from the issuance date. In addition to the three-year vesting condition, the Publisher Partner Warrants have performance conditions that determine how many shares of our common stock underlying the Publisher Partner Warrants are earned. As of December 31, 2019, Publisher Partner Warrants exercisable for up to 1,017,140 shares were earned and remained outstanding (after taking into consideration forfeitures), and 613,041 were vested and exercisable.

In the aggregate, as of December 31, 2020, Publisher Partner Warrants exercisable for up to 789,541 shares of our common stock were earned and remained outstanding, of which 463,041 were vested and exercisable. As of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were issued or were available to be issued, 1,210,459 of shares of our common stock remain available for issuance pursuant to the Publisher Partner Warrant Program.

On March 10, 2019, our Board terminated the initial Publisher Partner Warrant Program, and approved the "second" Publisher Partner Warrant Program, that authorized us to grant Publisher Partner Warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. Such Publisher Partner Warrants were to be issued with the same terms as the first Publisher Partner Warrant Program, except that the shares of our common stock underlying these Publisher Partner Warrants are earned and vest over three years and have a five-term.

On May 20, 2020, our Board terminated the second Publisher Partner Warrant Program, and approved the "third" Publisher Partner Warrant Program, that authorized us to grant Publisher Partner Warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. Such Publisher Partner Warrants granted under the third Publisher Partner Warrant Program were to be issued with the same terms as the second Publisher Partner Warrant Program, except that any Publisher Partner Warrants issued under the third Publisher Partner Warrant Program are no longer subject to performance conditions.

## Outside Options

During fiscal 2018, our Board approved the granting of options outside of the 2016 Plan (the "Outside Options") to certain officers, directors and employees to provide equity incentive in exchange for consideration in the form of services to us. The Outside Options are exercisable for shares of our common stock. During 2018 and 2019, our Board granted Outside Options exercisable for up to 2,414,000 and 1,500,000, respectively, shares of our common stock. The Outside Options either vest upon the passage of time or are tied to the achievement of certain performance targets. On January 8, 2021, our Board approved an amendment to the Outside Option award grants, which eliminated the certain performance targets, therefore, the awards continue to vest solely on the time vesting condition.

## Warrants

On June 14, 2019, our Board approved the grant of the warrants to acquire up to 21,989,844 shares our common stock to ABG in connection with the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands. Half the warrants have an exercise price of $0.42 per share (the "Forty-Two Cents Warrants"). The other half of the warrants have an exercise price of $0.84 per share (the "Eighty-Four Cents Warrants"). The warrants provide for the following: (1) 40% of the Forty-Two Cents Warrants and 40% of the Eighty-Four Cents Warrants will vest in equal monthly increments over a period of two years beginning on the one-year anniversary of the date of issuance of the warrants (any unvested portion of such warrants to be forfeited by ABG upon certain terminations by us of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement); (2) 60% of the Forty-Two Cents Warrants and 60% of the Eighty-Four Cents Warrants will vest based on the achievement of certain performance goals for the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands in calendar years 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023; (3) under certain circumstances we may require ABG to exercise all (and not less than all) of the warrants, in which case all of the warrants will be vested; (4) all of the warrants will automatically vest upon certain terminations of the Licensing Agreement by ABG or upon a change of control of us; and (5) ABG will have the right to participate, on a pro-rata basis (including vested and unvested warrants, exercised or unexercised), in any of our future equity issuances (subject to customary exceptions). Pursuant to the SI Fourth Amendment, the exercise price of fifty percent (50%) of the Eighty-Four Cents Warrants was changed to $0.42 per share in exchange for additional benefits under the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement.

Nothing was outstanding as of December 31, 2020.

## Director Independence

As of December 31, 2020, our Board was composed of seven persons - Ross Levinsohn, John Fichthorn, Peter Mills, Todd Sims, B. Rinku Sen, David Bailey, and Joshua Jacobs. We do not have securities listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has director independence or committee independence requirements. Accordingly, we are not required to comply with any director independence requirements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing lack of applicable independence requirements, as of December 31, 2020, our Board had four members that qualified as "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act and Rule 5605 of The Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules.

Based upon all facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, our Board has determined that Mr.Peter B. Mills, Mr. John Fichthorn, Mr. Todd Sims, and Ms. B. Rinku Sen are all independent, and do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

Our Board has determined that Mr. Ross Levinsohn, by virtue of his position as our Chief Executive Officer, as well as Mr. Joshua Jacobs, by virtue of his position as our President from January 1, 2018 through October 1, 2019, were not independent during fiscal 2020. Our Board also determined that Mr. David Bailey, by virtue of his affiliation with BTC Inc. and his affiliation with other related parties, was not independent during fiscal 2020.

Since the end of 2020, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Jacobs resigned as directors. Carlo Zola and Dan Shribman joined our Board as directors in June 2021. Based on Rule 5606 of The Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, we believe that both directors are independent.

In making the determinations discussed above, our Board considered information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment, affiliations, family relationships. Our Board also considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director had with our Company, including the relationship of certain of our directors with certain of our significant stockholders, B. Riley and Warlock.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

TheMaven, Inc. and Subsidiaries

## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TheMaven, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended

Ross Levinsohn Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer)

## TheMaven, Inc.

December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

## Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of the Contract Modification to Certain Subscription Contacts

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company modified certain digital and magazine subscription contracts. The Company determined that the contract modification was a termination of the existing contract and a creation of a new contract with each individual subscriber. The Company accounted for the contract modification on a prospective basis.

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to these contract modifications is a critical audit matter, are there is significant audit judgment by management in determining the impact related to revenue recognition, contract assets and contract liabilities and classification of short-term and longterm presentation to the Company's future period balance sheets.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The procedures included, amongst others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company's estimation process related to contract modification (ii) testing the number of future unserved subscription copies at the contract modification date to estimate the financial impact of the contract modification to both the current period and future period earnings (iii) testing management's analysis of the financial impact of the contract modification to contract asset and contract liabilities balances as of end of the year and the impact to current period earnings (iv) testing the mathematical accuracy of the analysis prepared by management (v) evaluating the appropriateness of the presentation to the consolidated financial statements.

## 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

## Organization

TheMaven, Inc. (the "Maven" or "Company"), was incorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990. On October 11, 2016, the predecessor entity now known as Maven exchanged its shares with another entity that was incorporated in Delaware on July 22, 2016. On November 4, 2016, these entities consummated a recapitalization. This resulted in Maven becoming the parent entity, and the other Delaware entity becoming the wholly owned subsidiary. On December 19, 2019, the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries Maven Coalition, Inc., and HubPages, Inc., a Delaware corporation that was acquired by the Company in a merger during 2018 ("HubPages"), were merged into another of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, Say Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation that was acquired by the Company in a merger during 2018 ("Say Media"), with Say Media as the surviving corporation. On January 6, 2020, Say Media changed its name to Maven Coalition, Inc. ("Coalition"). As of December 31, 2020, the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries consist of Coalition, Maven Media Brands, LLC ("Maven Media" formed during 2019 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Maven) and TheStreet, Inc. ("TheStreet" acquired by the Company in a merger during 2019 as further described in Note 3).

Unless the context indicates otherwise, Maven, Coalition, and TheStreet, are together hereinafter referred to as the "Company."

## Business Operations

The Company operates a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. The Company operates a significant portion of the media businesses for Sports Illustrated (as defined below), own and operate TheStreet, Inc. (the "TheStreet"), and power more than 250 independent brands. The Maven technology platform (the "Maven Platform") provides digital publishing, distribution, and monetization capabilities for the Sports Illustrated and TheStreet businesses as well as a coalition of independent, professionally managed, online media publishers (each a "Publisher Partner"). Each Publisher Partner joins the media-coalition by invitation-only and is drawn from premium media brands and independent publishing businesses. Publisher Partners publish content and oversee an online community for their respective sites, leveraging our proprietary technology platform to engage the collective audiences within a single network. Generally, Publisher Partners are independently owned, strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. When they join, the Company believes Publisher Partners will benefit from the proprietary technology of the Maven Platform, techniques and relationships. Advertising revenue may improve due to the scale we have achieved by combining all Publisher Partners onto a single platform and a large and experienced sales organization. They may also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems, which we believe will enhance their revenue. Additionally, the Company believes the lead brand within each vertical creates a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners in the vertical while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content. While they benefit from these critical performance improvements they also may save substantially in costs of technology, infrastructure, advertising sales, and member marketing and management.

F-7

The Company's growth strategy is to continue to expand the coalition by adding new Publisher Partners in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on the Company's technology platform. In each vertical, the Company seeks to build around a leading brand, such as Sports Illustrated (for sports) and TheStreet (for finance), surround it with subcategory publisher specialists, and further enhance coverage with individual expert contributors. The primary means of expansion is adding independent Publisher Partners and/or acquiring publishers that have premium branded content and can broaden the reach and impact of the Company's technology platform.

In June 2019, the Company entered into a licensing agreement (the "Initial Licensing Agreement") with ABG-SI LLC ("ABG"), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Licensing Agreement, dated September 1, 2019 (the "First Amendment"), Amendment No. 2 to Licensing Agreement, dated April 1, 2020 (the "Second Amendment"), and Amendment No. 3 to Licensing Agreement, dated July 28, 2020 (the "Third Agreement" and, together with the Initial Licensing Agreement, First Amendment, and Second Amendment, the "Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement") to license certain Sports Illustrated ("Sports Illustrated") brands as part of its growth strategy. In August 2019, the Company acquired TheStreet. For addition information, see Note 3.

The Company's common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.'s Pink Open Market under the symbol "MVEN".

## Seasonality

The Company experiences typical media company advertising and membership sales seasonality, which is strong in the fiscal fourth quarter and slower in the fiscal first quarter.

## Going Concern

The Company performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess its ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company has a history of recurring losses. The Company's recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of the impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related shut down of most professional and collegiate sports, which reduced user traffic and advertising revenue. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a marketing investment in customer growth, together with investment in people and technology as we continued to expand our operations, and operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2019 with the TheStreet Merger and the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement.

As reflected in these consolidated financial statements, the Company had revenues of $128,032,397 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative working capital, and negative operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $104,874,558, utilized cash in operating activities of $32,294,587, and as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $162,273,286. The Company has financed its working capital requirements since inception through the issuance of debt and equity securities.

F-8

The negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021 has been to a lesser extent than in 2020. Beginning in 2021, restrictions on non-essential work activity have begun to lift and sporting and other events have begun to be held, with attendance closer to pre-pandemic levels, which has resulted in an increase in traffic to the Maven Platform and, thereby an increase in advertising revenue. The ultimate extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions will be put in place again, and the extent and effectiveness of containment and other actions taken, including the percentage of the population that receives COVID-19 vaccinations, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Management has evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management's assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date these consolidated financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.

Management's assessment of the Company's ability to meet its future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. The factors that the Company considered important in its going concern analysis, include, but are not limited to, the Company's fiscal 2021 cash flow forecast and its fiscal 2021 operating budget. Management also considered the Company's implementation of additional measures, if required, related to potential revenue and earnings declines from COVID-19. These factors consider information including, but not limited to, the Company's financial condition, liquidity sources, obligations due within one year after the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, the funds necessary to maintain operations and financial conditions, including negative financial trends or other indicators of possible financial difficulty.

In particular, the Company's plan for the: (1) 2021 cash flow forecast, considered the use of its working capital line with FastPay (as described in Note 14) to fund changes in working capital, under which the Company has available credit of approximately $8.5 million as of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, and that the Company does not anticipate the need for any further borrowings that are subject to the approval of the holders of the Term Note (as described in Note 19) under which the Company may be permitted to borrow up to an additional $5.0 million; and (2) 2021 operating budget, considered that approximately fifty-eight percent of the Company's revenue is from recurring subscriptions, generally paid in advance, and that digital subscription revenue, that accounts for approximately thirty percent of subscription revenue, grew approximately thirty percent in 2020 demonstrating the strength of its premium brand, and the plan to continue to grow its subscription revenue from its acquisition of TheStreet in 2019 (as described in Note 3) and to grow premium digital subscriptions from its Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands (as described in Note 3), in which were launched in February 2021.

The Company has considered both quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the assessment that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date these consolidated financial statements were issued or were available to be issued and concluded that conditions and events considered in the aggregate, do not raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date.

## Reclassifications

Certain comparative amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. These reclassifications were immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate. These changes did not impact previously reported loss from operations or net loss.

## F-9

## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the financial statements of Maven and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Coalition, and TheStreet. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

## Foreign Currency

The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local currencies (U.K. pounds sterling and Canadian dollar), as it is the monetary unit of account of the principal economic environment in which the Company's foreign subsidiaries operate. All assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the period, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gain or loss resulting from the process of translating foreign currencies financial statements into U.S. dollars was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, therefore, a foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment was not reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss was omitted from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, if any, resulting from or expected to result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recognized in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include those related to the selection of useful lives of property and equipment, intangible assets, capitalization of platform development and associated useful lives; assumptions used in accruals for potential liabilities; fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business acquisitions, the fair value of the Company's goodwill and the assessment of acquired goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment; determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation and valuation of derivatives liabilities; and the assumptions used to calculate contingent liabilities, and realization of deferred tax assets. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

## Risks and Uncertainties

The Company has a limited operating history and has not generated significant revenues to date to cover its operating expenses. The Company's business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets and the general condition of the U.S. and world economy. A host of factors beyond the Company's control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse developments in these general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the results of its operations.

In addition, the Company will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded projects, marketing and sales operations as well as extensive human capital. The Company may be unable to compete successfully against these companies. The Company's industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and market demands. As a result, the Company's products, services, and/or expertise may become obsolete and/or unmarketable. The Company's future success will depend on its ability to adapt to technological advances, anticipate customer and market demands, and enhance its current technology under development.

## F-10

With the initial onset of COVID-19, the Company faced significant change in its advertisers' buying behavior. The Company's advertising revenue from Sports Illustrated was impacted as a result of sports authorities around the world making the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance sports events in an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Since May 2020, there has been a steady recovery in the advertising market in both pricing and volume, which coupled with the return of professional and college sports yielded steady growth in revenues through the balance of 2020 and the first half of 2021. The Company expects a continued modest growth in advertising revenue back toward pre-pandemic levels. As a result of the Company's advertising revenue declining in early 2020, the Company is vulnerable to a risk of loss in the near term and it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances may occur that could cause a significant impact in the near term, that

depend on future developments, including the duration of COVID-19, future sport event advisories and restrictions, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken.

Since August 2018, B. Riley FBR, Inc. ("B. Riley FBR"), a registered broker-dealer owned by B. Riley Financial, Inc., a diversified publicly-traded financial services company ("B. Riley"), has been instrumental in providing investment banking services to the Company and in raising debt and equity capital for the Company. These services have included raising debt and equity capital to support various acquisitions, including TheStreet, the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement with ABG (as described in Note 3) and the acquisition of the College Spun Media Incorporated (as described in Note 27). The raising debt and equity capital for the acquisitions, refinancing and working capital purposes included the sale of the 12% Convertible Debentures (as described in Note 18), 12% Second Amended Senior Secured Notes (as described in Note 19), Preferred Stock (as described in Note 20), and subsequent equity offerings of common stock (as described in Note 27).

## Revenue Recognition

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company accounts for revenue on a gross basis, as compared to a net basis, in its statement of operations. Cost of revenues is presented as a separate line item in the statement of operations. The Company has made this determination based on it taking the credit risk in its revenue-generating transactions and it also being the primary obligor responsible for providing the services to the customer.

The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates revenue:

## Advertising Revenue

Digital Advertising The Company recognizes revenue from digital advertisements at the point when each ad is viewed. The quantity of advertisements, the impression bid prices and revenue are reported on a real-time basis. The Company enters into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with its various channels. Although reported advertising transactions are subject to adjustment by the advertising network partners, any such adjustments are known within a few days of month end. The Company owes its independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the advertising revenue earned, which is recorded as service costs in the same period in which the associated advertising revenue is recognized.

Advertising revenue that is comprised of fees charged for the placement of advertising, on the Company's flagship website, TheStreet.com, is recognized as the advertising or sponsorship is displayed, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Print Advertising Advertising related revenues for print advertisements are recognized when advertisements are published (defined as an issue's on-sale date), net of provisions for estimated rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts.

## F-11

## Subscription Revenue

Digital Subscriptions - The Company enters into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on the owned and operated media channels and facilitate such contracts between internet users and our Publisher Partners. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription to access the premium content. The Company owes its independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the membership subscription revenue earned, which is initially deferred and recorded as deferred contract costs. The Company recognizes deferred contract costs over the membership subscription term in the same pattern that the associated membership subscription revenue is recognized.

Subscription revenue generated from the Company's flagship website TheStreet.com from institutional and retail customers is comprised of subscriptions and license fees for access to securities investment information, stock market commentary, director and officer profiles, relationship capital management services, and transactional information pertaining to mergers and acquisitions and other changes in the corporate control environment. Subscriptions are charged to customers' credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers, and are generally billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The Company calculates net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges. Net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods. Unearned revenue relates to payments for subscription fees for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided.

## Circulation Revenue

Circulation revenues include magazine subscriptions and single copy sales at newsstands.

Print Subscriptions Revenues from magazine subscriptions are deferred and recognized proportionately as products are distributed to subscribers.

Newsstand - Single copy revenue is recognized on the publication's on-sale date, net of provisions for estimated returns. The Company bases its estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

## Licensing Revenue

Content licensing-based revenues are accrued generally monthly or quarterly based on the specific mechanisms of each contract. Generally, revenues are accrued based on estimated sales and adjusted as actual sales are reported by partners. These adjustments are typically recorded within three months of the initial estimates and have not been material. Any minimum guarantees are typically earned evenly over the fiscal year.

## Nature of Performance Obligations

At contract inception, the Company assesses the obligations promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service or bundle that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all the promises in the contract, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer.

## F-12

Digital Advertising - The Company sells digital advertising inventory on its websites directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies. The Company's performance obligations related to digital advertising are generally satisfied when the advertisement is run on the Company's platform. The price for direct digital advertising is determined in contracts with the advertisers. Revenue from the sale of direct digital advertising is recognized when the advertisements are delivered based on the contract. The customer is invoiced the agreed-upon price in the month following the month that the advertisements are delivered with normal trade terms. The agreed upon price is adjusted for estimated provisions for rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts. As part of the Company's customary business practices, digital advertising contracts may include a guaranteed number of impressions and sales incentives to its customers including volume discounts, rebates, value added

impressions, etc. For all such contracts that include these types of variable consideration, the Company estimates the variable consideration and factors in such an estimate when determining the transaction price.

Print Advertising -The Company provides advertisement placements in print media directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies. The Company's performance obligations related to print advertising are satisfied when the magazine in which an advertisement appears is published, which is defined as an issue's on-sale date. The customer is invoiced the agreed-upon price when the advertisements are published under normal industry trade terms. The agreed upon price is adjusted for estimated provisions for rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts. As part of the Company's customary business practices, print advertising contracts include guaranteed circulation levels of magazines, referred to as rate base, and a number of sales incentives to its customers including volume discounts, rebates, bonus pages, etc. For all such contracts that include these types of variable consideration, the Company estimates such when determining the transaction price.

Digital Subscriptions - The Company recognizes revenue from each membership subscription to access the premium content over time based on a daily calculation of revenue during the reporting period, which is generally one year. Subscriber payments are initially recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheets. As the Company provides access to the premium content over the membership subscription term, the Company recognizes revenue and proportionately reduces the unearned revenue balance.

Print Subscriptions - The Company sells magazines to consumers through subscriptions. Each copy of a magazine is determined to be a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied when the publication is sent to the customer. The majority of the Company's subscription sales are prepaid at the time of order. Subscriptions may be canceled at any time for a refund of the price paid for remaining issues. As the contract may be canceled at any time for a full refund of the unserved copies, the contract term is determined to be on an issue-to-issue basis as these contracts do not have substantive termination penalties. Revenues from subscriptions are deferred and recognized proportionately as subscribers are served. Some magazine subscription offers contain more than one magazine title in a bundle. The Company allocates the total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation, or magazine title, based on a standalone-selling price basis.

Newsstand - The Company sells single copy magazines, or bundles of single copy magazines, to wholesalers for ultimate resale on newsstands primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other electronic devices. Publications sold to magazine wholesalers are sold with the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to the wholesaler by retailers. Revenue is recognized on the issue's on-sale date as the date aligns most closely with the date that control is transferred to the customer. The Company bases its estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

Licensing The Company has entered into various licensing agreements that provide third-party partners the right to utilize the Company's content. Functional licenses in national media consist of content licensing.

## F-13

## Timing of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations

Point-in-Time Performance Obligations For performance obligations related to certain digital advertising space and sales of print advertisements, the Company determines that the customer can direct the use of and obtain substantially all the benefits from the advertising products as the digital impressions are served or on the issue's on-sale date. For performance obligations related to sales of magazines through subscriptions, the customer obtains control when each magazine issue is mailed to the customer on or before the issue's on-sale date. For sales of single copy magazines on newsstands, revenue is recognized on the issue's on-sale date as the date aligns most closely with the date that control is transferred to the customer. Revenues from functional licenses are recognized at a point-in-time when access to the completed content is granted to the partner.

Over-Time Performance Obligations -For performance obligations related to sales of certain digital advertising space, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue over time by measuring progress towards complete satisfaction using the most appropriate method.

For performance obligations related to digital advertising, the Company satisfies its performance obligations on some flat-fee digital advertising placements over time using a time-elapsed output method.

Determining a measure of progress requires management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. The Company has determined that the above method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services to the customer. For performance obligations recognized using a time-elapsed output method, the Company's efforts are expended evenly throughout the period.

Performance obligations related to subscriptions to premium content on the digital media channels provides access for a given period of time, which is generally one year. The Company recognizes revenue from each membership subscription over time based on a daily calculation of revenue during the reporting period.

## Transaction Price and Amounts Allocated to Performance Obligations

Determining the Transaction Price Certain advertising contracts contain variable components of the transaction price, such as volume discounts and rebates. The Company has sufficient historical data and has established processes to reliably estimate these variable components of the transaction price.

Subscription revenue generated from the flagship website TheStreet.com is subject to estimation and variability due to the fact that, in the normal course of business, subscribers may for various reasons contact the Company or their credit card companies to request a refund or other adjustment for a previously purchased subscription. With respect to many of the Company's annual newsletter subscription products, the Company offers the ability to receive a refund during the first 30 days but none thereafter. Accordingly, the Company maintains a provision for estimated future revenue reductions resulting from expected refunds and chargebacks related to subscriptions for which revenue was recognized in a prior period. The calculation of this provision is based upon historical trends and is reevaluated each quarter.

The Company typically does not offer any type of variable consideration in standard magazine subscription contracts. For these contracts, the transaction price is fixed upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale including description, quantity and price of each subscription purchased. Therefore, the Company does not estimate variable consideration or perform a constraint analysis for these contracts.

A right of return exists for newsstand contracts. The Company has sufficient historical data to estimate the final amount of returns and reduces the transaction price at contract inception for the expected return reserve.

There is no variable consideration related to functional licenses.

## F-14

Estimating Standalone-Selling Prices -For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone-selling price basis. The standalone-selling price is the price at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to the customer. In situations in which an obligation is bundled with other obligations and the total amount of consideration does not reflect the sum of individual observable prices, the Company allocates the discount to (1) a single obligation if the discount is attributable to that obligation or (2) prorates across all obligations if the discount relates to the bundle. When standalone-selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates and considers all the information that is reasonably available to the Company, including market conditions, entity specific factors, customer information, etc. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.

Measuring Obligations for Returns and Refunds - The Company accepts product returns in some cases. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors and the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a subscription refund liability of $4,035,531 and $3,144,172, respectively, was recorded for the provision for the estimated returns and refunds on the consolidated balance sheets.

## Contract Modifications

The Company occasionally enters into amendments to previously executed contracts that constitute contract modifications. The Company assesses each of these contract modifications to determine:

- โ if the additional services and goods are distinct from the services and goods in the original arrangement; and
- โ if the amount of consideration expected for the added services or goods reflects the stand-alone selling price of those services and goods.

A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, or a cumulative catch-up basis (further details are provided under the headings Contract Balances and Subscription Acquisition Costs ).

## Disaggregation of Revenue

The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by product line, geographical market and timing of revenue recognition:

## Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue represents the cost of providing the Company's digital media network channels and advertising and membership services. The cost of revenue that the Company has incurred in the periods presented primarily include: Publisher Partner guarantees and revenue share payments; amortization of developed technology and platform development; royalty fees; hosting and bandwidth and software license fees; printing and distribution costs; payroll and related expenses for customer support, technology maintenance, and occupancy costs of related personnel; fees paid for data analytics and to other outside service providers; and stock-based compensation of related personnel and stock-based compensation related to Publisher Partner Warrants (as described in Note 22).

## Contract Balances

The timing of the Company's performance under its various contracts often differs from the timing of the customer's payment, which results in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability. A contract asset is recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer and the Company does not have the contractual right to bill for the related performance obligations. An asset is recognized when certain costs incurred to obtain a contract meet the capitalization criteria. A contract liability is recognized when consideration is received from the customer prior to the transfer of goods or services.

| Magazine circulation                                | 22,712,961           | 30,478,154           |
| Other                                               | 192,500              | 222,500              |
|                                                     | $ 23,498,597         | $ 31,179,211         |

Unearned Revenue - Unearned revenue, also referred to as contract liabilities, include payments received in advance of performance under the contracts and are recognized as revenue over time. The Company records contract liabilities as unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Digital subscription and magazine circulation revenue of $32,163,087 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 from unearned revenue at the beginning of the year.

During January and February of 2020, the Company modified certain digital and magazine subscription contracts that prospectively changed the frequency of the related

issues required to be delivered on a yearly basis (the "Contract Modifications"). The Company determined that the remaining digital content and magazines to be delivered are distinct from the digital content or magazines already provided under the original contract. As a result, the Company in effect established a new contract that included only the remaining digital content or magazines. Accordingly, the Company allocated the remaining performance obligations in the contracts as consideration from the original contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at banks where amounts on deposit may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit during the year. Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments with an original contractual maturity at the date of purchase of three months. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of checking, savings deposits and money market accounts. These deposits exceeded federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk regarding its cash and cash equivalents.

The following table reconciles total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash:

|                                                   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                                   | 2020                 | 2019                 |
| Cash and cash equivalents                         | $ 9,033,872          | $ 8,852,281          |
| Restricted cash                                   | 500,809              | 620,809              |
| Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | $ 9,534,681          | $ 9,473,090          |

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had restricted cash of $500,809, which serves as collateral for certain credit card merchant accounts with a bank. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had restricted cash of $620,809 of which (1) $500,000 served as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit for a security deposit for office space leased at 14 Wall Street, 15th Floor, New York, New York (see Note 7), and (2) $120,809 served as collateral for certain credit card merchant accounts with a bank.

## Accounts Receivable

The Company receives payments from advertising customers based upon contractual payment terms; accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected within 90 days. The Company generally receives payments from digital and print subscription customers at the time of sign up for each subscription; accounts receivable from merchant credit card processors are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected weekly. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $16,497,626 and $16,233,955, respectively, are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $892,352 and $287,902, respectively

## Subscription Acquisition Costs

Subscription acquisition costs include the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, paid to external parties, if it expects to recover those costs. The Company has determined that sales commissions paid on all third-party agent sales of subscriptions are direct and incremental and, therefore, meet the capitalization criteria. Direct mail costs also meet the requirements to be capitalized as assets if they are proven to be recoverable. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are amortized as revenue is recognized or over the term of the agreement.

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract also included contract fulfillment costs related to the revenue share to the Publisher Partners. The contract fulfillment costs were amortized over the same period as the associated revenue. The Company records incremental costs of obtaining a contract as subscription acquisition costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company had no asset impairment charges related to the subscription acquisition costs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The Contract Modifications resulted in subscription acquisition costs to be recognized on a prospective basis in the same proportion as the revenue that has not yet been recognized.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, subscription acquisition costs were $41,505,480 (short-term of $28,146,895 and long-term of $13,358,585) and $6,560,058 (shortterm of $3,142,580 and long-term of $3,417,478), respectively. Subscription acquisition cost as of December 31, 2020 presented as current assets of $28,146,895 are expected to be amortized during the year ending December 31, 2021 and $13,358,585 presented as long-term assets are expected to be amortized after the year ending December 31, 2021.

## Concentrations

Significant Customers - Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to customers to whom the Company makes significant sales. While a reserve for the potential write-off of accounts receivable is maintained, the Company has not written off any significant accounts to date. To control credit risk, the Company performs regular credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

Revenue from significant customers as a percentage of the Company's total revenue are as follows:

|            | Years Ended December 31,   | Years Ended December 31,   |
|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
|            | 2020                       | 2019                       |
| Customer 1 | -                          | 22.4 %                     |

There were no significant accounts receivable balances as a percentage of the Company's total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Significant Vendors - Concentrations of risk with respect to third party vendors who provide products and services to the Company are limited. If not limited, such concentrations could impact profitability if a vendor failed to fulfill their obligations or if a significant vendor was unable to renew an existing contract and the Company was not able to replace the related product or service at the same cost.

F-18

Significant accounts payable balances as a percentage of the Company's total accounts payable are as follows:

|            | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|            | 2020                 | 2019                 |
| Vendor 1 * |                      | 61.7 %               |

- * The significant accounts payable balance as of December 31, 2019 related to the service agreements with Meredith Corporation ("Meredith") (as described in Note 3).

## Leases

The Company has various lease arrangements for certain equipment and its offices. Leases are recorded as an operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. At inception, the Company determines whether an arrangement that provides control over the use of an asset is a lease. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the renewal period, the Company includes the impact of the renewal in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulativeeffect adjustment. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are or contain a lease, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases as of the adoption date. The Company did not elect to apply the hindsight practical expedient when determining lease term and assessing impairment of right-ofuse assets. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of $1,003,221, lease liabilities for operating leases of $1,069,745, with no cumulative effect adjustment on retained earnings on its consolidated balance sheets, and with no material impact to its consolidated statements of operations (as further described in Note 7).

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in the statement of operations when realized. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

| Office equipment and computers   | 1 - 3 years                                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Furniture and fixtures           | 1 - 5 years                                              |
| Leasehold improvements           | Shorter of remaining lease term or estimated useful life |

## Platform Development

In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company capitalizes platform development costs for internal use when planning and design efforts are successfully completed, and development is ready to commence. The Company places capitalized platform development assets into service and commences amortization when the applicable project or asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Once placed into service, the Company capitalizes qualifying costs of specified upgrades or enhancements to capitalized platform development assets when the upgrade or enhancement will result in new or additional functionality.

## F-19

The Company capitalizes internal labor costs, including payroll-based and stock-based compensation, benefits and payroll taxes, that are incurred for certain capitalized platform development projects related to the Company's technology platform. The Company's policy with respect to capitalized internal labor stipulates that labor costs for employees working on eligible internal use capital projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of the project when the impact, as compared to expensing such labor costs, is material.

Platform development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which is the estimated useful life of the related asset and is recorded in cost of revenues on the consolidated statements of operations.

## Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that the purchase price, including the fair value of contingent consideration, of the acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the estimated fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Company's estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent the Company identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company identifies acquisition-related contingent payments and determines their respective fair values as of the acquisition date, which are recorded as accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent payments are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company expenses transaction costs related to the acquisition as incurred.

## Intangible Assets

Intangibles with finite lives, consisting of developed technology and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. A finite lived intangible asset is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Intangibles with an indefinite useful life are not being amortized.

## Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily by reference to the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually on December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 (as further described below under the heading Recent Accounting Pronouncements ) during the first quarter of 2020 which eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The Company operates as one reporting unit, therefore, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the Company to its carrying value. The Company has elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis of determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of the Company's single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.

## Deferred Financing Costs and Discounts on Debt Obligations

Deferred financing costs consist of cash and noncash consideration paid to lenders and third parties with respect to convertible debt and other financing transactions, including legal fees and placement agent fees. Such costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt. Upon the settlement of debt or conversion of convertible debt into common stock, under certain circumstances, the pro rata portion of any related unamortized deferred financing costs are charged to operations.

Additional consideration in the form of warrants and other derivative financial instruments issued to lenders is accounted for at fair value utilizing information determined by consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm. The fair value of warrants and derivatives are recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of such debt, with the initial offsetting entries recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Upon the settlement or conversion of convertible debt into common stock, under certain circumstances, the pro rata portion of any related unamortized discount on debt is charged to operations.

Amortization of debt discount during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $6,607,212 and $4,545,675, respectively.

## Liquidated Damages

Liquidated damages are provided as a result of the following: (i) certain registration rights agreements provide for damages if the Company does not register certain shares of the Company's common stock within the requisite time frame (the "Registration Rights Damages"); and (ii) certain securities purchase agreements provide for damages if the Company does not maintain its periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") within the requisite time frame (the "Public Information Failure Damages"). Obligations with respect to the Registration Rights Damages and the Public Information Failure Damages (collectively, the "Liquidated Damages") are accounted for as contingent obligations when it is deemed probable the obligations would not be satisfied at the time a financing is completed and are subsequently reviewed at each quarter-end reporting date thereafter. When such quarterly review indicates that it is probable that the Liquidated Damages will be incurred, the Company records an estimate of each such obligation at the balance sheet date based on the amount due of such obligation. The Company reviews and revises such estimates at each quarter-end date based on updated information.

F-21

## Selling and Marketing

Selling and marketing expenses consist of compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation of selling and marketing, account management support teams, as well as commissions, travel, trade show sponsorships and events, conferences and advertising costs. The Company's advertising expenses relate to direct-mail costs for magazine subscription acquisition efforts, print, and digital advertising. Advertising costs that are not capitalized are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred advertising expenses of $3,583,116 and $859,802, respectively, which are included within selling and marketing on the consolidated statements of operations.

## General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll for executive personnel, technology personnel incurred in developing conceptual formulation and determination of existence of needed technology, and administrative personnel along with any related payroll costs; professional services, including accounting, legal and insurance; facilities costs; conferences; other general corporate expenses; and stock-based compensation of related personnel.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for freestanding contracts that are settled in the Company's equity securities, including common stock warrants, to be designated as an equity instrument, and generally as a liability. A contract so designated is carried at fair value on a company's balance sheet, with any changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in a company's results of operations.

The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect any material changes in fair value, with any such changes classified as changes in derivatives valuation in the statement of operations. The calculation of the fair value of derivatives utilizes highly subjective and theoretical assumptions that can materially affect fair values from period to period. The recognition of these derivative amounts does not have any impact on cash flows.

At the date of exercise of any of the warrants, or the conversion of any convertible debt or preferred stock into common stock, the pro rata fair value of the related warrant liability and any embedded derivative liability is transferred to additional paid-in capital.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The authoritative guidance with respect to fair value established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded securities and exchange-based derivatives.

Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds and are measured using present value pricing models.

The Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.

The carrying amount of the Company's financial instruments comprising of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

## Preferred Stock

Preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock") (as described in Note 20) is reported as a mezzanine obligation between liabilities and stockholders' equity. If it becomes probable that the Preferred Stock will become redeemable, the Company will re-measure the Preferred Stock by adjusting the carrying value to the redemption value of the Preferred Stock assuming each balance sheet date is a redemption date.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company provides stock-based compensation in the form of (a) stock awards to employees and directors, comprised of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, (b) stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, (c) common stock warrants to Publisher Partners (further details are provided under the heading Publisher Partner Warrants in Note 22), and (d) common stock warrants to ABG (further details are provided under the heading ABG Warrants in Note 22).

The Company accounts for stock awards and stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the stock-based payments as compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are timevested, are measured at fair value on the grant date, and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are performance-vested, are measured at fair value on the grant date and charged to operations when the performance condition is satisfied.

The Publisher Partner Warrants granted are subject to a performance condition, which is generally based on the average number of unique visitors on the channel operated by the Publisher Partner generated during the six-month period from the launch of the Publisher Partner's operations on Maven's platform or the revenue generated during the period from issuance date through a specified end date. The Company recognizes expense for these Publisher Partner Warrants as the services are received. The Company has specific objective criteria for determination of the period over which services are received and expense is recognized.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, the Company accounted for stock-based payments to certain directors and consultants, and Publisher Partners (collectively the "non-employee awards") by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon the measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the later of the adoption date of ASU 2018-07, or the date of grant, without change in the fair value of the award. There was no cumulative effect of adoption of ASU 2018-07 on January 1, 2019. For stock-based awards granted to non-employees subject to graded vesting that only contain service conditions, the Company has elected to recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line recognition method.

## F-23

The fair value measurement of equity awards and grants used for stock-based compensation is as follows: (1) restricted stock awards and restricted stock units which are time-vested, are determined using the quoted market price of the Company's common stock at the grant date; (2) stock option grants which are time-vested and performance-vested, are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date; (3) restricted stock awards which provide for performancevesting and a true-up provision, are determined through consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm using the binomial pricing model at the grant date; (4) stock option grants which provide for market-based vesting with a time-vesting overlay, are determined through consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date; (5) Publisher Partner Warrants are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model; and (6) ABG warrants are determined utilizing the Monte Carlo model (further details are provided in Note 22).

Fair value determined under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo model is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option or warrants, as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock and is evaluated based upon market comparisons. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company's common stock.

The fair value of the stock options granted were probability weighted effective January 1, 2019 under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or Monte Carlo model as determined through consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm since the value of the stock options, among other things, depend on the volatility of the underlying shares of the Company's common stock, under the following two scenarios: (1) scenario one assumes that the Company's common stock will be up-listed on a national stock exchange (the "Exchange") on a certain listing date (the "Up-list"); and (2) scenario two assumes that the Company's common stock is not up-listed on the Exchange prior to the final vesting date of the grants (the "No Up-list"), collectively referred to as the "Probability Weighted Scenarios".

The Company classifies stock-based compensation in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's cash compensation cost is classified.

## Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement bases of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in the income tax rates on deferred tax asset and liability balances is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such rate change. A valuation allowance is recorded for loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that such loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company follows accounting guidance that sets forth a threshold for financial statement recognition, measurement, and disclosure of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Such guidance requires the Company to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits of the position.

F-24

## Loss per Common Share

stock equivalent shares, such as stock options, restricted stock, and warrants. All restricted stock awards are considered outstanding but is included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable and, thus, are vested. All restricted stock units are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the underlying restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable and, thus, are vested. Contingently issuable shares are included in basic loss per common share only when there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued. Diluted loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.

The Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below (capitalized terms are described herein), which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, from its calculation of net income loss per common share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2016, the FASB ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which introduces a new model for recognizing credit losses for certain financial instruments, including loans, accounts receivable and debt securities. The new model requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the life of exposure to be recorded through the establishment of an allowance account, which is presented as an offset to the related financial asset. The expected credit loss is recorded upon the initial recognition of the financial asset. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. No impact on the consolidated financial statements was recorded as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The Step 2 test requires an entity to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, an entity will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value determined in Step 1. This update also eliminates the qualitative assessment requirements for a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying value. Prospective adoption is required and the Company adopted ASU 2017-04 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. No impact on the consolidated financial statements was recorded as a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-04.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement , which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements. The update removes, modifies, and adds certain additional disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update required a change in disclosures and had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. Certain amendments in this update must be applied on a prospective basis, certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective basis, and certain amendments must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. ASU 2019-12 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , which updates various codification topics to simplify the accounting guidance for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, with a specific focus on convertible instruments and the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and amends the diluted EPS computation for these instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-06 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20 - Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs , which clarifies that a reporting entity should assess whether a callable debt security purchased at a premium is within the scope of ASC 310-20-35-33 each reporting period, which impacts the amortization period for nonrefundable fees and other costs. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-08 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements , which updates various codification topics by clarifying or improving disclosure requirements to align with the SEC's regulations. The Company will adopt ASU 2020-10 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding EquityClassified Written Call Options, a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF), to provide explicit guidance on accounting by issuers for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options that remain equity classified after the modification or exchange. ASU 2021-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its consolidated financial statements.

## 3. Acquisitions

## 2020 Acquisitions

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which is based on ASC, Business Combinations (Topic 805) , and uses the fair value concepts which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.

On March 9, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Petametrics Inc., dba LiftIgniter, a Delaware corporation ("LiftIgniter"), where it purchased substantially all the assets, including the intellectual property and excluding certain accounts receivable, and assumed certain liabilities. The purchase price consisted of: (1) cash payment of $184,087 on February 19, 2020, in connection with the repayment of all outstanding indebtedness, (2) at closing, a cash payment of $131,202, (3) collections of certain accounts receivable, (4) on the first anniversary date of the closing issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock, and (5) on the second anniversary date of the closing, issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock.

The composition of the purchase price is as follows:

| Cash                                                        | 315,289   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Indemnity restricted stock units for shares of common stock | 500,000   |
| Total purchase consideration                                | 815,289   |

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Accounts receivable   | $ 37,908    |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Developed technology  | 917,762     |
| Accounts payable      | (53,494 ) ) |
| Unearned revenue      | (86,887     |
| Net assets acquired   | $ 815,289   |

The useful life for the developed technology is three years (3.0 years).

## 2019 Acquisitions

TheStreet, Inc. - On June 11, 2019, the Company, TST Acquisition Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TSTAC"), a newly-formed indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and TheStreet, entered into an agreement and plan of merger, as amended (the "TheStreet Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which TSTAC merged with and into TheStreet, with TheStreet continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("TheStreet Merger"). TheStreet Merger Agreement provided that all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of TheStreet would be exchanged for an aggregate of $16,500,000 in cash. Pursuant to the terms of TheStreet Merger Agreement, on June 10, 2019, the Company deposited $16,500,000 into an escrow account pursuant to an escrow agreement.

F-27

On August 7, 2019, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of TheStreet for total cash consideration of $16,500,000, pursuant to TheStreet Merger Agreement. The results of operation of the acquired business and the estimated fair market values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. TheStreet's addition to the Company's premium media coalition highlights its strategic growth and adds a flagship to the portfolio of major media brands. The Company acquired TheStreet to enhance the user's experience by increasing content through the Company's industry-leading technology, distribution and monetization platform. TheStreet is a digital financial media company that provides reporting on investment trends and analysis and operates a network of 28 premium content channels that act as an open community for writers, explorers, knowledge seekers and conversation starters to connect in an interactive and informative online space. In connection with TheStreet Merger, the Company entered into an arrangement with a co-founder to continue certain services (further details are provided under the heading Cramer Digital, Inc. Agreement in Note 25). TheStreet operates primarily in the United States.

The Company funded the cash consideration pursuant to TheStreet Merger from the net proceeds from the 12% Senior Secured Note financing (as described in Note 19).

The Company incurred $199,630 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of banking, legal, accounting and valuation-related expenses. The acquisition related expenses were recorded within general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Accounts receivable           | 1,586,031    |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Prepaid expenses              | 1,697,347    |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal, as well as other available market data, to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the intangible assets were determined as follows: developed technology was determined under the cost approach with a useful life of three years (3.0 years); trade name was determined using the relief from royalty method of the income approach with a useful life of twenty years (20.0 years); subscriber relationships and advertising relationships were determined using the multiperiod excess earnings method of the income approach with a useful life of eight and four tenths years (8.4 years) and nine and four tenths years (9.4 years), respectively; and data base was determined using the replacement cost method of the cost approach with a useful life of fifteen years (15.0 years). The weighted-average useful life for the intangible assets is eight and six tenths years (8.6 years). The fair value of the unearned revenues was determined with the following inputs: (1) projection of when unearned revenue will be earned; (2) expense necessary to fulfill the subscriptions; (3) gross up of the fulfillment costs to include a market participant level of profitability; (4) slight premium to the fulfillment-costs plus a reasonable profit metric; and (5) reduce projected future cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate.

## F-28

The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. The Company believes the factors that contributed to goodwill include the acquisition of a talented workforce that expands the Company's expertise and synergies that are specific to the Company's consolidated business and not available to market participants.

Licensing Agreement with ABG-SI LLC - On June 14, 2019, the Company and ABG, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Authentic Brands Group, entered into the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, pursuant to which the Company has the exclusive right and license in the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand to operate the Sports Illustrated media business (in the English and Spanish languages), including to (i) operate the digital and print editions of Sports Illustrated (including all special interest issues and the swimsuit issue) and Sports Illustrated for Kids , (ii) develop new digital media channels under the Sports Illustrated brands, and (iii) operate certain related businesses, including without limitation, special interest publications, video channels, bookazines and the licensing and/or syndication of certain products and content under the Sports Illustrated brand (collectively, the "Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands").

The initial term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement commenced on October 4, 2019 upon the termination of the Meredith License Agreement (as defined below) and continues through December 31, 2029. The Company has the option, subject to certain conditions, to renew the term of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement for nine consecutive renewal terms of 10 years each (collectively with the initial term, the "Term"), for a total of 100 years. The Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement provides that the Company will pay to ABG annual royalties in respect of each year of the Term based on gross revenues ("Royalties") with guaranteed minimum annual amounts. On the execution of the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, the Company prepaid ABG $45,000,000 against future Royalties upon (see Note 5). In addition, ABG will pay to the Company a share of revenues relating to certain Sports Illustrated business lines not licensed to the Company, such as all gambling-related advertising and monetization, events, and commerce. The Company funded the prepaid Royalties from the net proceeds from the 12% Senior Secured Notes financing (as described in Note 19). The Company entered into the Licensing Agreement as part of its growth strategy to serve as a cornerstone of vertical content.

Pursuant to a publicly announced agreement, dated May 24, 2019, between ABG and Meredith, Meredith previously operated the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands under license from ABG (the "Meredith License Agreement"). On October 3, 2019, Maven and Meredith entered into a Transition Services Agreement and an Outsourcing Agreement (collectively, the "Transition Agreement"), whereby the parties agreed to the terms and conditions under which Meredith continued to operate certain aspects of the business and provide certain services during the fourth quarter of 2019 as all activities were transitioned over to Maven. Through these agreements, Maven took over operating control of the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands, and the Transition Agreement was terminated.

In connection with the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, the Company issued ABG warrants to acquire common stock of the Company (the "ABG Warrants") for performance of future services (see Note 22).

As consideration for entering into the Licensing Agreement, the Company agreed to retain the responsibility and lead the negotiations with Meredith to provide for the transfer of the Sports Illustrated Licensed Brands from Meredith, including an arrangement where Meredith retains responsibility for producing and distributing the physical publications Sports Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Kids (the "Magazines") and subscriber marketing, as well as to retain responsibility for paying the deferred subscription revenue, described in the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement, as the total liability to subscribers to fulfill unfulfilled subscriptions to the print and electronic editions of the Magazines, accrued as of October 4, 2019, and the obligation to issue to each subscriber requesting a refund in connection therewith the amount of such liability owing to that subscriber. No cash was paid to ABG in connection with the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement.

The Company concluded that the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement entered into to conduct the licensed brands was an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, Subtopic 50 , Related Issues (ASC 805-50), as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired by the Company is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. All direct acquisition related costs of $331,026 are assigned to the assets in relation to the relative fair value of the acquired assets and recorded as part of the consideration transferred.

F-29

In accordance with the above guidance, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the effective date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values are summarized below:

| Accounts receivable           | $ 337,481     |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Prepaid expenses              | 1,534,922     |
| Subscriber relationships      | 71,308,799    |
| Other current liabilities     | (632,056 )    |
| Unearned revenues             | (47,249,470 ) |
| Subscription refund liability | (5,427,523 )  |
| Deferred tax liabilities      | (19,541,127 ) |
| Net assets acquired           | $ 331,026     |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal, as well as other available market data, to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the intangible asset was determined by an independent appraisal in accordance with ASC 805-50 by allocating the fair value of an assumed liability to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values, with the fair value of the assumed liabilities (or unearned revenues and subscription refund liability) assigned to the subscriber relationships asset as the subscribers are sufficiently similar and can be valued together as a single identifiable asset acquired. The fair value of the unearned revenues was determined with the following inputs: (1) projection of when unearned revenue will be earned; (2) expense necessary to fulfill the subscriptions; (3) gross up of the fulfillment costs to include a market participant level of profitability; (4) slight premium to the fulfillment-costs plus a reasonable profit metric; and (5) reduce projected future cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The fair value of the subscription refund liability was established based upon the historical return rates for specific products. The subscriber relationships (the customer-based intangible assets) useful life was determined by establishing the average term of the issues served taking into account expected subscription renewals, which is five years (5.0 years).

The Company concluded and recognized deferred tax liabilities, consistent with the guidance for an asset acquisition, at the Licensing Agreement effective date in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes , based on the difference between the book and tax basis of the assets acquired calculated under the simultaneous equation model using the initial measurement guidance in accordance with ASC 805.

The Royalties are being recognized over a period of three-years starting October 4, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the current portion of $15,000,000 was reflected within royalty fees on the consolidated balance sheets and the long-term portion of $11,250,000 and $26,250,000, respectively, was reflected within royalty fees, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheets.

No impairment charges have been recorded in the periods presented.

## 7. Leases

The Company adopted the comprehensive new lease accounting standard effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. The Company elected the package of practical expedients under the new lease standards, which includes (i) not reassessing whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease, (ii) not reassessing lease classification for any expired or existing leases, (iii) not reassessing initial direct costs for any existing leases, and (iv) account for a lease and non-lease component as a single component for certain classes of assets. The Company will not adopt the practical expedient to use hindsight in determining the lease term. Adoption of the new standard resulted in recording operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of the standard was immaterial and did not result in an impact as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company's leases are primarily comprised of real estate leases for the use of office space, with certain lease arrangements that contain equipment. The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Substantially all of the leases are long-term operating leases for facilities with fixed payment terms between 1.5 and 12.8 years, which expire at various dates through 2032.

The table below presents supplemental information related to operating leases:

|                                                                                              | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                                                                              | 2020                      | 2019                      |
| Operating lease costs during the year                                                        | $ 4,054,423               | $ 1,112,362               |
| Cash payments included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities during the year     | $ 3,188,986               | $ 1,212,800               |
| Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining lease right-of-use assets during the year | $ 16,617,790              | $ 3,853,500               |
| Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) as of year-end                              | 11.25                     | 5.03                      |
| Weighted-average discount rate during the year                                               | 13.57 %                   | 9.85 %                    |

As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate used is the rate the Company would have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

## F-31

On February 7, 2020, under the terms of the first amendment to the 12% Amended Senior Secured Notes (as further amended and described in Note 19), BRF Finance Co., LLC ("BRF Finance"), an affiliated entity of B. Riley, issued a letter of credit for $3,024,232 to one of the Company's landlords. In the event BRF Finance is required to make a draw on the letter of credit, the amount paid will automatically be added to principal of the outstanding notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, security deposits under letters of credit or cash deposited with banks under the terms of the lease arrangements were $185,606 and $160,910, respectively, reflected within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

## Maturity of Lease Liabilities

The Company performs its annual impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. Management determined that the Company would be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company as part of its annual evaluations utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors which include, but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of its reporting unit. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of its reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying amount. The annual impairment test was performed on December 31, 2020. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

## 12. Restricted Stock Liabilities

- โ the restricted stock awards ceased to vest and all unvested shares were deemed unvested and forfeited, leaving an aggregate of 1,064,549 shares vested;
- โ the restricted stock units were modified to vest on December 31, 2020, and as of the close of business on December 31, 2020, each restricted stock unit was terminated and deemed forfeited, with no shares vesting thereunder; and
- โ subject to certain conditions, the Company agreed to purchase the vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, at a price of $4.00 per share in 24 equal monthly installments on the second business day of each calendar month beginning on January 4, 2021.

The carrying value of the Company's 12% Amended Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) approximates fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, their fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

The quantitative information utilized in the fair value calculation of the Level 3 liabilities are as follows:

The Company accounts for certain warrants and the embedded conversion features of the 12% Convertible Debentures (as described in Note 18) as derivative liabilities, which require the Company carry such amounts on its consolidated balance sheets as a liability at fair value, as adjusted at each reporting period-end.

The Company determined the fair value of the L2 Warrants, Strome Warrants and B. Riley Warrants (all as described in Note 21) utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model as further described below. These warrants and the embedded conversion features are classified as Level 3 within the fair-value hierarchy. Inputs to the valuation model include the Company's publicly-quoted stock price, the stock volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the remaining life of the warrants and debentures, the exercise price or conversion price, and the dividend rate. The Company uses the closing stock price of its common stock over an appropriate period of time to compute stock volatility. These assumptions are summarized as follows:

F-36

L2 Warrants 2019 assumptions: Black-Scholes option-pricing; expected life: 3.75 years; risk-free interest rate: 1.56%; volatility factor: 130.46%; dividend rate: 0.0%; transaction date closing market price: $0.89; exercise price: $0.50.

Strome Warrants 2020 assumptions: Black-Scholes option-pricing; expected life: 2.45; risk-free interest rate: 0.13%; volatility factor: 150.55%; dividend rate: 0.0%; transaction date closing market price: $0.60; exercise price: $0.50; and 2019 assumptions: Black-Scholes option-pricing; expected life: 3.45; risk-free interest rate: 1.62%; volatility factor: 144.56%; dividend rate: 0.0%; transaction date closing market price: $0.80; exercise price: $4.50.

B. Riley Warrants 2020 assumptions: Black-Scholes option-pricing; expected life: 4.79 years; risk-free interest rate: 0.36%; volatility factor: 140.95%; dividend rate: 0.0%; transaction date closing market price: $0.60; exercise price: $1.00; and 2019 assumptions: Black-Scholes option-pricing; expected life: 5.80 years; risk-free interest rate: 1.76%; volatility factor: 127.63%; dividend rate: 0.0%; transaction date closing market price:$0.80; exercise price: $1.00.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in valuation of embedded derivative liabilities as described in the above table of $2,571,004 was recognized as other income on the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the change in valuation of embedded derivative liabilities as described in the above table of $5,040,000 was recognized as other expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

In addition, the fair value requirement at each period-end for the Series G Preferred Stock embedded conversion feature was no longer required for the year ended December 31, 2019 since it is not considered a derivative liability, therefore, the carrying amount of $72,563 as of January 1, 2018 was recognized as other income of $72,563 during the year ended December 31, 2019 on the consolidated statements of operations.

As a result of the conversion of certain 12% Convertible Debentures into shares of the Company's common stock, the Company recorded the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of the conversion option features, buy-in features, and default remedy features of $10,929,996 within additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statements of stockholders' deficiency (as further described in Note 18).

There have been no transfers in Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 and no changes in valuation techniques for these assets or liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

## 17. Promissory Notes

In May 2018, the Company's then Chief Executive Officer began advancing funds to the Company in order to meet minimum operating needs. Such advances were made pursuant to promissory notes that were due on demand, with interest at the minimum applicable federal rate, which ranged from 2.18% to 2.38%. As of December 31, 2019, the total principal amount of advances outstanding were $319,351 (including accrued interest of $12,574) (see Note 25). As of December 31, 2020, the note was repaid (further details are provided in Note 20).

## 18. Convertible Debt

During 2018 and 2019, the Company had various financings through the issuance of the 12% senior subordinated convertible debentures which were due and payable on December 31, 2020 (the "12% Convertible Debentures"). Interest accrued at the rate of 12% per annum, payable on the earlier of conversion or December 31, 2020. The Company's obligations under the 12% Convertible Debentures were secured by a security agreement, dated as of October 18, 2018, by and among the Company and each investor thereto. The 12% Convertible Debentures were subject to the Company receiving stockholder approval to increase its authorized shares of common stock before conversion. Principal on the 12% Convertible Debentures were convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, at the option of the investor at any time prior to December 31, 2020, at either a per share conversion price of $0.33 (with respect to the 12% Convertible Debentures issued in 2018) or $0.40 (with respect to the 12% Convertible Debentures issued in 2019), subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions, and certain beneficial ownership blocker provisions. Further, the 12% Convertible Debentures were subject to Liquidated Damages (as further described below and in Note 23 and Note 26).

## F-38

The 12% Convertible Debentures were issued and convertible into shares of the Company's common stock as follows: (1) gross proceeds of $13,091,528 on December 12, 2018, convertible into 39,671,297 shares; (2) gross proceeds of $1,696,000 on March 18, 2019, convertible into 4,240,000 shares; (3) gross proceeds of $318,000 on March 27, 2019, convertible into 795,000 shares; and (4) gross proceeds of $100,000 on April 8, 2019, convertible into 250,000 shares. Upon issuance of the various financings, the Company accounted for the embedded conversion option feature, buy-in feature, and default remedy feature (as further described below and in Note 16) as embedded derivative liabilities, which required the Company to carry such amount on its consolidated balance sheets as a liability at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end (see Note 16).

The Company also incurred debt issuance cost. The embedded derivative liabilities and debt issuance cost were treated as a debt discount and amortized over the term of the debt.

The 12% Convertible Debentures issued during the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:

On March 18, 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with two accredited investors, including John Fichthorn, the Company's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), pursuant to which the Company issued 12% Convertible Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $1,696,000, which included a placement fee of $96,000 paid to B. Riley FBR in the form of a 12% Convertible Debenture, for acting as the Company's placement agent in the offering. The Company received net proceeds of $1,600,000 and paid legal fees and expenses of $10,000 in cash. This financing of the 12% Convertible Debentures was subject to an issuance limitation, which fully limited the conversion of the 12% Convertible Debentures into shares of common stock by the holders (outside of the issuance limitation these 12% Convertible Debentures were convertible into 4,240,000 shares of the Company's common stock), subject to certain conditions as described below.

On March 27, 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company issued 12% Convertible Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $318,000, which included a placement fee of $18,000 paid to B. Riley FBR in the form of a 12% Convertible Debenture for acting as the Company's placement agent in the offering. The Company received net proceeds of $300,000. This financing of the 12% Convertible Debentures was subject to an issuance limitation, which fully limited the conversion of the 12% Convertible Debentures into shares of common stock by the holder (outside of the issuance limitation these 12% Convertible Debentures were convertible into 795,000 shares of the Company's common stock), subject to certain conditions as described below.

On April 8, 2019, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, Todd D. Sims, a member of the Board, pursuant to which the Company issued a 12% Convertible Debenture in the aggregate principal amount of $100,000 and received $100,000 from the proceeds. This financing of the 12% Convertible Debenture was subject to an issuance limitation, which fully limited the conversion of the 12% Convertible Debentures into shares of common stock by the holder (outside of the issuance limitation this 12% Convertible Debenture was convertible into 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock), subject to certain conditions as described below.

Upon issuance of the various financings of the 12% Convertible Debentures, the Company recognized the following embedded derivative liabilities that were bifurcated from the note instruments:

- โ Conversion option - (1) At any time after the original issue date until the 12% Convertible Debenture is no longer outstanding, the 12% Convertible Debenture is convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of common stock at the option of the holder at the aforementioned conversion price, and (2) at any time and from time to time subject to: (i) an issuance limitation until the Company has an authorized share increase, and (ii) a beneficial ownership limitations, which prevents conversion if the common stock shares held by the holder exceeds 4.99% of the common stock outstanding (subject to increase by the holder to 9.99%).
- โ Buy-in feature - (1) The 12% Convertible Debenture is puttable for a certain buy-in amount where it gives the holder the right, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the holder the conversion shares, to a cash settlement for the difference between the cost of the Company's common stock in the open market and the conversion price; and (2) the put is contingent if the Company fails to deliver conversion shares pursuant to a buy-in event.

## F-39

- โ Default remedy feature - (1) The 12% Convertible Debenture is puttable in the event of default where it gives the holder the right to repayment, in cash, the greater of (i) the outstanding principal amount due divided by the then conversion price times the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock; or (ii) the outstanding principal debt amount, plus unpaid but accrued interest and other amounts owing in the notes; and (2) the put is contingent upon a Change of Control (as described below) or Fundamental Transaction (as described below).

Change in Control - Change in Control, in general, means: (a) an acquisition in excess of 50% of the voting securities of the Company; (b) the Company merges into or consolidates whereby the Company stockholders own less than 50% of the aggregate voting power after the transaction; (c) the Company sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to whereby the Company stockholders own less than 50% of the aggregate voting power after the transaction; (d) a replacement at one time or within a three year period of more than one-half of the Board, which is not approved by a majority of those individuals who are members of the Board on the original

issue date, subject to certain conditions; or (e) the execution by the Company of an agreement for any of the events set forth in clauses (a) through (d) above.

Fundamental Transaction - Fundamental Transaction, in general, means: (a) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation; (b) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions; (c) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer is completed pursuant to which the Company common stock holders are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock; (d) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Company's common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (e) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination whereby such transaction results in an acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain other conditions. Further, if a Fundamental Transaction occurs, the holders have the right to their conversion shares as if the beneficial ownership limitation or the issuance limitation was not in place, subject to certain terms as additional consideration.

The 12% Convertible Debentures also provided that as long as the debt remains outstanding, unless investors holding at least 51% in principal amount of the thenoutstanding 12% Convertible Debentures otherwise agree, the Company was not permitted to enter into, incur, assume or guarantee any indebtedness, except for certain permitted indebtedness.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the securities purchase agreements, the Company agreed to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the 12% Convertible Debentures for resale by the holders within a certain timeframe and subject to certain conditions. The registration rights agreement provides for a cash payment equal to 1.0% per month of the amount invested as partial liquidated damages upon the occurrence of certain events, on each monthly anniversary, up to a maximum amount of 6.0% of the aggregate amount invested, subject to interest at 12.0% per annum, accruing daily, until paid in full. The registration rights agreements provide for Registration Rights Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The securities purchase agreements also included a provision that requires the Company to maintain its periodic filings with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act. If the Company fails for any reason to satisfy the current public information requirement after 6 months of the closing date, then the Company will be obligated to pay to each holder a cash payment equal to 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested for each 30-day period, or pro rata portion thereof, as partial liquidated damages per month, up to a maximum of 6 months, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full. The securities purchase agreements provide for Public Information Failure Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

## F-40

The Company recognized a portion of the Public Information Failure Damages pursuant to the securities purchase agreements in connection with the 12% Convertible Debentures at the time of issuance as it was deemed probable the obligations would not be satisfied when the financings were completed (see Note 15 and Note 26).

On December 31, 2020, certain holders converted the 12% Convertible Debentures representing an aggregate of $18,104,949 of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into 53,887,470 shares of the Company's common stock at effective conversion per-share prices ranging from $0.33 to $0.40. Further, the Company repaid an aggregate of $1,130,903 of the 12% Convertible Debentures, including the then-outstanding principal and accrued interest, in cash. With respect to the conversion of the accrued interest into shares of the Company's common stock, the Company recognized a loss on conversion of $3,297,539 at the time of conversion on the consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion of the 12% Convertible Debentures, the Company recorded the aggregate outstanding principal and loss on conversion of the accrued interest of $21,402,488 within additional paid-capital on the consolidated statements of stockholders' deficiency.

The following table represents the various financings of the 12% Convertible Debentures recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and carrying value as of December 31, 2019:

## 19. Long-term Debt

## 12% Senior Secured Note

On June 10, 2019, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with one accredited investor, BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, pursuant to which the Company issued to the investor a 12% senior secured note, due July 31, 2019 (the "12% Senior Secured Note"), in the aggregate principal amount of $20,000,000, which after taking into account a B. Riley FBR placement fee of $1,000,000 and legal fees and expenses of the investor of $135,000, resulted in the Company receiving net proceeds of $18,865,000, of which $16,500,000 was deposited into escrow to fund TheStreet Merger consideration and the balance of $2,365,000 was to be used by

the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The balance outstanding under the note purchase agreement was no longer outstanding as of June 14, 2019 (refer to 12% Amended Senior Secured Notes below).

## 12% Amended Senior Secured Notes

On June 14, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated note purchase agreement with one accredited investor, BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, which amended and restated the note purchase agreement and the 12% Senior Secured Note issued by the Company thereunder. All borrowings under the amended and restated note purchase agreement are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. Pursuant to the amended and restated note purchase agreement, the Company issued an amended and restated 12% senior secured note, due June 14, 2022, in the aggregate principal amount of $68,000,000, which amended, restated, and superseded that $20,000,000 12% Senior Secured Note issued by the Company to the investor (the "12% Amended Senior Secured Note(s)").

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Series G Preferred Stock

On May 30, 2000, the Company sold 1,800 shares of its Series G Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series G Preferred Stock"), of which 1,631.504 were converted prior to November 2001 and 168.496 shares continue to be outstanding, at a stated value of $1,000 per share, convertible into 188,791 shares of the Company's common stock. The Series G Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock, at the option of the holder, subject to certain limitations. The Company may require holders to convert all (but not less than all) of the Series G Preferred Stock or buy out all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the liquidation value of $168,496. Holders of Series G Preferred Stock are not entitled to dividends and have no voting rights, unless required by law or with respect to certain matters relating to the Series G Preferred Stock.

## F-45

Upon a change in control, sale of or similar transaction, as defined in the Certificate of Designation for the Series G Preferred Stock, the holder of the Series G Preferred Stock has the option to deem such transaction as a liquidation and may redeem their 168.496 shares at the liquidation value of $1,000 per share, or an aggregate amount of $168,496. The sale of all the assets of the Company on June 28, 2007 triggered the redemption option. As such redemption was not in the control of the Company, the Series G Preferred Stock has been accounted for as if it is redeemable preferred stock and is classified on the consolidated balance sheets as a mezzanine obligation between liabilities and stockholders' equity.

## Series H Preferred Stock

On August 10, 2018 (the "Closing Date"), the Company closed on a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued an aggregate of 19,400 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series H Preferred Stock") at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 58,787,879 shares of the Company's common stock, at the option of the holder subject to certain limitations, at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $19,399,250 (net proceeds of $18,045,496 after taking into consideration issuance costs).

Between August 14, 2020 and August 20, 2020, the Company entered into additional securities purchase agreements for the sale of Series H Preferred Stock with accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued 108 shares (after it rescinded the issuance of 2,145 shares that were deemed null and void and repaid to certain holders on October 28, 2020), at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 327,273 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $130,896 (net proceeds of $113,000 after taking into consideration issuance costs), which was used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

On October 31, 2020, the Company issued 389 shares of Series H Preferred Stock to James Heckman at the stated value of $1,000, convertible into 1,178,788 shares of the Company's common stock, at the option of the holder subject to certain limitations at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share. The shares of Series H Preferred Stock were issued in connection with the cancellation of promissory notes payable to Mr. Heckman in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $389,000.

The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each Series H Preferred Stock votes on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to beneficial ownership blocker provisions and other certain conditions. In addition, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any common stock equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of common stock (the "Purchase Rights"), then a holder of the Series H Preferred Stock will be entitled to acquire the aggregate Purchase Rights which the holder could have acquired if the holder had held the number of shares of common stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such holder's Series H Preferred Stock immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, subject to certain conditions, adjustments, and limitations. All the shares of Series H Preferred Stock automatically convert into shares of the Company's common stock on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date at the conversion price of $0.33 per share.

The shares of Series H Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of the Company's common stock until the date that increased the number of authorized shares of its common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock to be converted in full, which was filed on December 18, 2020, therefore this limitation was removed (as further described in Note 21).

## F-46

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into on August 10, 2018, in connection with the securities purchase agreements, the Company agreed to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock for resale by the holders. The Company committed to file the registration statement by no later than 75 days after the closing date and to cause the registration statement to become effective, in general, by no later than 120 days after the closing date (or, in the event of a full review by the staff of the SEC, 150 days following the closing date). The registration rights agreement provides for a cash payment equal to 1.0% per month of the amount invested as partial liquidated damages, on each monthly anniversary, payable within 7 days of such event, and upon the occurrence of certain events up to a maximum amount of 6.0% of the aggregate amount invested, subject to interest at 12.0% per annum, accruing daily, until paid in full. The registration rights agreements provide for Registration Rights Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The securities purchase agreements entered into on August 10, 2018, included a provision that requires the Company to maintain its periodic filings with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act. If the Company fails for any reason to satisfy the current public information requirement after 6 months of the closing date, then the Company will be obligated to pay to each holder a cash payment equal to 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested for each 30-day period, or pro rata portion thereof, as partial liquidated damages per month, up to a maximum of 6 months, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full. The securities purchase agreements provide for Public Information Failure Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a deemed dividend with an offset to additional paid-in capital.

Each Series I Preferred Stock votes on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.

## F-47

In consideration for its services as placement agent, the Company paid B. Riley FBR a cash fee of $1,386,000 plus $73,858 in reimbursement of legal fees and other transaction costs. The Company used approximately $18.3 million of the net proceeds from the financing to partially repay the amended and restated 12% Amended Senior Secured Note dated June 14, 2019, and to pay deferred fees of approximately $3.4 million related to that borrowing facility.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the securities purchase agreements on June 28, 2019, the Company agreed to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock for resale by the investors. The Company committed to file the registration statement no later than the 30th calendar day following the date the Company files (i) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) all its required quarterly reports on Form 10-Q since the quarter ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2019, and (iii) current Form 8-K in connection with the acquisitions of TheStreet and its license with ABG, with the SEC, but in no event later than December 1, 2019. The Company committed to cause the registration statement to become effective by no later than 90 days after December 1, 2019, subject to certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events up to a maximum amount of 6% of the aggregate amount invested. The registration rights agreements provide for Registration Rights Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The securities purchase agreements included a provision that requires the Company to maintain its periodic filings with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act. If the Company fails for any reason to satisfy the current public information requirement after 6 months of the closing date, then the Company will be obligated to pay to each holder a cash payment equal to 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested for each 30-day period, or pro rata portion thereof, as partial liquidated damages per month, up to a maximum of 6 months, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full. The securities purchase agreements provide for Public Information Failure Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The Company recognized a portion of the Liquidated Damages pursuant to the registration rights and securities purchase agreements in connection with the Series I Preferred Stock at the time of issuance as it was deemed probable the obligations would not be satisfied when the financing was completed (further details are presented in the table below).

The following table represents the components of the Series I Preferred Stock for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

In consideration for its services as placement agent, the Company paid B. Riley FBR a cash fee of $525,240 plus $43,043 in reimbursement of legal fees and other transaction costs. The Company used $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the financing to partially repay the amended and restated 12% Senior Secured Note dated June 14, 2019, and to use net proceeds of approximately $14.4 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the securities purchase agreements on October 7, 2019, the Company agreed to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series J Preferred Stock for resale by the investors. The Company committed to file the registration statement no later than the 30th calendar day following the date the Company files (i) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) all its required quarterly reports on Form 10-Q since the quarter ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2019, and (iii) current Form 8-K in connection with the acquisition of TheStreet, and other acquisitions during 2018, and its license with ABG, with the SEC, but in no event later than March 31, 2020. The Company committed to cause the registration statement to become effective by no later than 90 days after March 31, 2020, subject to certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events up to a maximum amount of 6% of the aggregate amount invested. The registration rights agreements provide for Registration Rights Damages (further details are provided in

On September 4, 2020, the Company closed on securities purchase agreements with two accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued an aggregate of 10,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 15,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,000,000, which was used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the securities purchase agreements on September 4, 2020, the Company agreed to register the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series J Preferred Stock for resale by the investors. The Company committed to file the registration statement by no later than the 30th calendar day following the date the Company files its (a) Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, (b) all its required Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q since the quarter ended September 30, 2018, through the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and (c) any Form 8-K Reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC; but in no event later than April 30, 2021 (the "Filing Date"). The Company also committed to cause the registration statement to become effective by no later than 60 days after the Filing Date (or, in the event of a full review by the staff of the SEC, 120 days following the Filing Date) and upon the occurrence of certain events up to a maximum amount of 6% of the aggregate amount invested. The registration rights agreements provide for Registration Rights Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series J Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock votes on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.

The securities purchase agreements included a provision that requires the Company to maintain its periodic filings with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act. If the Company fails for any reason to satisfy the current public information requirement after 6 months of the closing date, then the Company will be obligated to pay to each holder a cash payment equal to 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested for each 30-day period, or pro rata portion thereof, as partial liquidated damages per month, up to a maximum of 6 months, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full. The securities purchase agreements provide for Public Information Failure Damages (further details are provided in Note 15).

## F-49

All of the shares of Series K Preferred Stock converted automatically into shares of the Company's common stock on December 18, 2020, as a result of the increase in the number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock (as further described in Note 21). Upon conversion the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature for the underlying common shares since the nondetachable conversion feature was in-the-money (the conversion price of $0.40 was lower than the Company's common stock trading price of $0.61 at the conversion date). The beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a deemed dividend with an offset to additional paid-in capital.

## 21. Stockholders' Equity

## Common Stock

The Company has the authority to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share as the result of filing on December 18, 2020, a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of the State of Delaware to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares.

## Common Stock to be Issued

During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, in connection with the merger of Say Media, the Company issued 2,857,357 shares and 1,188,880 shares, respectively, of its common stock out of total shares required to be issued of 5,067,167 as of January 1, 2019, and has remaining shares to be issued of 1,020,930 as of December 31, 2020.

In connection with a closing of a private placement on January 4, 2018, MDB, as the placement agent, was entitled to receive 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock that have not been issued as of December 31, 2020. Further, the 60,000 shares of common stock to be issued were subject to Liquidated Damages (see Note 15).

## Restricted Stock Awards

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a net of 12,312,417 restricted stock awards for shares of the Company's common stock issued during 2016 remain outstanding and are fully vested. The awards contained a buy-back right that was waived by the Board on March 12, 2018, which resulted in a modification of the restricted stock awards upon the waiver. The shares vest over a three-year period starting on the beginning of the month of the issuance date, with one-third vesting in one year, and the balance monthly over the remaining two years. Because these shares require continued service to the Company, the estimated fair value of the shares is being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.

In connection with the merger of HubPages, the Company issued a total of 2,399,997 shares of common stock to certain key personnel of HubPages who agreed to continue their employment, as restricted stock awards, subject to a repurchase right and vesting. The repurchase right, which expired in March 2019 unexercised, gave the Company the option to repurchase a certain number of shares at par value based on a performance condition as defined in the terms of the merger agreement. The shares were subject to vesting over twenty-four equal monthly installments beginning September 23, 2019, and ending September 23, 2021, with the estimated fair value of these shares was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The restricted stock awards provided for a true-up period that if the common stock was sold for less than $2.50 the holder would receive, subject to certain conditions, additional shares of common stock up to a maximum of the number of shares originally received (or 2,400,000 in aggregate to all holders) for the shares that re-sold for less than $2.50. The true-up provision was settled on May 31, 2019 (as further described in Note 22). The true-up period, in general, was 13 months after the consummation of the merger until 90 days following completion of vesting, or July 30, 2021. The restricted stock awards were fair valued upon issuance by an independent appraisal firm.

On January 1, 2019, the Company issued 833,333 shares of its common stock as restricted stock awards to certain members of the Board subject to continued service with the Company. The awards vest over a twelve-month period from the grant date and the estimated fair value of these shares is being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award (see Note 22).

On December 11, 2019, the Company modified the vesting provisions of 2,000,000 restricted stock awards, issued in connection with the Say Media merger, to remove certain repurchase rights, such that they will vest six equal installments at four-month intervals on the twelfth of each month, starting on December 12, 2019, with the final vesting date on August 12, 2021. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards.

On January 1, 2020, the Company issued 562,500 shares of its common stock as restricted stock awards to certain members of the Board subject to continued service with the Company. The awards vest over a twelve-month period from the grant date and the estimated fair value of these shares is being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award (see Note 22).

Unless otherwise stated, the fair value of a restricted stock award is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock on the date issued.

A summary of the restricted stock award activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

2016 Plan - On December 19, 2016, the Board adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan").

The 2016 Plan allows the Company to grant statutory and non-statutory common stock options, and restricted stock awards (collectively the "common stock awards") to acquire shares of the Company's common stock to the Company's employees, directors and consultants. Shares subject to an award that lapse, expire, are forfeited or for any reason are terminated unexercised or unvested will automatically again become available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Stock awards issued under the 2016 Plan may have a term of up to ten years and may have variable vesting provisions consisting of time-based and performance-based.

On March 28, 2018, the Board approved an increase in the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for grant pursuant to the 2016 Plan from 3,000,000 shares to 5,000,000 shares. On August 23, 2018, the Board increased the authorized number of shares of common stock under the 2016 Plan from 5,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares. The Company's stockholders approved the increase in the number of shares authorized under the 2016 Plan on April 3, 2020. The issuance of common stock awards under the 2016 Plan is administered by the Company and approved by the Board.

The estimated fair value of the common stock awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.

The fair value of common stock awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the Probability Weighted Scenarios utilizing the following assumptions:

|                         | Up-list   | No Up-list   |
|-------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Risk-free interest rate | 0.45 %    | 0.45 %       |
| Expected dividend yield | 0.00 %    | 0.00 %       |
| Expected volatility     | 71.00 %   | 132.00 %     |

## Common Equity Awards

2019 Plan - On April 4, 2019, the Board adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"). The purpose of the 2019 Plan is to retain the services of our directors, employees, and consultants and align the interests of these individuals with the interests of our stockholders through awards of stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, and stock appreciation rights (collectively the "common equity awards"). Certain common equity awards require the achievement of certain price targets of the Company's common stock. Shares subject to a common equity award that lapse, expire, are forfeited or for any reason are terminated unexercised or unvested will automatically again become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Common stock options issued under the 2019 Plan may have a term of up to ten years and may have variable vesting provisions consisting of time-based, performance-based, or market-based.

The Company's stockholders approved the 2019 Plan and the maximum number of shares authorized of 85,000,000 under the 2019 Plan on April 3, 2020 (further details subsequent to the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements are provided under the heading 2019 Equity Incentive Plan in Note 27). The issuance of common equity awards under the 2019 Plan is administered by the Company and approved by the Board. Prior to December 18, 2020, the Company did not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to allow for the exercise of these common equity awards granted; accordingly, any common equity awards granted were considered unfunded and were not exercisable until sufficient common shares were authorized (further details are provided in Note 21).

The estimated fair value of the common equity awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.

The fair value of common equity awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the time-based and performance-based awards by an independent appraisal firm under the Probability Weighted Scenarios utilizing the following assumptions:

## Publisher Partner Warrants

On December 19, 2016, as amended on August 23, 2017, and August 23, 2018, the Board approved the Channel Partner Warrant Program to be administered by management that authorized the Company to grant Publisher Partner Warrants. As of December 31, 2020, Publisher Partner Warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for grant.

The Publisher Partner Warrants had certain performance conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the Publisher Partner Warrants, the Company would notify the respective Publisher Partner of the number of shares earned, with one-third of the earned shares vesting on the notice date, one-third of the earned shares vesting on the first anniversary of the notice date, and the remaining one-third of the earned shares vesting on the second anniversary of the notice date. The Publisher Partner Warrants had a term of five years from issuance and could also be exercised on a cashless basis. Performance conditions are generally based on the average of number of unique visitors on the channel operation by the Publisher Partner generated during the six-month period from the launch of the Publisher Partner's operations on the Company's technology platform or the revenue generated during the period from the issuance date through a specified end date.

## Restricted Stock Units

On May 31, 2019, the Company issued 2,399,997 restricted stock units to certain employees in settlement of the true-up provisions of the restricted stock awards issued

at the time of the HubPages merger. Each restricted stock unit represented the right to receive a number of the shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to a grant agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, and was to be credited to a separate account maintained by the Company in certain circumstances. All amounts credited to the separate account will be part of the general assets of the Company. The restricted stock units were to vest in accordance with the grant agreement in six equal installments at four-month intervals on the first of each month, starting on June 1, 2019, with the final vesting date on February 1, 2021. In addition to the vesting schedule as aforementioned, the restricted stock units would not vest until the Company increased its authorized shares of the Company's common stock. Each restricted stock unit granted and credited to the separate account for the employee will be issued by the Company upon the authorized shares of the Company's common stock increased (further details are provided in Note 21). Further, unless otherwise specified in an employee's grant agreement, vesting will cease upon the termination of the employees continuous service.

The fair value of a restricted stock award is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock on the date issued during the year ended December 31, 2019.

The CARES Act, was enacted March 27, 2020. Among the business provisions, the CARES Act provided for various payroll tax incentives, changes to net operating loss carryback and carryforward rules, business interest expense limitation increases, and bonus depreciation on qualified improvement property. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed on December 27, 2020 which provided additional COVID-19 relief provisions for businesses. The Company has evaluated the impact of both the Acts and has determined that any impact is not material to its financial statements.

The Company must make judgements as to the realization of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. To the extent that the Company believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which the Company does not believe meet the "more likely than not" criteria. The Company's judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If the Company's assumptions and consequently its estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances it has established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. Based upon the Company's historical operating losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance primarily against its deferred tax assets up to the deferred tax liabilities, except for deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangible assets, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards available of approximately $131.17 million, $100.61 million, and $31.15 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. Net operating losses for U.S. federal tax purposes of $60.67 million do not expire (limited to 80% of taxable income in a given year) and $70.50 million will expire, if not utilized, through 2037 in various amounts. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards available of approximately $75.00 million, $59.66 million, and $22.66 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income.

Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation's net operating losses, as well as certain recognized built-in losses and other carryforwards, after an ownership change occurs. A section 382 ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of the Company's common stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Future issuances or sales of the Company's common stock (including certain transactions involving the Company's common stock that are outside of the Company's control) could also result in an ownership change under section 382. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-change net operating losses and other losses the Company can use to reduce its taxable income generally equal to the product of the total value of the Company's outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) and the long-term tax exempt interest rate for the month of the ownership change.

F-66

The Company believes that it did have a change in control under these sections in connection with its recapitalization on November 4, 2016 and utilization of the carryforwards would be limited such that the majority of the carryforwards will never be available. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded those net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards in its deferred tax assets. The Company completed a preliminary section 382 analysis as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 and concluded it may have experienced an ownership change as a result of certain equity offerings during the rolling three-year period of 2018 to 2020. The Company concluded that its federal net operating loss carryforwards, including any net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the mergers during 2018 and 2019, resulted in annual limitations on the overall net operating loss carryforward and that the ownership change during 2018, 2019 and 2020 would impose an annual limit on the net operating loss carryforwards and could cause federal income taxes (similar provisions apply for state and local income taxes) to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. The federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards are stated net of any such anticipated limitations as of December 31, 2020.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes on the statement of operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to loss before the benefit for income taxes, as follows:

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next 12 months.

The Company did not recognize any uncertain tax positions or any accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
