## Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

Certain statements and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and include, without limitation, statements concerning our business strategy, future revenues, market growth, capital requirements, product introductions, the timing, outcome or financial impacts of the planned Business Combination (as defined below) and related transactions, and expansion plans and the adequacy of our funding. Other statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are also forwardlooking statements. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and other comparable terminology.

Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for example, statements about:

- ● our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in the future;
- ● our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting;
- ● our ability to attract new subscribers and to persuade existing subscribers to renew their subscriptions;
- ● the success of strategic relationships with third parties;
- ● our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel;
- ● our ability to manage our growth effectively, including through strategic acquisitions;
- ● our ability to attract, develop, and retain capable Publisher Partners (as described below) and expert contributors;
- ● our ability to attract new advertisers and to persuade existing advertisers to continue to advertise on the Platform (as described below);
- ● our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter;
- ● our ability to respond to general economic conditions;
- ● the impact of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic;
- ● our ability to continue to satisfy NYSE American listing rules;
- ● our estimates of the sufficiency of our existing capital resources combined with future anticipated cash flows to finance our operating requirements; and
- ● other factors detailed under the section entitled " Risk Factors ."

We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or that we may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on the beliefs of, assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Such statements are based on assumptions, and the actual outcome will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance, and some will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, our actual future results can be expected to differ from our expectations, and those differences may be material. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based only on known results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.

Certain risks are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and also from time to time in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC" or "Commission").

This Annual Report on Form 10-K and all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Part I

## Item 1. Business

The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. (the "Company," "Arena Group," "we," "our," or "us"), is a media company that leverages technology to build deep content verticals powered by anchor brands and a best-in-class digital media platform (the "Platform") empowering publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. Our strategy is to focus on key subject matter verticals where audiences are passionate about a topic category (e.g., sports and finance) where we can leverage the strength of our core brands to grow our audience and increase monetization both within our core brands as well as for our media publisher partners (each, a "Publisher Partner"). Our focus is on leveraging our Platform and brands in targeted verticals to maximize audience reach, enhance engagement, and optimize monetization of digital publishing assets for the benefit of our users, our advertiser clients, and our greater than 40 owned and operated properties as well as properties we run on behalf of independent Publisher Partners. We own and operate TheStreet, The Spun, Parade, and Men's Journal and power more than 320 independent Publisher Partners, including the many sports team sites that comprise FanNation.

Each Publisher Partner joins the Platform by invitation only with the objective of improving our position in key verticals while optimizing the performance of the Publisher Partner. Publisher Partners incur the costs in content creation on their respective channels and receive a share of the revenue associated with their content. Because of the state-of-the-art technology and large scale of the Platform and our expertise in search engine optimization, social media, ad monetization and subscription marketing, Publisher Partners continually benefit from our ongoing technological advances and audience development expertise. Additionally, we believe the lead brands within our verticals, create a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content.

## The Platform

We developed the Platform, a proprietary online publishing platform that provides our owned and operated media businesses, Publisher Partners (who are third parties producing and publishing content on their own domains), and individual creators contributing content to our owned and operated sites ("Expert Contributors"), the ability to produce and manage editorially focused content through tools and services provided by us. We have also developed proprietary advertising technology, techniques and relationships that allow us, our Publisher Partners, and our Expert Contributors to monetize editorially focused online content through various display and video advertisements and tools and services for driving a subscription or membership based business and other monetization services (the "Monetization Solutions" and, together with the Platform, the "Platform Services"). Our Platform offers audiences bespoke content with optimized design and page construction.

The Platform comprises state-of-the-art publishing tools, video platforms, social distribution channels, newsletter technology, machine learning content recommendations, notifications, and other technology that deliver a complete set of features to drive a digital media business in an entirely cloud-based suite of services. Our software engineering and product development teams are experienced at delivering these services at scale. We continue to develop the Platform software by combining proprietary code with components from the open-source community, plus select commercial services as well as identifying, acquiring, and integrating other platform technologies where we see unique long-term benefits to us.

## The Platform Services include:

- ● Content management, machine learning driven content recommendations, traffic redistribution, hosting and bandwidth;
- ● Video publishing, hosting, and player solution via an integrated set of third party providers;
- ● Dashboards for our Publisher Partners as well as integration with leading analytics services like Google Analytics;
- ● User account management;
- ● User account migration to our Platform, including emails and membership data;
- ● Technical support team to support our Publisher Partners and staff (if applicable) on the Platform;
- ● Advertising serving, trafficking/insertion orders, yield management, reporting and collection;

4

- ● Various integrations to enable the syndication of content (e.g., Apple News, Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, Google news and RSS feeds); and
- ● Other features, as they may be added to the Platform from time to time.

Our Publisher Partners use the Platform Services to produce, manage, host and monetize their content in accordance with the terms and conditions of partner agreements between each of our Publisher Partners and us (the "Partner Agreements"). Our Publisher Partners incur the costs with respect to creating their content; thus, not requiring capital investment by us. Pursuant to the Partner Agreements, we and our Publisher Partners split revenue generated from the Platform Services used in connection with the Publisher Partner's content based on certain criteria. Criteria include whether the revenue was from direct or programmatic advertising sales, was generated by our Publisher Partner or us, was generated in connection with a subscription or a membership, was generated from syndicating or third party licensing, or whether the revenue was derived from affiliate links.

Subject to the terms and conditions of each Partner Agreement and in exchange for the Platform Services, our Publisher Partners grant us, for so long as our Publisher Partner's assets are hosted on the Platform, (i) the right to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, publicly display, distribute, transmit, modify, adapt and create derivative works of the content provided by the Publisher Partner to provide, maintain and improve the Platform Services; (ii) use, publicly display, distribute and transmit the name, logo, and trademarks of the Publisher Partner to identify them as users of the Platform Services; (iii) exclusive control of ads.txt with respect to our Publisher Partner's domains; and (iv) the exclusive right to include our Publisher Partner's website domains and related URLs in a consolidated listing assembled by third party measurement companies such as comScore, Nielsen or other similar measuring services selected by us. As such, the Platform serves as the primary digital media and social platform with respect to each of our Publisher Partners' website domains during the applicable term of each Partner Agreement.

## Our Brands and Growth Strategy

Our business model is to grow our Platform audience while striving to diversify revenue and drive gross margin through traditional media brands as well as new digitalfirst brands. We believe our vertical model allows us and our Publisher Partners to leverage audience growth, technological efficiencies and cost savings across all of our brands. Our vertical model consists of (i) acquiring or partnering with powerful brands that can offer our audience custom content and domain authority, (ii) forming key strategic partnerships with like-minded partners of high-quality content, (iii) partnering with entrepreneurial publishers to drive local content at variable cost tied to performance, and (iv) growing our Publisher Partners on our network to expand our content offerings and add scale to the ecosystem.

Our growth strategy is to continue adding new Publisher Partners in key verticals that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on the Platform. In each vertical, we seek to build around leading brands, such as FanNation, Athlon Sports or The Spun (for sports), TheStreet (for finance) and Parade and Men's Journal (for lifestyle), surround them with subcategory specialists, and further enhance coverage with individual Expert Contributors. The primary means of expansion is adding independent Publisher Partners or acquiring publishers that have premium branded content and can broaden the reach and impact of the Platform. Specifically, our growth initiatives include: (i) increasing syndication of the content on our Platform through the re-publishing the content on third party websites, (ii) offering of podcasts and e-commerce through our Platform, (iii) acquiring or developing new verticals for our users, and (iv) continuing to identify and partner with new Publisher Partners.

## Sports Vertical

In 2019, we launched our sports vertical by entering into a Licensing Agreement (as described below) with Authentic Brands Group ("ABG"), pursuant to which we were granted the exclusive right and license in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand to operate the Sports Illustrated print and digital media business under the Sports Illustrated brand. While continuing to evolve and expand the sports business and leverage the Sports Illustrated brand, in October 2020 we launched FanNation, a curated collection of independent sports journalists, each focused on a single professional or leading collegiate sports team. FanNation and other sports Publisher Partners helped to more than triple pageviews in our sports vertical from 2020 to 2023. In 2023 our sports Publisher Partners represented more than double the traffic of Sports Illustrated internet domains. Also driving the expansion in the sports vertical was the addition of The Spun and Athlon Sports.

5

The Spun founded in September 2012, and acquired by us in June 2021, is an online independent sports publication that brings readers the most interesting athletic stories of the day. The Spun focuses on the social media aspect of the industry. Athlon Sports was acquired by us as part of the Parade acquisition in April 2022. It had been a print-only property publishing newsstand magazines covering the various drafts and both professional and collegiate sports. We leveraged its expertise and appeal on-line as part of our sports vertical and today it is a significant part of our digital sports presence.

As further described in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with our failure to make a quarterly payment due ABG pursuant to the Licensing Agreement for the Sports Illustrated media business, of approximately $3,750,000, on January 18, 2024, ABG notified the Company of its intention to terminate our Licensing Agreement, effective immediately, for the Sports Illustrated media business, dated June 14, 2019, by and between us and ABG (as amended to date, the "Licensing Agreement"). Upon such termination, a fee of $45.0 million became immediately due and payable by us to ABG pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreement. In addition, upon termination of the Licensing Agreement, all outstanding and unvested warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued to ABG in connection with the Licensing Agreement became immediately vested and exercisable. On March 18, 2024, ABG announced it had reached an agreement in principle with a third party that will become the new operator of the Sports Illustrated media business. We are engaging in continuing discussions with ABG and the third party regarding the timing and terms of the transition of the Sports Illustrated component of the business to the aforementioned third party. We will continue to operate our sports vertical led by FanNation, The Spun, Athlon Sports, and the other sports Publisher Partners.

## TheStreet

TheStreet is a leading financial news and information provider to investors and institutions worldwide and produces business news and market analysis for individual investors. TheStreet has a strong editorial tradition, a subscription platform, and valuable membership base to us, and benefits from our mobile-friendly Content Management System, social, video, and monetization technology.

## Parade

We acquired Parade, a premium-branded company in April 2022 which helped to expand our digital audience reach. Parade has become the anchor of our new lifestyle vertical, and Athlon Sports, one of Parade's premium-brands, has expanded our sports vertical. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we discontinued the Parade print business, including the print operations of Parade, and the Relish and Spry Living print products that were acquired as part of the Parade acquisition. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

## Men's Journal

We acquired the digital assets of Men's Journal from Weider Publications, a subsidiary of A360 Media, LLC in December 2022 to supplement our growing lifestyle vertical. This suite of digital assets provides our audience with access to premium active lifestyle brands including Men's Journal, Men's Fitness, Surfer, Powder, Bike, SKATEboarding, Snowboarder and NewSchoolers.

## HubPages

HubPages enhances the user's experience by including content from individual creators to the HubPages network of premium content channels that are owned and operated by Arena. These channels, such as PetHelpful, dengarden and Fashionista, act as an open community for writers, explorers, knowledge seekers, and conversation starters to connect in an interactive and informative online space.

## Corporate History

We were originally incorporated in Delaware as Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. ("Integrated") in 1990. On October 11, 2016, Integrated and TheMaven Network, Inc. ("Maven Network") entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), whereby the stockholders of Maven Network agreed to exchange all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Maven Network for shares of common stock of Integrated. On November 4, 2016, the parties consummated a re-capitalization pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and, as a result, Maven Network became a wholly owned subsidiary of Integrated. Integrated changed its name to theMaven, Inc. on December 2, 2016.

On September 20, 2021, we re-branded to "The Arena Group." Effective on February 8, 2022, we changed our legal name to The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. in conjunction with filing a Certificate of Amendment and Certificate of Corrections with the State of Delaware. On February 9, 2022, our common stock began trading on the NYSE American under the trading symbol "AREN".

## Intellectual Property

We use proprietary technology to operate our business, and our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.

As of December 31, 2023, we had seven issued patents in the United States, all expiring by 2033.

As of December 31, 2023, we also owned approximately 1,300 U.S. copyright registrations and had unregistered copyrights in our software documentation, software code, marketing materials, and website content that we developed, and owned over 1,600 registered domain names. As of December 31, 2023, we also owned approximately 160 U.S. trademark registrations, 29 pending U.S. trademark applications, and 89 issued foreign trademark registrations and 16 pending foreign trademark applications in over 30 countries, and a number of unregistered marks that we use in the United States and other countries to promote our brands.

Our registered trademarks are all subject to maintenance or renewal at various times through 2033.

We will continue to file updated trademark applications in the United States and abroad to reflect our branding evolution and to continue strengthening our trademark portfolio as financial resources permit. From time to time, we also expect to file additional patents and copyrights.

## Our Publisher Partners and Licensing

In connection with our Partner Agreements and any other applicable agreements between us and our Publisher Partners, (i) we and our affiliates own and retain (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Platform, other Monetization Solutions and data collected by us, and (b) we and our licensors' trademarks and branding and all software and technology we use to provide and operate the Platform and Monetization Solutions, and (ii) each Publisher Partner owns and retains (a) all right, title, and interest in and to the Publisher Partner's assets, content, and data collected by Publisher Partner and (b) each Publisher Partner's trademarks and branding.

## Human Capital Resources

Our total number of employees as of December 31, 2023 was 448, of which 441 were full-time employees and seven were part-time employees. As of December 31, 2023 approximately 18% of our workforce, or 82 employees, is represented by a union named The NewsGuild of New York, CWA Local 31003 (the "Guild") pursuant to a binding Memorandum of Agreement executed by and between the Guild and The Arena Media Brands, LLC ("Arena Media") on December 31, 2021 (the "MOA"), which covers Sports Illustrated editorial staff. The MOA addresses the terms of employment for covered employees and non-employees regarding, among other things, wages, raises, bonuses, severances, benefits, discipline and the like. We incorporated the terms of the MOA into our fiscal 2023 employment practices.

7

In January 2024, we announced a reduction to our workforce of approximately one-third of our employees in order to reduce costs and achieve profitability. This included all 82 employees represented by the Guild.

## Corporate Culture

We like to say that The Arena Group is where the action is - where passion drives each of us. The things we love are what keep us coming back to read, watch and experience the best in sports, finance, and entertainment - brought to you by the iconic brands you admire most. We are building out the pathways to passion - your ticket to continuous excitement.

We are working to build and sustain a company culture that enables our employees to show up as their best, whole selves; to communicate, collaborate, and innovate with their colleagues, no matter where they are located; and to learn, grow, and belong.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

We believe that a workforce rich in diversity of thought, background, and experience helps us build a company and community where we can all succeed. In December 2022, we launched our first company-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") Council - comprised of 18 employees with a variety of identities and backgrounds that also represented as wide a selection as possible across brands, functions, and tenures at Arena, and most importantly, represented a clear commitment to diversity and inclusion at our company. In 2023, the Council met monthly to share employee experiences, identify opportunities to improve our culture, and advise senior leadership on how to direct an annual DEI budget. As a result of feedback from the Council, a sample of outcomes include attendance at multiple conferences led by diverse journalism organizations, hosted panels internally ranging from celebration of identities to supporting mental health, and the creation of the framework for our

2024 monthly DEI learning and discovery series.

## Seasonality

We experience seasonality as a result of advertising seasonality, sports seasons and major sporting events. Advertising typically peaks in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as advertisers tend to concentrate their budgets during the holiday season. This trend is magnified by professional sports and college football seasons, which account for a significant portion of our advertising revenue during that period of the year. Other sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the Winter and Summer Olympics, soccer's World Cup, and major golf, tennis and cycling events create increased traffic at the time of these respective events.

## Competition

Currently, we believe that there are many competitors delivering media content in the verticals that we serve on the web and on mobile devices and an even broader array of general media companies and major media brands that compete for the attention of users overall and the advertisers who desire to reach them. We have developed a playbook that leverages our Platform to optimize the performance of both our owned and operated and our Publisher Partners' properties. The playbook is a set of processes, procedures and tactics that help improve the consumer experience, develop a greater organic audience reach, apply data management and artificial intelligence tools, optimize monetization and leverage content through syndication and improve distribution. The iconic brands leading each of our verticals, such as Athlon Sports, FanNation, The Spun, TheStreet and Men's Journal, leverage this playbook to deliver a highly engaging and effective experience for our users, advertisers and subscribers.

The Internet allows theoretically unlimited market access for niche or general media companies resulting in a large number and variety of participants competing directly for audiences, ad spend and membership revenues. The general business of online media, combined with some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that will compete with us in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their markets more quickly and penetrate those markets more effectively. The following is a list of possible competitors and their respective categories:

- ● Vice, Buzzfeed, Business Insider, et al., producers of niche content, leveraging social media, mobile, and video to compete for ad dollars;
- ● Fortune, CNN, ESPN, Yahoo!, Google, et al., major media companies and producers of general content which compete for ad dollars;
- ● WordPress, Medium, RebelMouse, Arc, content management software providers, open to all including experts and professionals, which compete for publishers;
- ● Leaf Group Ltd. And Future PLC, which compete for partners and ad dollars;
- ● YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, social media platforms open to all creators and which also compete for ad dollars; and
- ● Affiliate networks such as Liberty Alliance, which compete for ad dollars.

In addition, we view Nexstar Media Group, Inc. and Ziff Davis as peer companies for purposes of performance comparisons even though we do not consider them direct competitors.

We believe that our technology, our substantial scale in traffic, the ease of use of our Platform, our well-known lead media brands, and the continuing development and evolution of our Platform and an acquisition program provides us with a basis to compete effectively for market share in terms of ad spend and membership revenue.

## Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to many United States federal and state laws and regulations that involve data privacy, data protection, rights of publicity, content regulation, intellectual property, or other subjects. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain and the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty.

Several government authorities, both in the United States and abroad are increasing their focus on privacy issues and the use of personal information. All U.S. states have enacted some form of data security legislation and there are several federal laws governing data privacy. A growing number of U.S. states have enacted laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA"), which was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA") which went into effect January 1, 2020. As more states consider or enact laws about information security, companies may be required to adopt written information security policies consistent with state laws.

At the U.S. federal the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and state attorneys general have oversight of business operations concerning the use of personal information and breaches of the privacy laws and may examine privacy policies to ensure that a company discloses all material practices and fully complies with representations in the policies regarding the use of personal information and the failure to do so could give rise to penalties under state or federal unfair competition or consumer protection laws.

We review our privacy policies and overall operations on a regular basis to ensure compliance with applicable United States federal and state laws, and to the extent applicable, any foreign laws. We launched a CCPA compliance program in January 2020, and have expedited it to cover CPRA as well. On an annual basis we review the program and adjust our privacy notice and compliance program practices to account for our evolving practices and the CCPA/CPRA regulations, which were first promulgated in July 2020 and continue to be subject to ongoing rulemaking. There are conflicting interpretations of adopted law in the digital media industry, and given the lack of guidance to date on many of these issues, our compliance posture on some issues might not be accepted by the State of California.

9

In addition to the laws of the United States, we may be subject to foreign laws regulating web sites and online services that in some jurisdictions are stricter than the laws in the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union ("EU"). Some EU countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing additional data protection requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. The GDPR also includes certain requirements regarding notification of data processing obligations or security incidents to appropriate data protection authorities. How the GDPR will be fully applied to online services, including cookies and digital advertising, is still being determined through ongoing rulemaking and evolving interpretation by applicable authorities. On June 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU"), declared the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield framework ("Privacy Shield") to be invalid. As a result, Privacy Shield is no longer a valid mechanism for transferring personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. We are addressing this issue, for instance, by including standard contractual clauses as part of our Data Processing Agreements; however, it is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses will also be invalidated by the European courts or legislature. GDPR also convers a private right of action to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities to seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages for violations of the GDPR. GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of our consolidated annual worldwide gross revenue).

Social networking websites are also under increasing scrutiny. Legislation has been introduced on the state and federal level that could regulate social networking websites. Any such regulation would likely be an impediment to our business.

The FTC regularly considers issues relating to online behavioral advertising (a/k/a interest-based advertising), which is a significant revenue source for us, and Congress and state legislatures are frequently asked to regulate this type of advertising, including requiring consumers to provide express consent for tracking purposes, so that

advertisers may know their interests and are, therefore, able to serve them more relevant, targeted ads. Targeted ads generate higher per impression fees than nontargeted ads. New laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could potentially place restrictions on our ability to utilize our database and other marketing data (e.g., from third parties) on our own behalf and on behalf of our advertising clients, which may adversely affect our business.

Legislation concerning the above-described online activities could affect our ability to make our websites available in certain countries as future legislation is made effective. It is possible that state and foreign governments might also attempt to regulate our transmissions of content on our website or prosecute us for violations of their laws. United States law offers limited safe harbors and immunities to publishers for certain liability arising out of user-posted content, but other countries do not. Further, legislative proposals in the United States and internationally could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties and liability for defamation or other claims arising out of user-posted content. Our business could be negatively impacted if applicable laws subject us to greater regulation or risk of liability.

Our business could also be adversely affected if regulatory enforcement authorities, such as the California Attorney General or EU/EEA data protection authorities, take issue with any of our approaches to compliance, or if new laws, regulations or decisions regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use or disclosure of personal information are implemented in such ways that impose new or additional technological requirements on us, limit our ability to collect, transmit, store and use or disclose the information, or if government authorities or private parties challenge our data privacy or security practices that result in liability to, or restrictions on us, or we experience a significant data or information breach which would require public disclosure under existing notification laws and for which we may be liable for damages or penalties.

Furthermore, governments of applicable jurisdictions might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities even though we do not have a physical presence or operate in those jurisdictions. As our platforms, products and advertising activities are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of those jurisdictions and pay various taxes in those jurisdictions. We address state and local jurisdictions where we believe we have nexus, however, there can be no assurance that we have complied with all jurisdictions that may assert that we owe taxes.

Currently, we carry cybersecurity and business interruption coverage to mitigate certain potential losses, but this insurance is limited in amount and may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to a cybersecurity breach and related business and system disruptions. We cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed our policy limits, insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. In addition, we may be subject to changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Listed below is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. There are numerous factors that affect our business, operations and financial results, many of which are beyond our control. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer. As a result, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." All dollar figures are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated.

## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with the Platform, our business would be seriously harmed.

The success of our business and our ability to attract and retain advertisers heavily depends on the size of our user base and the level of engagement of our users. Several factors could negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:

- ● our users increasingly engage with competing platforms instead of the Platform;
- ● we fail to introduce new and exciting products and services, or such products and services do not achieve a high level of market acceptance;
- ● we fail to accurately anticipate user needs, or we fail to innovate and develop new software and products that meet these needs;
- ● we fail to price our products competitively;
- ● we do not provide a compelling user experience because of the decisions we make regarding the type and frequency of advertisements that we display;
- ● we are unable to combat spam, bugs, malwares, viruses, hacking, or other hostile or inappropriate usage of our products or the Platform (as defined below);
- ● there are changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products in the short-term, long-term, or both;
- ● there are increased user concerns related to privacy and information sharing, safety, or security on the Platform;
- ● there are adverse changes in our products or services that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or legal proceedings;
- ● technical or other problems frustrate the user experience, particularly if those problems prevent us from delivering our products in a fast and reliable manner;
- ● we, our Publisher Partners, or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, some of which may be inaccurate or include confidential information that we are unable to correct or retract; or
- ● we fail to maintain our brand image or our reputation is damaged.

Our license agreement to operate the Sports Illustrated media business was terminated by the licensor, which may materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

In connection with our failure to make a quarterly payment due to ABG pursuant to the Licensing Agreement of approximately $3,750,000, on January 18, 2024, ABG notified us of the termination of the Licensing Agreement, effective immediately, in accordance with its rights under the Licensing Agreement. Upon such termination, a fee of $45.0 million became immediately due and payable by us to ABG pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Licensing Agreement. In addition, upon termination

of the Licensing Agreement, all outstanding and unvested warrants to purchase shares of Arena common stock issued to ABG in connection with the Licensing Agreement became immediately vested and exercisable.

On March 18, 2024, ABG announced it had reached an agreement in principle with a third party to become the new operator of the Sports Illustrated media business. We are engaging in discussions with ABG and the third party regarding the timing and terms of the transition of the Sports Illustrated media business to the aforementioned third party.

The loss of the rights to operate the Sports Illustrated media business, in addition to termination payments that are due following termination of the Licensing Agreement, could harm our competitiveness in our industry, damage any goodwill we may have generated, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any subsequent rebranding efforts we may undertake may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.

## We defaulted on certain covenants included in our debt agreements that could result in the acceleration of the related debt or the exercise of other remedies.

On December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest payment due pursuant to the Third A&R NPA (as defined in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Secured Notes") in the amount of approximately $2.8 million, resulting in an event of default under the Arena Notes (as described below) (the "Arena Notes Default"). On January 5, 2024, we entered into a forbearance agreement (the "Forbearance Agreement") with Renew Group Private Limited ("Renew"), the lender under the Third A&R NPA, pursuant to which Renew agreed to a forbearance period through March 29, 2024, while reserving its rights and remedies. The forbearance period is subject to us retaining a chief restructuring officer acceptable to Renew. Also on January 5, 2024, the Company's board of directors finalized an engagement with FTI Consulting Inc. ("FTI"), a global business advisory firm, to assist the Company with its turnaround plans and forge an expedited path to sustainable positive cash flow and earnings to create shareholder value (the "FTI Engagement"). As part of the FTI Engagement, Jason Frankl, a senior managing director of FTI, was appointed as the Company's Chief Business Transformation Officer. Jason Frankl is a chief restructuring officer acceptable to Renew. On March 27, 2024, the forbearance period was extended through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024 ; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing. The outstanding principal on the Arena Notes was approximately $110.7 million as of December 31, 2023.

The Arena Notes Default, as well as the Company's failure to make a quarterly payment due to ABG pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, resulted in an Event of Default under its credit and security agreement dated February 2020 (as amended, the "Arena Credit Agreement") with SLR Digital Finance LLC ("SLR"). On March 13, 2024 the Company entered into a loan agreement (the "Arena Loan Agreement"), by and between the Company and Simplify Inventions, LLC ("Simplify" and in reference to the loan agreement, the "Simplify Loan"), which provides for up to $25 million of borrowings to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Upon the closing, the Company borrowed approximately $7.7 million, of which approximately $3.4 million was used to repay the outstanding loan balance, accrued interest, certain fees and contingency reserves under its Arena Credit Agreement. The indirect owner of Renew also has an indirect non-controlling interest in Simplify.

Borrowings under the Arena Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. Upon the termination of the forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement, Renew can declare all outstanding borrowings under the Arena Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Simplify could declare all outstanding borrowings under the Arena Loan Agreement together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and, subject to the terms of the intercreditor agreement between Renew and Simplify, foreclose on our assets. Any of these actions would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations and could lead to selling assets, cutting costs, reducing cash requirements, filing bankruptcy or ceasing operations.

12

## The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.

The digital media industry is fragmented and highly competitive. There are many players in the digital media market, many with greater name recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. The general business of online media, combined with some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that will compete with us in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their markets more quickly and penetrate those markets more effectively. We expect competition to intensify in the future. All of this could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.

## The sales and payment cycle for online advertising is long, and such sales may not occur when anticipated or at all, all of which could adversely affect our business.

The decision process is typically lengthy for brand advertisers and sponsors to commit to online campaigns and subject to delays which may be beyond our control. In addition, some advertisers and sponsors take months after the campaign runs to pay, and some may not pay at all, or require partial "make-goods" based on performance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

## We are dependent on the continued services and on the performance of key third party content contributors, the loss of which could adversely affect our business.

We rely on content contributed by third party providers to attract users that drive advertising and subscription revenue. The loss of the services of any of such key contributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Competition for such contributors is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate, or retain them which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

## Our revenues could decrease if the Platform does not continue to operate as intended.

The Platform performs complex functions and is vulnerable to undetected errors or unforeseen defects that could result in a failure to operate or inefficiency. The occurrence of errors and defects could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of market share, increased development costs, diversion of development resources and injury to our reputation or damage to our efforts to expand brand awareness.

## The growing percentage of users whose computers, tablets, or phones do not support identification through third party cookies, mobile identifiers, or other tracking technologies could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.

We rely heavily on our ability to collect and disclose data and metrics in order to attract new advertisers and retain existing advertisers. Any restriction, whether by law, regulation, policy, or other reason, on our ability to collect and disclose data that our advertisers find useful would impede our ability to attract and retain advertisers.

We use "cookies," or small text files placed on user devices when an Internet browser is used, as well as mobile device identifiers, to connect users' computers anonymously to information that we gather, enabling the Platform to demonstrate to advertisers its efficacy. More and more devices have offered functionalities that block such anonymized identifiers and some prominent technology companies have announced intentions to discontinue the use of cookies entirely. Although we believe the Platform is well-positioned to continue to provide key data insights to advertisers without cookies, actions by advertisers to buy advertising based on alternative identifiers could lead to changes in purchase behavior of such advertisers, thereby possibly impacting our operations, and our financial condition could be adversely affected.

## Our Publisher Partners may engage in intentional or negligent misconduct or other improper activities on the Platform or otherwise misuse the Platform, which may damage our brand image, our business and our results of operations.

The Platform provides our owned and operated media businesses, Publisher Partners, and individual creators contributing content the ability to produce and manage editorially focused content through tools and services provided by us. We might not be able to monitor or edit a significant portion of the content, such as advertising content, that appears on the Platform. If misconduct and misuse of the Platform for inappropriate or illegal purposes occurs, user experience on the Platform may suffer, and claims may be brought against us. Our business and public perception of our brands may be materially and adversely affected if we face any related lawsuits or other liabilities.

## The Platform and our technology systems contain open-source software, which may pose particular risk to our proprietary software, features and functionalities in a manner that negatively affect our business.

We use open-source software in the Platform and our technology systems and will continue to use open-source software in the future. We have set up an internal system to monitor the open-source software we use in our operation and its functionality, and to manage the risk it poses to our business. We may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open-source software or derivative works that we developed using such software. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This could require significant additional technology and development resources, and we may not be able to complete such re-engineering successfully.

## ECONOMIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

## We may have difficulty managing our growth.

We have added, and expect to continue to add, Publisher Partner and end-user support capabilities, continue software development activities, and expand our administrative capabilities. In the past two years, we have entered into multiple strategic transactions which have significantly expanded our business and placed significant strain on our resources. To manage any further growth, we will be required to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems and properly manage our employee base. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.

## The strategic relationships that we may be able to develop and on which we may come to rely may not be successful.

We will seek to develop strategic relationships with advertising, media, technology, and other companies to enhance our market penetration, business development, and advertising sales revenues. There can be no assurance that these relationships will develop and mature, or that potential competitors will not develop more substantial relationships with the same or more attractive partners. Our inability to successfully implement our strategy of building valuable strategic relationships could harm our business.

## A significant portion of our revenues is derived from a single customer. If we were to lose this customer, our revenues could decrease significantly.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 10% of our revenue was derived from sales to a single customer. The loss of this customer, or a significant reduction in sales to such customer, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

## Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our growth will depend in part on the ability of our users, customers, and Publisher Partners to access the Platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. We may experience performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing the Platform software simultaneously, denial of service attacks, or other security related incidents. If the Platform software is unavailable or if our users are unable to access it within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business would be negatively affected.

14

Moreover, the Partner Agreements with our Publisher Partners include service level standards that obligate us to provide credits or termination rights in the event of a significant disruption of the Platform, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.

## We operate our exclusive coalition of professional-managed online media channels on third party cloud platforms and data center hosting facilities.

We rely on software and services licensed from, and cloud platforms provided by, third parties to offer our digital media services. Any errors or defects in third party software or cloud platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our digital media services, which could harm our reputation, our business and force us to seek more expensive alternatives. Failure of these third party systems could cause us to render credits or pay penalties or cause our Publisher Partners to terminate their contractual arrangements with us.

We are subject to certain standard terms and conditions with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, companies which have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and those changes may be unfavorable to us.

## Real or perceived errors, failures, or "bugs" in the Platform could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.

Because the Platform is complex, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may occur despite prior testing, especially when updates are deployed. Real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our software could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of the Platform, loss of competitive position, or claims by our Publisher Partners or our users for losses sustained by them.

## Malware, viruses, hacking attacks, and improper or illegal use of the Platform could harm our business and results of operations.

Malware, viruses, and hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and have occurred on our systems and may occur in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware, or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

## If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could suffer.

Our success significantly depends on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technology. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we fail to receive adequate protection of our proprietary rights.

We could be required to cease certain activities or incur substantial costs due to claims of infringement of another party's intellectual property rights.

Some of our competitors and other third parties may own technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and website content which they may use to assert claims against us. We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to claims that we have misappropriated or misused other parties' intellectual property rights. Any claim or litigation alleging that we have infringed or otherwise violated intellectual property or other rights of third parties, with or without merit, whether or not settled out of court or determined in our favor, could be time-consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.

15

If we are required to make substantial payments, cease using the challenged intellectual property, obtain a license or redesign existing technology due to any intellectual property infringement claims against us, such payments or actions could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.

## We are subject to many laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that are constantly evolving and involve matters central to our business.

We are subject or will be subject in the future to myriad constantly evolving laws, statutes and regulations in the United States as well as in other countries where we may do business. These include, among others, privacy, data protection, and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, employee classification, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services, and the related compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and cause significant penalties to be imposed on us.

In particular, the growth and development of Internet content, commerce and communities may prompt more stringent consumer protection, privacy, and data protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, as well as new laws governing their taxation. Compliance with any newly adopted laws may prove difficult and costly for us.

Our services involve the storage and transmission of digital information; therefore, cybersecurity incidents, including those caused by unintentional errors and those intentionally caused by third parties, may expose us to a risk of loss, unauthorized disclosure or other misuse of this information, litigation liability, regulatory exposure, reputational harm and increased security costs.

We and our third party service providers experience attempted cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, one of which infiltrated our systems and accessed a limited amount of our non-financial and encrypted data. We expect to incur significant, increasing costs in ongoing efforts to detect and prevent cybersecurity-related incidents. We cannot ensure that our efforts to prevent cyber security incidents will succeed. While we purchase liability coverage for certain of these types of matters, a significant cybersecurity incident could subject us to reputational harm, loss of revenue, financial liability and other damage that may exceed our insurance coverage and preclude us from obtaining adequate insurance levels in the future.

## Existing or future strategic alliances, long-term investments and acquisitions may have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.

We may enter strategic business relationships with third parties to further our business purpose from time to time. These alliances could subject us to risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association.

Future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own will require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business operations. Acquisitions may not achieve our goals and could be viewed negatively by users, business partners or investors, use substantial amounts of cash, cause potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, require significant goodwill impairment charges or amortization expenses for other intangible assets and expose us to unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. In addition to, in some cases, having to obtain shareholders' approval, we may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from relevant authorities for the acquisitions, which could result in increased delay and costs.

16

## Our products may require availability of components or known technology from third parties and their non-availability can impede our growth.

We license/buy certain technology integral to our products from third parties, including open-source and commercially available software. Our inability to acquire and maintain any third party product licenses or integrate the related third party products into our products in compliance with license arrangements, could result in delays in product development until equivalent products can be identified, licensed and integrated. We also expect to require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves. We cannot provide assurance that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

## Our business is subject to the risk of catastrophic events such as pandemics, earthquakes, flooding, fire, and power outages, and to interruption by man-made acts, such as war and terrorism.

Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from pandemics, earthquakes, flooding, fire, power outages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, and similar events. A significant natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Furthermore, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our Publisher Partners' businesses or the U.S. economy as a whole. Our technology infrastructure may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays and loss of critical data. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances. As we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality user and customer service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our Publisher Partners' businesses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Compliance with the reporting obligations under the United States securities laws and Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires expenditure of capital and other resources and may divert management's attention. If we fail to comply with these reporting obligations or to maintain adequate internal controls our operations, and investors' confidence in us, could be materially and adversely affected.

As a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the preparation of annual reports, quarterly reports, and current reports. Complying with these rules and regulations have caused us and will continue to cause us to incur additional legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly. Further, by complying with public disclosure requirements, our business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in increased threatened or actual litigation.

In preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

were remediated in 2023 with the implementation of additional controls and procedures. However, we may in the future discover material weaknesses in other areas of our internal control over financial reporting that require remediation.

Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, cause us to lose investor confidence, prevent us from obtaining capital on favorable terms or at all, and subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NYSE American or other regulatory authorities.

If we fail to timely meet our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley and other applicable securities rules and regulations in their entirety, we could be subject to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the NYSE American and face lawsuits, and we will not be able to obtain independent accountant certifications required for public companies under Sarbanes-Oxley.

## Unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations.

Our services, products, properties, and our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable or at all may be adversely impacted by uncertain economic conditions, including but not limited to, regional conflicts, pandemics, adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax laws or tax rates, inflation, economic downturns, recessions, contraction in the availability of credit, and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions.

17

Our ongoing cash management strategy is to maintain diversity in our deposit accounts across financial institutions to manage risks from potential instability in the banking system, but deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful.

We cannot predict how future economic conditions will affect our users and Publisher Partners and any negative impact on our users or Publisher Partners may also have an adverse impact on our own results of operations or financial condition.

## RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND INTERNAL CONTROL

As the general economic and market conditions present uncertainty as to our ability to secure additional capital, there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue to conduct operations.

Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of the Platform, our offerings, competing technological developments, and general economic and market conditions, which have presented substantial uncertainty in recent months. We may need to raise funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, any equity financing will be dilutive to existing stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility with respect to certain business matters. Strategic arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights or grant licenses to some or substantial parts of our intellectual property. If funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share, and such equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of our existing capital stock. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue operating, develop or enhance products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

## We have a history of losses.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net loss of approximately $193.8 million compared to approximately $135.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $373.1 million. In fiscal 2023, we had net loss of approximately $55.6 million compared to approximately $70.9 million in fiscal 2022. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $378.7 million. We may continue to incur losses in the future if we do not achieve sufficient revenue or adequately reduce costs to achieve and maintain profitability. There is no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient cash flows to support our continued operations in the future without needing to seek additional capital funding or borrowings. We can provide no assurance that if we need to seek such additional outside capital that it will be available on favorable terms or at all. Any failure to achieve and maintain profitability could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, our results and operations, and our financial condition.

Our financial conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a "going concern" through one year from the date of the financial statements contained herein if the Business Combination is not consummated and we are unable to refinance or modify the terms of the Third A&R NPA and the underlying debt with Renew.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, Arena incurred a net loss of $55.6 million. For year ended December 31, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, our cash on hand of $9.3 million and $13.9 million and a working capital deficit of $63.3 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Arena's net loss and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due.

18

As a result, management determined there is substantial doubt about Arena's ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless (i) Arena closes the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement by and among the Company, Simplify, Bridge Media Networks, LLC ("Bridge Media"), New Arena Holdco, Inc ("New Arena") and the other parties dated November 5, 2023, as amended on December 1, 2023 (the "Business Combination") and (ii) Arena is able to refinance or modify the terms of the Third A&R NPA and the underlying debt with Renew, which is subject to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024, (b) the closing of the Business Combination, and (c) the termination of the Business Combination, and establishes debt payments that are serviceable by the Company's cash flow. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that financing sources will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or if at all, that our plans to consummate the Business Combination will be successful or the Company will be able to refinance or modify the terms of the Third A&R NPA and the underlying debt with Renew. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

## Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors.

We operate in an evolving industry, and as a result, our business has evolved over time such that our operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and future results of operations are likely to fluctuate as well. Although we have experienced substantial revenue growth, we may not be able to sustain this growth rate or current revenue levels or achieve profitability. In addition, because our business is evolving, our historical results of operations may be of limited utility in assessing our future prospects. We expect to face challenges, risks, and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing industries, including those relating to:

- ● changes in demand and pricing for our products, services and the Platform;
- ● developing, maintaining, and expanding relationships with Publisher Partners and advertisers;
- ● innovating and developing new solutions that are adopted by and meet the needs of Publisher Partners and advertisers;
- ● competing against companies with a larger user and customer base or greater financial or technical resources;
- ● changes in the pricing policies of Publisher Partners, advertisers and competitors;
- ● changes in our access to valuable user data;
- ● costs to develop and upgrade the Platform to incorporate new technologies;
- ● costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs;
- ● seasonality in our business;
- ● the length and complexity of our sales cycles;
- ● the timing of stock-based compensation expense;
- ● potential costs to attract, onboard, retain and motivate qualified personnel;
- ● responding to evolving industry standards and government regulations that impact our business, particularly in the areas of data protection and consumer privacy;
- ● changes in demand as a result of changes in the macroeconomic environment, as a result of inflation, changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates, or otherwise; and
- ● further expanding our business in other markets.

Any one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. You should not rely on our past results as an indicator of our future performance.

Because many of our expenses are based upon forecast demand and may be difficult to reduce in the short term, volatility in quarterly revenue could cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations. We may not forecast our revenue or expenses accurately, which may cause our results of operations to diverge from our estimates or the expectations of securities analysts, and investors. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and we could face costly litigation, including securities class action lawsuits.

19

## Any future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.

We have in the past and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims or regulatory inquiries or proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers and partners in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims for reimbursement following misappropriation of customer data.

For example, we could face claims relating to information published or made available on the Platform. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, intellectual property rights and rights of publicity and privacy. We might not be able to monitor or edit a significant portion of the content that appears on the Platform. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third party actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. If any of these events occur, our business could be seriously harmed.

Our employees are highly experienced, having worked in our industry for many years and prior employers may try to assert that our employees are breaching restrictive covenants and other limitations imposed by past employment arrangements. We believe that all of our employees are free to work for us in their various capacities and have not breached past employment arrangements. Notwithstanding our care in our employment practices, a prior employer may assert a claim against us. Such claims can be costly to contest, disruptive to our work environment, and may be detrimental to our operations and financial results.

Moreover, insurance may not cover any such claims that rise in the ordinary course of business, may not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our results of operations and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our common stock. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

## Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.

As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses of $193.8 million, and certain NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to make use of our NOLs. Subject to certain limitations, NOLs can be used to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit certain NOLs we may use in any year for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our Company. If an "ownership change" occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on certain preownership NOLs and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused. In addition, our ability to use our net operating losses is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income, and certain net operating losses could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to make use of our net operating losses.

## RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNANCE AND COMMON STOCK

We are dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our key executive officers, management team, and other key personnel, the loss of which could adversely affect our business.

We are dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our key executive officers, management team, and other key personnel. We also depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, operational, business development, and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, assimilate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers, members of our management team, or other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

20

The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers, and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights for our obligations to our directors, officers, and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees.

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our "Certificate of Incorporation"), and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (our "Bylaws") contain provisions permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for damages for the breach of a fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Delaware law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any future employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and the resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even through such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.

Because we are a "smaller reporting company," we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.

Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we will be a "smaller reporting company," as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations, including with respect to executive compensation, in our periodic reports, proxy statements, and registration statements. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the prior June 30. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.

Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage a takeover attempt even if a takeover might be beneficial to our stockholders and limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers and employees.

Provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to affect certain corporate actions. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of unissued series of our Preferred Stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our Board can authorize and issue shares of our Preferred Stock with voting or conversion rights that could dilute the voting power of holders of other series of our capital stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of us. Additionally, our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws establish limitations on the removal of directors and include advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.

In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation, or our Bylaws; any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

21

Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), which prohibits an "interested stockholder" owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such stockholder acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.

## Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.

Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, Section 145 of the DGCL or our Certificate of Incorporation provides that:

- ● We indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful.
- ● We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.
- ● We are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a legal proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
- ● The rights conferred in our Certificate of Incorporation are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees, and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.
- ● We may not retroactively amend our Certificate of Incorporation or indemnification agreement, if any, to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents.

## The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.

Stocks of companies in the media and technology industries have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to do so. These fluctuations could cause you to incur substantial losses, including all of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operational or financial performance, include, among others, the following:

- ● price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
- ● announcements of new products, solutions or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors;
- ● the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;
- ● fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float, including in connection with an acquisition;
- ● sales of large blocks of our common stock;
- ● actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations or financial projections;
- ● failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
- ● recruitment or departures of key personnel;
- ● governmental or regulatory developments or actions, or litigation involving us, our industry, or both
- ● general economic conditions and trends, including inflation and fluctuating interest rates;

22

- ● general political conditions and trends, political instability and acts of war or terrorism, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as in the Middle East;
- ● public health crises and related measures to protect the public health (such as the COVID-19 pandemic);
- ● major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;
- ● changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles; and
- ● "flash crashes," "freeze flashes," or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed.

In addition, if the market for stock of media and technology companies or the stock market, in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in the media and technology industries even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If litigation is instituted against us, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and adversely affect our business.

## Our Board is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock that would dilute existing stockholders and sales, distribution or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

Our Board has the authority to issue any or all authorized but unissued shares of our common stock at any price and, with regard to our preferred stock, at any price and with any attributes our Board considers appropriate, absent stockholder approval. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current stockholders and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Moreover, the sale or distribution of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, particularly sales by us or our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur in large quantities, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, shares subject to outstanding warrants as well as the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plans, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will become eligible for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. Further, we also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock, from time to time in connection with financing, an acquisition, investments, or otherwise. Any of the aforementioned activity, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of common stock to decline.

## We may issue additional securities with rights superior to those of our common stock, which could materially limit the ownership rights of our stockholders.

We may offer additional debt or equity securities in private or public offerings in order to raise working capital or to refinance our debt. Our Board has the right to determine the terms and rights of any debt securities and preferred stock without obtaining the approval of our stockholders. It is possible that any debt securities or preferred stock that we sell would have terms and rights superior to those of our common stock and may be convertible into shares of our common stock. Any sale of securities could adversely affect the interests or voting rights of the holders of our common stock, result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders, or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

## Cyber-attacks and other security threats and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

As a tech-powered media company, we face cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, and attacks on technical infrastructure. Our customers and suppliers face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations.

23

The sophistication of threats continues to evolve and grow, including the risk associated with the use of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, for nefarious purposes. In addition to cybersecurity threats, we face threats to the security of our systems and employees from terrorist acts, sabotage or other disruptions, any of which could adversely affect our business. The improper conduct of our employees or others working on behalf of us who have access to confidential or sensitive information could also adversely affect our business and reputation. Our customers (including sites that we operate for our customers) and suppliers experience similar security threats.

If we are unable to protect sensitive information, including complying with evolving information security, data protection and privacy regulations, our customers or governmental authorities could investigate the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures; and could bring actions against us for noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Moreover, depending on the severity of an incident, our customers' data, our employees' data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how), and other third party data (such as suppliers) could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business. Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships with our customers and financial results.

Given the persistence, sophistication, volume and novelty of threats we face, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating an attack that could have a material adverse effect on us and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.

Our suppliers face similar security threats and an incident at one of these entities could adversely impact our business. These entities are typically outside our control and may have access to our information with varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards and capabilities. Adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain. Breaches in our supply chain could in the future compromise our data and adversely affect customer deliverables. We also must rely on our supply chain for adequately detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or in a timely manner. Failures by our suppliers could result in damages to you and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.

## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Not Applicable.

## Item 1C. Cybersecurity

As a tech-powered media company, we face cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, and attacks on technical infrastructure. Our customers and suppliers face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations.

We maintain a cyber risk management program designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. This program addresses cybersecurity risks to the corporate information technology ("IT") environment including systems, hardware, software, data, people, and processes.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees management's processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity risks. Our VP of Information Security regularly briefs senior leadership on our cybersecurity and information security posture including on the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and senior leadership will then brief the Audit Committee. In the event of an incident, we intend to follow our incident response playbook, which outlines our planned response from incident detection to mitigation, recovery and notification, including notifying functional areas (e.g. legal), as well as senior leadership and the Board, as appropriate.

Our security team is responsible for our overall information security strategy, including policy, security engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response. Our security team has extensive experience selecting, deploying, and overseeing cybersecurity technologies, initiatives, and processes. Employees outside of our security team also have a role in our cybersecurity defenses, and they are given training which we believe improves our cybersecurity.

Third parties also play a role in our cybersecurity risk management strategy. We engage third parties to conduct risk assessments and evaluations of our security controls. Such risk assessment and evaluations identify, quantify, and categorize any cyber risks. In addition, we, along with third party cyber risk management specialists, develops a risk mitigation plan to address such risks, and where necessary, remediate potential vulnerabilities identified through the assessment and evaluation process. Third party cybersecurity risk management engagement also includes activities such as penetration testing, independent audits or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. We include security and privacy addendums to our contracts where applicable. We have also commenced third party risk management assessments to help manage the risks associated with reliance on vendors, critical service providers, and other third-parties that may lead to a service disruption or an adverse cybersecurity incident.

Our VP of Information Security and cybersecurity stakeholders regularly brief the senior leadership team on cyber vulnerabilities identified through the risk management process, the effectiveness of our cyber risk management program, the emerging threat landscape, and new cyber risks on at least an annual basis. This includes updates on our processes to prevent, detect, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.

Notwithstanding the approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured. We have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy, regulatory compliance, results of operations, or financial condition. The Company proactively seeks to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against Company IT assets, data, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to internal processes and tools and changes or updates to Company service delivery; however, potential vulnerabilities to known or unknown threats will still remain. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.

## Item 2. Properties

As of December 31, 2023, we had two leases in California. In Santa Monica, California we have a leased space which we sublet that terminates in November 2024. In Carlsbad, California we have a lease for office space that is partially sublet. We do not occupy the balance of the space. The Carlsbad lease terminates in March 2025. As we operate our business principally in a virtual environment, these two leased spaces are not utilized in our operations. To the extent we need to lease physical properties in the future, we believe we would be able to find suitable properties at market rates.

## Item 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we may be subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Note 27, Commitments and Contingencies to our accompanying consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 30, 2024, our former President of Media filed an action against us and Manoj Bhargava, alleging claims for breach of contract, failure to pay wages and defamation, among other things, in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and seeking damages in an unspecified amount. We believe that we have strong defenses to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves and the allegations made in this lawsuit.

On March 21, 2024, our former CEO and Chairman of the Board filed an action against us, members of the Board of directors and Simplify, alleging claims for retaliation, breach of contract, wrongful termination and age discrimination, among other things, in the Superior Court of the State of California seeking damages in an amount of $20 million. We believe that we have strong defenses to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves and the allegations made in this lawsuit.

## Key Operating Metrics

Our key operating metrics are:

- ● Revenue per page view ("RPM") - represents the advertising revenue earned per 1,000 pageviews. It is calculated as our advertising revenue during a period divided by our total page views during that period and multiplied by $1,000; and
- ● Monthly average pageviews - represents the total number of pageviews in a given month or the average of each month's pageviews in a fiscal quarter or year, which is calculated as the total number of page views recorded in a quarter or year divided by three months or 12 months, respectively.

We monitor and review our key operating metrics as we believe that these metrics are relevant for our industry and specifically to us and to understanding our business. Moreover, they form the basis for trends informing certain predictions related to our financial condition. Our key operating metrics focus primarily on our digital advertising revenue, which has experienced significant growth in recent periods as indicated in the Results of Operations section below. Management monitors and reviews these metrics because such metrics are readily measurable in real time and can provide valuable insight into the performance of and trends related to our digital advertising revenue and our overall business. We consider only those key operating metrics described here to be material to our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

For pricing indicators, we focus on RPM as it is the pricing metric most closely aligned with monthly average pageviews. RPM is an indicator of yield and pricing driven by both advertising density and demand from our advertisers.

Monthly average pageviews are measured across all properties hosted on the Platform and provide us with insight into volume, engagement and effective page management and are therefore our primary measure of traffic. We utilize a third party source, Google Analytics, to confirm this traffic data.

As described above, these key operating metrics are critical for management as they provide insights into our digital advertising revenue generation and overall business performance. This information also provides feedback on the content on our website and its ability to attract and engage users, which allows us to make strategic business decisions designed to drive more users to read or view more of our content and generate higher advertising revenue across all properties hosted on the Platform.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 our RPM was $23.95 and $18.17, respectively. The 32% increase in RPM reflects a significant increase in video advertising as a percentage of total digital advertising as digital video advertising is sold at a significantly higher price than digital display advertising. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 our monthly average pageviews were 464,261,595 and 489,659,595, respectively. The 5% decrease in monthly average pageviews reflects algorithmic changes at Google, Facebook and other platforms which subdued user click-throughs to the original content.

## Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions

Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to our business. Increases in inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the responses thereto, and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of our business, the ultimate extent of the impact on our business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of our control and could exist for an extended period of time. As a result, we are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties. For more information regarding these risks and uncertainties, see the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Working Capital Facility

As of December 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of $9,284 and accounts receivable, net of our advances under the Arena Credit Agreement of $25,202. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Arena Credit Agreement was $19,609. On March 13, 2024 the Arena Credit Agreement was refinanced with the Simplify Loan. As of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements our cash balance is $4,151 and the balance outstanding under the Simplify Loan is $7,748, with the additional availability of $17,252.

Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had revenues of $244,203 during fiscal 2023 and have experienced recurring net losses from operations and negative operating cash flows. Consequently, we were dependent upon continued access to funding and capital resources from both new investors and related parties. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our growth plan and plan of operations. These financings may include terms that may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.

We continue to be focused on growing our existing operations and seeking accretive and complementary strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We believe, that with additional sources of liquidity and the ability to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement our internal projections, we will be able to execute our growth plan and finance our working capital requirements both in the short-term and long-term.

## Going Concern

Management performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. We are required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

Most recently, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $55,582, had cash on hand of $9,284 and a working capital deficit of $145,622. Our net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those

conditions or events would limit our ability to meet our obligations when due. Also, since our 2023 Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes (as further described below) (collectively "our current debt") are subject to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024, (b) the closing of the Business Combination, and (c) the termination of the Business Combination (see Note 28, Subsequent Events , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), unless we are able to refinance or modify the terms of our current debt we run the risk that our debt could be called, therefore, we may not be able to meet our obligations when due.

In our evaluation, management determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless we are able to refinance or modify our current debt.

We plan to refinance or modify the maturities of our current debt and complete the Business Combination to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or modify our current debt and complete the Business Combination.

Debt Financings and Obligations

Net proceeds from our debt financings consisted of the following:

Arena Credit Agreement. We were party to a financing and security agreement with SLR (the "Arena Credit Agreement"), as amended on December 15, 2022 and August 31, 2023, pursuant to which SLR extended a $40,000 line of credit for working capital purposes secured by a first lien on all our cash and accounts receivable and a second lien on all other assets. Borrowings under the facility bore interest at the prime rate plus 4% per annum of the amount advanced and had a maturity date of December 31, 2025. The aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of December 31, 2023 was $19,609. On March 13, 2024, the Arena Credit Agreement was refinanced by the Simplify Loan, which bears interest at 10% per annum of the amount advanced and has a maturity date of March 13, 2026.

2023 Notes. Pursuant to the Third A&R NPA (as defined below), on August 31, 2023, we issued $5,000 aggregate principal amount of notes with additional borrowings of $1,000 on September 29, 2023 and $2,000 on November 23, 2023 (the "2023 Notes"). On December 1, 2023, Renew, an affiliated entity of Simplify, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers and as purchaser, purchased the 2023 Notes from BRF Finance Co., LLC ("BRF Finance"), an affiliated entity of B. Riley Financial, Inc. ("B. Riley"). Borrowings under the 2023 Notes bore interest at 10% per annum. On December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest paymentdue on the 2023 Notes resulting in an event of default with subsequent agreement to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (further details are provided under the heading Arena Loan Agreement in Note 28, Subsequent Events in our accompanying consolidated financial statements). The balance outstanding under our 2023 Notes as of December 31, 2023 was $8,000.

Bridge Notes. Pursuant to the Third A&R NPA (as defined below), on December 15, 2022, we issued $36,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the "Bridge Notes"). On December 1, 2023, Renew, an affiliated entity of Simplify, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers and as purchaser, purchased the Bridge Notes from BRF Finance. We received net proceeds of $34,728, after the payment of $1,000 to B. Riley for an advisory fee and $272 for other legal costs, from the issuance of the Bridge Notes. Interest on the Bridge Notes was payable in cash at a rate of 10% per annum as amended on August 31, 2023, from 12% per annum quarterly, with an increase in the interest rate by 1.5% per annum on March 1, 2023, May 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023. On December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest payment due on the Bridge Notes resulting in an event of default with subsequent agreement to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024 ; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (further details are provided under the heading Arena Loan Agreement in Note 28, Subsequent Events in our accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Bridge Notes are subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements, including, but not limited to, a requirement that we apply the net proceeds from certain debt incurrences or equity offerings to repay the Bridge Notes. We may elect to prepay the Bridge Notes, at any time, at our option at 100% of the principal amount. The Bridge Notes are secured by liens on the same collateral that secures indebtedness under our outstanding Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and are guaranteed by our subsidiaries that guarantee the Third A&R NPA. The Note Purchase Agreement contains covenants and events of default substantially similar to those contained in the note purchase agreement that governed the Third A&R NPA. The proceeds received were used for the acquisition of Men's Journal and to repay $5,928 of our existing Delayed Draw Term Notes (as defined below). The balance outstanding under our Bridge Notes as of December 31, 2023 was $36,000.

Senior Secured Notes. We are party to a third amended and restated note purchase agreement (the "Third A&R NPA"), with Renew, an affiliated entity ofSimplify, where we issued senior secured notes (the "Senior Secured Notes"). On December 1, 2023, Renew purchased the Senior Secured Notes from BRF Finance. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Interest payments are payable at Renew's discretion either in cash quarterly in arrears on the last day of each quarter or by adding the interest to the outstanding principal amount. On December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest payment due on the Senior Secured Notes resulting in an event of default with subsequent agreement to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024 ; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (further details are provided under the heading Arena Loan Agreement in Note 28, Subsequent Events in our accompanying consolidated financial statements). The balance outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes as of December 31, 2023 was $62,691, which included outstanding principal of $48,791 and payment of in-kind interest of $13,900 that we were permitted to add to the aggregate outstanding principal balance.

Delayed Draw Term Notes. Pursuant to the Third A&R NPA, we agreed to issue delayed draw term notes (the "Delayed Draw Term Notes"). On December 1, 2023, Renew, an affiliated entity of Simplify, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers and as purchaser, purchased the Delayed Draw Term Notes from BRF Finance. The Delayed Draw Term Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Interest payments are payable, at Renew's discretion, either in cash quarterly in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter or in kind in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter. On December 29, 2023, we failed to make the interest payment due on the Delayed Draw Term Notes resulting in an event of default with subsequent agreement to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024 ; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (further details are provided under the heading Arena Loan Agreement in Note 28, Subsequent Events in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

The balance outstanding under the Delayed Draw Term Notes as of December 31, 2023 was $4,000.

29

Acquisition

The purchase price consisted of the following: (1) $500 cash paid at closing; (2) $75 cash payments due in three equal installments of $25 on March 1, 2023 (paid), April 1, 2023 (paid) and May 1, 2023 (paid); (3) $200 deferred cash payment due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to certain indemnity provisions; and (4) the issuance of 274,692 shares of our common stock, subject to certain lock-up provisions, on the closing date with a fair value of $2,000 (fair value was determined based on an independent appraisal); and which is subject to a put option under certain conditions.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

## None.

## Material Contractual Obligations

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business primarily consisting of employment contracts, consulting agreements, leases, liquidated damages, debt and related interest payments. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months.

During 2022, we assumed the lease from Men's Journal for office space in Carlsbad, California, that expires in March 2025, and as of December 31, 2023 we remain responsible for $1,439 over the remaining lease term. The lease provides for fixed payments of $89 for three months, $92 for twelve months and $94 for twelve months, with an estimate of common expenses per month of $25 through the end of the lease term. Pursuant to two subleases entered into during 2023, the sublessees will pay us an aggregate of $312, net of security deposits, through March 2025.

We also subleased our office space in Santa Monica, California in November 2021 and remain responsible to the original lessor for $373 through October 2024. Pursuant to the sublease, the sublessee will pay us an aggregate of $225 through October 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2023 we had gross profit of $101,963, as compared to $88,012 for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $13,951. Gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 41.8%, as compared to 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

This increase is partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $9,317, or 7%, resulting from higher publisher partner revenue share along with increased technology, Platform and software licensing costs.

|                                                  | Years Ended December 31,   | Years Ended December 31,   | 2023 versus 2022   | 2023 versus 2022   |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|                                                  | 2023                       | 2022                       | $ Change           | % Change           |
| Change in fair value of contingent consideration | $ (1,010 )                 | $ -                        | $ (1,010 )         | 100.0 %            |
| Interest expense, net                            | (17,965 )                  | (11,428 )                  | (6,537 )           | 57.2 %             |
| Liquidated damages                               | (583 )                     | (1,140 )                   | 557                | -48.9 %            |
| Total other expenses                             | $ (19,558 )                | $ (12,568 )                | $ (6,990 )         | 55.6 %             |

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration of $1,010 for the year ended December 31, 2023 represents the change in the put option on our common stock in connection with the acquisition of Fexy Studios. As part of that acquisition consideration, we issued 274,692 shares of our common stock, which was subject to a put option under certain conditions (as further described in Note 17, Fair Value Measurement in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense, net of $17,965 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $11,428 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense of $6,537 was primarily from additional interest from our debt.

Liquidated Damages. We recorded liquidated damages of $583 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $1,140 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $557 in liquidated damages recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, is primarily because in 2022 we had an assessment under certain agreements as a result of filing a registration statement outside of the agreed upon filing deadline.

## Income Taxes

Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of $222 primarily related to tax deductible goodwill. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1,063 primarily from our acquired deferred tax liabilities from an acquisition during the year and change in valuation allowance as of year-end that was, in part, offset by certain previous acquisitions related to tax deductible goodwill.

For further details refer to Note 24, Income Taxes , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

## Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"); however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that are noncash in nature or not related to our core business operations. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss as adjusted for loss from discontinued operations, with additional adjustments for (i) interest expense (net), (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) change in valuation of contingent consideration, (vi) liquidated damages, (vii) loss on impairment of assets, (viii) loss on sale of assets; (ix) employee retention credit, (x) employee restructuring payments; and (xi) professional and vendor fees.

Our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations is that Adjusted EBITDA:

- ● does not reflect interest expense and financing fees, or the cash required to service our debt, which reduces cash available to us;

35

- ● does not reflect income tax provision or benefit, which is a noncash income or expense;
- ● does not reflect depreciation and amortization expense and, although this is a noncash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, increasing our cash requirements;
- ● does not reflect stock-based compensation and, therefore, does not include all of our compensation costs;
- ● does not reflect the change in valuation of contingent consideration and, although this is a noncash income or expense, the change in the valuations each reporting period are not impacted by our actual business operations but is instead strongly tied to the change in the market value of our common stock;
- ● does not reflect liquidated damages and, therefore, does not include future cash requirements if we repay the liquidated damages in cash instead of shares of our common stock (which the investor would need to agree to);
- ● does not reflect any losses from the impairment of assets, which is a noncash operating expense;
- ● does not reflect any losses from the sale of assets, which is a noncash operating expense
- ● does not reflect the employee retention credits recorded by us for payroll related tax credits under the CARES Act;
- ● does not reflect payments related to employee severance and employee restructuring changes for our former executives; and
- ● does not reflect the professional and vendor fees incurred by us for services provided by consultants, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors, which services were related to certain types of events that are not reflective of our business operations.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:

- (10) Professional and vendor fees represents fees that are nonrecurring in connection with the Business Combination resulting in a change of control, including fees incurred by consultants, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, platform development, impairment of long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

## Revenue

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers. We account for revenue on a gross basis, as compared to a net basis, in our statement of operations. We have made this determination based on our control of the advertising inventory and the ability to monetize the advertising inventory or publications before transfer to the customer and because we are also the primary obligor responsible for providing the services to the customer. Cost of revenue is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue:

## Advertising Revenue

Digital Advertising. We recognize revenue from digital advertisements at the point when each ad is viewed. The quantity of advertisements, the impression bid prices, and revenue are reported on a real-time basis. We enter into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with our various channels. Although reported advertising transactions are subject to adjustment by the advertising network partners, any such adjustments are known within a few days of month end. We owe our independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the advertising revenue earned, which is recorded as service costs in the same period in which the associated advertising revenue is recognized.

Advertising revenue that is comprised of fees charged for the placement of advertising on the websites that we own and operate, is recognized as the advertising or sponsorship is displayed, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Print Advertising. Advertising related revenues for print advertisements are recognized when advertisements are published (defined as an issue's on-sale date), net of provisions for estimated rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts.

## Subscription Revenue

Digital Subscriptions. We enter into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on our owned and operated media channels and facilitate such contracts between internet users and our Publisher Partners. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription to access the premium content. For subscription revenue generated by our independent Publisher Partners' content, we owe our Publisher Partners a revenue share of the membership subscription revenue earned, which is initially deferred and recorded as deferred contract costs. We recognize deferred contract costs over the membership subscription term in the same pattern that the associated membership subscription revenue is recognized.

Digital subscription revenue generated from our websites that we own and operate are charged to customers' credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers, and are generally billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. We calculate net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges. Net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods. Unearned revenue relates to payments for subscription fees for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided.

## Print Revenue

Print revenue includes magazine subscriptions and single copy sales at newsstands.

Print Subscriptions. Revenue from magazine subscriptions is deferred and recognized proportionately as products are distributed to subscribers.

38

Newsstand. Single copy revenue is recognized on the publication's on-sale date, net of provisions for estimated returns. We base our estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

## Licensing and Syndication Revenue

Content licensing-based revenues and syndication revenues are accrued generally monthly or quarterly based on the specific mechanisms of each contract. Generally, revenues are accrued based on estimated sales and adjusted as actual sales are reported by partners. These adjustments are typically recorded within three months of the initial estimates and have not been material. Any minimum guarantees are typically earned evenly over the fiscal year.

## Contract Modifications

We occasionally enter into amendments to previously executed contracts that constitute contract modifications. We assess each of these contract modifications to determine:

- ● if the additional services and goods are distinct from the services and goods in the original arrangement; and
- ● if the amount of consideration expected for the added services or goods reflects the stand-alone selling price of those services and goods.

A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, or a cumulative catch-up basis.

## Platform Development

For the years presented, substantially all of our technology expenses are development costs for our Platform that were expensed as incurred or capitalized as intangible costs. Technology costs are expensed as incurred or in accordance with applicable guidance that requires costs incurred in the preliminary project and postimplementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized.

We capitalize internal labor costs, including compensation, benefits and payroll taxes, incurred for certain capitalized platform development projects. Our policy with respect to capitalized internal labor stipulates that labor costs for employees working on eligible internal use capital projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of the project when the impact, as compared to expensing such labor costs, is material. Our Platform development capitalized during the application development stage of a project include:

- ● payroll and related expenses for personnel; and
- ● stock-based compensation of related personnel.

39

## Business Combinations

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that the purchase price, including the fair value of contingent consideration, of the acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the estimated fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net fair values of the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. While we use best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent we identified adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, we identify acquisition-related contingent payments and determine their respective fair values as of the acquisition date, which are recorded as accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent payments are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. We expense transaction costs related to the acquisition as incurred.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually on December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We operate as one reporting unit, therefore, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting unit. If the fair value of our reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of our net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of our other assets and liabilities.

## Stock-Based Compensation

We provide stock-based compensation in the form of (a) stock awards to employees and directors, comprised of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, (b) stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, (c) common stock warrants to Publisher Partners (no warrants were issued during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021), and (d) common stock warrants to ABG (all as further described in Note 22, Stock-Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).

We account for stock awards and stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, and non-employee awards to certain directors and consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the stock-based payments as compensation expense our consolidated financial statements. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees and non-employees which are time-vested, are measured at fair value on the grant date, and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees and non-employees which are performance-vested, are measured at fair value on the grant date and charged to operations when the performance condition is satisfied or over the service period.

40

The fair value measurement of equity awards and grants used for stock-based compensation is as follows: (1) restricted stock awards and restricted stock units which are time-vested, are determined using the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date; (2) stock option grants which are time-vested and performance-vested, are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date; (3) restricted stock units and stock option grants which provide for market-based vesting with a time-vesting overlay, are determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date; (4) Publisher Partner Warrants are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model; and (5) ABG warrants are determined utilizing the Monte Carlo model.

Fair value determined under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo model is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the stock award, the exercise price of the stock option or warrant, as compared to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of our common stock over the term of the stock award. Estimated volatility was determined under the (1) "Probability Weighted Scenarios" (prior to our reverse stock split on February 8, 2022) where one scenario assumes that our common stock will be up-listed on a national stock exchange (the "Exchange") on a certain listing date (the "Up-list") where the estimated volatility was based on evaluating the average historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are publicly traded and the second scenario assumes our common stock is not up-listed on the Exchange prior to the final vesting date of the grants (the "No Up-list") where the historical volatility of our common stock was evaluated based upon market comparisons; and the (2) "Up-list Scenario" (after our reverse stock split on February 8, 2022) where our estimated volatility is based on evaluating the average historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are publicly traded after we up-listed to the NYSE American. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of our common stock.

We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur and to recognize stock-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period for awards with graded vesting. We classify stock-based compensation cost on our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's cash compensation cost is classified.

## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.

41

## Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

All information required by this item is listed in the Index to Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report.

## Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

## Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

## Remediation of the Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As reported in Part II, Item 9A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of the material weaknesses described below.

Specifically, in preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified the following control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022: (i) we had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives related to our information technology general controls ("ITGCs"), specifically as it relates to change management; and (ii) there was insufficient validation of nonGoogle impression data provided by certain third party service providers.

These material weaknesses were remedied in fiscal 2023 by (i) implementing new permissions and approval requirements in our change management process in our systems previously identified with inadequate segregation of duties and (ii) obtaining, reviewing, and mapping a System and Organization Controls - SOC 1 Type 2 report from third party service providers for the effectiveness of third party controls relevant to our internal control over financial reporting, including validation of impression data, and implementing compensating management controls to further validate non-Google impressions data provided by certain third party service providers.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Based o n the above evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of Dece mber 31, 2023.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.

42

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as described above under "Remediation of the Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

## Item 9B. Other Information

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

## Explanatory Paragraph - Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and may need to restructure its debt to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matters

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

## THE ARENA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

($ in thousands, unless otherwise stated)

## 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

## Organization

The Arena Holdings Group, Inc. (formerly known as TheMaven, Inc.) ("The Arena Group" or the "Company"), was incorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990. On October 11, 2016, the predecessor entity now known as The Arena Group exchanged its shares with another entity that was incorporated in Delaware on July 22, 2016. On November 4, 2016, these entities consummated a recapitalization. This resulted in The Arena Group becoming the parent entity, and the other Delaware entity becoming the wholly owned subsidiary. On December 19, 2019, the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries The Arena Platform, Inc. (formerly known as Maven Coalition, Inc.), and HubPages, Inc. ("HubPages"), which was acquired by the Company in a merger during 2018, were merged into another of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, Say Media, Inc. ("Say Media"), which was acquired by the Company in a merger during 2018, with Say Media as the surviving corporation. On January 6, 2020, Say Media changed its name to The Arena Platform, Inc. ("Arena Platform"). As of December 31, 2023, the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries consist of The Arena Platform, The Arena Media Brands, LLC ("Arena Media") (formerly known as Maven Media Brands, LLC) formed during 2019 as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Arena Group), TheStreet, Inc. ("TheStreet" acquired by the Company in a merger during 2019), College Spun Media Incorporated ("The Spun" acquired by the Company in a merger during 2021) and Athlon Holdings, Inc. ("Parade" acquired by the Company in a merger during 2022 as further described in Note 4).

The Company changed its legal name to The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. from TheMaven, Inc. on February 8, 2022. The Company's subsidiaries changed their corporate names to The Arena Platform, Inc. from Maven Coalition, Inc. and to The Arena Media Brands, LLC from Maven Media Brands, LLC on February 18, 2022.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, The Arena Group, The Arena Platform, TheStreet, The Spun and Parade, are together hereinafter referred to as the "Company."

## Reverse Stock Split

On February 8, 2022, the Board approved a one-for-twenty-two (1-for-22) reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock that was effective February 8, 2022. The Company's common stock began trading on the NYSE American (the "NYSE American") on February 9, 2022 (as further described below). At the effective time, every twenty-two shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without

any change in the number of authorized shares. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the next whole number.

The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The shares of common stock retained a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, stockholders' deficiency reflects the reverse stock split by reclassifying from "common stock" to "additional paidin capital" in an amount equal to the par value of the decreased shares resulting from the reverse stock split. In connection with the reverse stock split, proportionate adjustments were made to increase the per share exercise prices and decrease the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of common stock options and warrants whereby approximately the same aggregate price is required to be paid for such securities upon exercise as had been payable immediately preceding the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares that would otherwise be issued as a result of the reverse stock split were rounded up to the nearest whole share.

On February 9, 2022, in connection with the Company's legal name change and reverse stock split, the Company up-listed its common stock to the NYSE American, which began trading on February 9, 2022 under the symbol "AREN." The Company's common stock, prior to the up-list, was quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.'s ("OTCM") OTCQX$^{®}$ Best Market (the "OTCQX") under the symbol "MVEN."

## Business Operations

The Company is a media company that leverages technology to build deep content verticals powered by anchor brands and a best-in-class digital media platform (the "Platform") empowering publishers who impact, inform, educate, and entertain. The Company's strategy is to focus on key subject matter verticals where audiences are passionate about a topic category (e.g., sports and finance) where it can leverage the strength of its core brands to grow its audience and increase monetization both within its core brands as well as for its media publisher partners (each, a "Publisher Partner"). The Company's focus is on leveraging its Platform and brands in targeted verticals to maximize audience reach, enhance engagement, and optimize monetization of digital publishing assets for the benefit of its users, its advertiser clients, and its greater than 40 owned and operated properties as well as properties it runs on behalf of independent Publisher Partners. The Company owns and operates TheStreet, The Spun, Parade, and Men's Journal and powers more than 320 independent Publisher Partners, including the many sports team sites that comprise FanNation.

Each Publisher Partner joins the Platform by invitation only with the objective of improving our position in key verticals while optimizing the performance of the Publisher Partner. Publisher Partners incur the costs in content creation on their respective channels and receive a share of the revenue associated with their content. Because of the state-of-the-art technology and large scale of the Platform and our expertise in search engine optimization, social media, ad monetization and subscription marketing, Publisher Partners continually benefit from our ongoing technological advances and audience development expertise. Additionally, we believe the lead brands within our verticals create a halo benefit for all Publisher Partners while each of them adds to the breadth and quality of content.

## Platform

The Company developed the Platform, a proprietary online publishing platform that provides its owned and operated media businesses, Publisher Partners (who are third parties producing and publishing content on their own domains), and individual creators contributing content to its owned and operated sites ("Expert Contributors"), the ability to produce and manage editorially focused content through tools and services provided by it. The Company has also developed proprietary advertising technology, techniques and relationships that allow it, its Publisher Partners, and its Expert Contributors to monetize editorially focused online content through various display and video advertisements and tools and services for driving a subscription or membership based business and other monetization services (the "Monetization Solutions" and, together with the Platform, the "Platform Services"). The Company's Platform offers audiences bespoke content with optimized design and page construction.

The Platform comprises state-of-the-art publishing tools, video platforms, social distribution channels, newsletter technology, machine learning content recommendations, notifications, and other technology that deliver a complete set of features to drive a digital media business in an entirely cloud-based suite of services. The Company's software engineering and product development teams are experienced at delivering these services at scale. The Company continues to develop the Platform software by combining proprietary code with components from the open-source community, plus select commercial services as well as identifying, acquiring, and integrating other platform technologies where it sees unique long-term benefits to it.

## Seasonality

The Company does experience seasonality during the year, as a result of advertising seasonality and sports seasons and major sporting events. Advertising typically peaks in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year as advertisers concentrate their budgets during the holiday season. This trend is magnified as it also includes the professional sports and college football seasons, which account for a significant portion of the Company's advertising revenue during that period of the year. Other sporting events such as the Super Bowl, Winter and Summer Olympics, soccer's World Cup, and major golf, tennis and cycling events create increased traffic surrounding the respective events.

## Going Concern

The Company performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company's consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if it is unable to continue as a going concern.

F-9

Most recently, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $55,582, had cash on hand of $9,284 and a working capital deficit of $145,622. The Company's net loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit its ability to meet its obligations when due. Also, since the Company's 2023 Notes (see Note 18), Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes (see Note 19) (collectively "its current debt") are subject to a forbearance period through the earlier of the following: (a) April 30, 2024 ; (b) the occurrence of the closing of the Business Combination and (c) the termination of the Business Combination prior to closing (as further described in Note 28) unless the Company is able to refinance or modify the terms of its current debt it runs the risk that its debt could be called, therefore, it may not be able to meet its obligations when due.

In its evaluation, management determined there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date, unless it is able to refinance or modify its current debt.

The Company plans to refinance or modify the maturities of its current debt and complete the Business Combination to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance or modify its current debt and complete the Business Combination.

## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the financial statements of The Arena Group and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Arena Media, Arena Platform, TheStreet, The Spun and Parade. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period. Significant estimates include: reserves for bad debt; capitalization of platform development and associated useful lives; goodwill and other acquired intangible assets and associated useful lives; assumptions used in accruals for potential liabilities; revenue recognition and estimates of standalone selling price of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations; stock-based compensation and the determination of the fair value; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; accounting for business combinations; and assumptions used to calculate contingent liabilities. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management's estimates.

## Risks and Uncertainties

The Company's business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions include shortterm and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets and the general condition of the United States and world economy. A host of factors beyond the Company's control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse developments in these general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the results of its operations.

## F-10

In addition, the Company will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded projects, marketing and sales operations as well as extensive human capital. The Company may be unable to compete successfully against these companies. The Company's industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and market demands. As a result, the Company's products, services, or expertise may become obsolete or unmarketable. The Company's future success will depend on its ability to adapt to technological advances, anticipate customer and market demands, and enhance its current technology under development.

Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to the Company's business. Increases in inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the global banking system, geopolitical factors, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the responses thereto, and the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on the Company's business. While the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of its business, the ultimate extent of the impact on its business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of the Company's control and could exist for an extended period of time. As a result, the Company is subject to continuing risks and uncertainties.

Effective December 1, 2023, B. Riley FBR, Inc. ("B. Riley FBR"), a registered broker-dealer owned by B. Riley Financial, Inc., a diversified publicly traded financial services company ("B. Riley") that was instrumental in providing investment banking services to the Company and in raising debt and equity capital for the Company, and Renew Group Private Limited ("Renew") entered into agreement where Renew purchased $110,691 in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding with B. Riley, including the 2023 Notes (as described in Note 18), Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes (as described in Note 19), which constitute all of the notes outstanding with B. Riley and also assumed the role of agent under the Note Purchase Agreement, as further described in Note 26. The indirect owner of Renew also has an indirect non-controlling interest in Simplify Inventions, LLC ("Simplify"), a principal stockholder (as further described in Note 26).

## Segment Reporting

The Company operates in one reportable segment which focuses on a publishing platform. The Company's business offerings have similar operating characteristics and similar long-term operating performance, including the types of customers, nature of product or services, distribution methods and regulatory environment. The chief operating decision maker (the "CODM") of the Company reviews specific financial and operational data and other key metrics to make resource allocation decisions and assesses performance by review of profit and loss information on a consolidated basis. The CODM does not review specific financial or operational data on a disaggregated basis or by aggregating operating segments into one reportable segment. The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial results of the Company's one reportable segment.

## Revenue Recognition

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. The Company accounts for revenue on a gross basis, as compared to a net basis, on its statements of operations. The Company has made this determination based on its control of the advertising inventory and the ability to monetize the advertising inventory or publications before transfer to the customer and because it is also the primary obligor responsible for providing the services to the customer. Cost of revenue is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

F-11

The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates revenue:

## Advertising Revenue

Digital Advertising The Company recognizes revenue from digital advertisements at the point when each ad is viewed. The quantity of advertisements, the impression bid prices and revenue are reported on a real-time basis. The Company enters into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with its various channels. Although reported advertising transactions are subject to adjustment by the advertising network partners, any such adjustments are known within a few days of month end. The Company owes its independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the advertising revenue earned, which is recorded as service costs in the same period in which the associated advertising revenue is recognized.

Advertising revenue that is comprised of fees charged for the placement of advertising, on the Company's flagship website, TheStreet.com, is recognized as the advertising or sponsorship is displayed, if collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Print Advertising Advertising related revenues for print advertisements are recognized when advertisements are published (defined as an issue's on-sale date), net of provisions for estimated rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts.

## Subscription Revenue

Digital Subscriptions - The Company enters into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on the owned and operated media channels and

facilitate such contracts between internet users and its Publisher Partners. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription to access the premium content. The Company owes its independent Publisher Partners a revenue share of the membership subscription revenue earned, which is initially deferred and recorded as deferred contract costs. The Company recognizes deferred contract costs over the membership subscription term in the same pattern that the associated membership subscription revenue is recognized.

Subscription revenue generated from the Company's flagship website TheStreet.com from institutional and retail customers is comprised of subscriptions and license fees for access to securities investment information, stock market commentary, director and officer profiles, relationship capital management services, and transactional information pertaining to mergers and acquisitions and other changes in the corporate control environment. Subscriptions are charged to customers' credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers, and are generally billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The Company calculates net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges. Net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods. Unearned revenue relates to payments for subscription fees for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided.

## Print Revenue

Print revenue includes magazine subscriptions and single copy sales at newsstands.

Print Subscriptions Revenue from magazine subscriptions is deferred and recognized proportionately as products are distributed to subscribers.

Newsstand - Single copy revenue is recognized on the publication's on-sale date, net of provisions for estimated returns. The Company bases its estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

## Licensing and Syndication Revenue

Content licensing-based revenues and syndication revenues are accrued generally monthly or quarterly based on the specific mechanisms of each contract. Generally, revenues are accrued based on estimated sales and adjusted as actual sales are reported by partners. These adjustments are typically recorded within three months of the initial estimates and have not been material. Any minimum guarantees are typically earned evenly over the fiscal year.

## Nature of Performance Obligations

At contract inception, the Company assesses the obligations promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service or bundle that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all the promises in the contract, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied, and control is transferred to the customer.

Digital Advertising - The Company sells digital advertising inventory on its websites directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies. The Company's performance obligations related to digital advertising are generally satisfied when the advertisement is run on the Company's platform. The price for direct digital advertising is determined in contracts with the advertisers. Revenue from the sale of direct digital advertising is recognized when the advertisements are delivered based on the contract. The customer is invoiced the agreed-upon price in the month following the month that the advertisements are delivered with normal trade terms. The agreed upon price is adjusted for estimated provisions for rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts. As part of the Company's customary business practices, digital advertising contracts may include a guaranteed number of impressions and sales incentives to its customers including volume discounts, rebates, value added impressions, etc. For all such contracts that include these types of variable consideration, the Company estimates the variable consideration and factors in such an estimate when determining the transaction price.

Print Advertising -The Company provides advertisement placements in print media directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies. The Company's performance obligations related to print advertising are satisfied when the magazine in which an advertisement appears is published, which is defined as an issue's on-sale date. The customer is invoiced the agreed-upon price when the advertisements are published under normal industry trade terms. The agreed upon price is adjusted for estimated provisions for rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts. As part of the Company's customary business practices, print advertising contracts include guaranteed circulation levels of magazines, referred to as rate base, and a number of sales incentives to its customers including volume discounts, rebates, bonus pages, etc. For all such contracts that include these types of variable consideration, the Company estimates such when determining the transaction price.

Digital Subscriptions - The Company recognizes revenue from each membership subscription to access the premium content over time based on a daily calculation of revenue during the reporting period, which is generally one year. Subscriber payments are initially recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheets. As the Company provides access to the premium content over the membership subscription term, the Company recognizes revenue and proportionately reduces the unearned revenue balance.

Print Subscriptions - The Company sells magazines to consumers through subscriptions. Each copy of a magazine is determined to be a distinct performance obligation that is satisfied when the publication is sent to the customer. The majority of the Company's subscription sales are prepaid at the time of order. Subscriptions may be canceled at any time for a refund of the price paid for remaining issues. As the contract may be canceled at any time for a full refund of the unserved copies, the contract term is determined to be on an issue-to-issue basis as these contracts do not have substantive termination penalties. Revenues from subscriptions are deferred and recognized proportionately as subscribers are served. Some magazine subscription offers contain more than one magazine title in a bundle. The Company allocates the total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation, or magazine title, based on a standalone-selling price basis.

Newsstand - The Company sells single copy magazines, or bundles of single copy magazines, to wholesalers for ultimate resale on newsstands primarily at major retailers and grocery/drug stores, and in digital form on tablets and other electronic devices. Publications sold to magazine wholesalers are sold with the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to the wholesaler by retailers. Revenue is recognized on the issue's on-sale date as the date aligns most closely with the date that control is transferred to the customer. The Company bases its estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.

## F-13

Licensing and Syndication The Company has entered into various licensing and syndication agreements that provide third party partners with the right to utilize the Company's content. Functional licenses in national media consist of content licensing.

## Timing of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations

Point-in-Time Performance Obligations For performance obligations related to certain digital advertising space and sales of print advertisements, the Company determines that the customer can direct the use of and obtain substantially all the benefits from the advertising products as the digital impressions are served or on the issue's on-sale date. For performance obligations related to sales of magazines through subscriptions, the customer obtains control when each magazine issue is mailed to the customer on or before the issue's on-sale date. For sales of single copy magazines on newsstands, revenue is recognized on the issue's on-sale date as the date aligns most closely with the date that control is transferred to the customer. Revenues from functional licenses and syndication arrangements are recognized at a point-

e when access to the completed content is granted to the partner.

Over-Time Performance Obligations -For performance obligations related to sales of certain digital advertising space, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue over time by measuring progress towards complete satisfaction using the most appropriate method.

For performance obligations related to digital advertising, the Company satisfies its performance obligations on some flat-fee digital advertising placements over time using a time-elapsed output method.

Determining a measure of progress requires management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. The Company has determined that the above method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services to the customer. For performance obligations recognized using a time-elapsed output method, the Company's efforts are expended evenly throughout the period.

Performance obligations related to subscriptions to premium content on the digital media channels provides access for a given period of time, which is generally one year. The Company recognizes revenue from each membership subscription over time based on a daily calculation of revenue during the reporting period.

## Transaction Price and Amounts Allocated to Performance Obligations

Determining the Transaction Price Certain advertising contracts contain variable components of the transaction price, such as volume discounts and rebates. The Company has sufficient historical data and has established processes to reliably estimate these variable components of the transaction price.

Subscription revenue generated from the flagship website TheStreet.com is subject to estimation and variability due to the fact that, in the normal course of business, subscribers may for various reasons contact the Company or their credit card companies to request a refund or other adjustment for a previously purchased subscription. With respect to many of the Company's annual newsletter subscription products, the Company offers the ability to receive a refund during the first 30 days but none thereafter. Accordingly, the Company maintains a provision for estimated future revenue reductions resulting from expected refunds and chargebacks related to subscriptions for which revenue was recognized in a prior period. The calculation of this provision is based upon historical trends and is reevaluated each quarter.

The Company typically does not offer any type of variable consideration in standard magazine subscription contracts. For these contracts, the transaction price is fixed upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale including description, quantity and price of each subscription purchased. Therefore, the Company does not estimate variable consideration or perform a constraint analysis for these contracts.

A right of return exists for newsstand contracts. The Company has sufficient historical data to estimate the final amount of returns and reduces the transaction price at contract inception for the expected return reserve.

There is no variable consideration related to functional licenses.

F-14

Estimating Standalone-Selling Prices -For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone-selling price basis. The standalone-selling price is the price at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to the customer. In situations in which an obligation is bundled with other obligations and the total amount of consideration does not reflect the sum of individual observable prices, the Company allocates the discount to (1) a single obligation if the discount is attributable to that obligation or (2) prorates across all obligations if the discount relates to the bundle. When standalone-selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates and considers all the information that is reasonably available to the Company, including market conditions, entity specific factors, customer information, etc. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.

Measuring Obligations for Returns and Refunds - The Company accepts product returns in some cases. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors and the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a subscription refund liability of $449 and $845, respectively, was recorded for the provision for the estimated returns and refunds on the consolidated balance sheets.

## Contract Modifications

The Company occasionally enters into amendments to previously executed contracts that constitute contract modifications. The Company assesses each of these contract modifications to determine:

- ● if the additional services and goods are distinct from the services and goods in the original arrangement; and
- ● if the amount of consideration expected for the added services or goods reflects the stand-alone selling price of those services and goods.

A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. A contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, or a cumulative catch-up basis (further details are provided under the headings Contract Balances and Subscription Acquisition Costs ).

The cost of revenue that the Company has incurred in the periods presented primarily include: Publisher Partner guarantees and revenue share payments; amortization of developed technology and platform development; royalty fees; hosting and bandwidth and software license fees; printing and distribution costs; payroll and related expenses for customer support, technology maintenance; fees paid for data analytics and to other outside service providers; and stock-based compensation of related personnel (as described in Note 22).

F-16

## Contract Balances

The timing of the Company's performance under its various contracts often differs from the timing of the customer's payment, which results in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability. A contract asset is recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer and the Company does not have the contractual right to bill for the related performance obligations. An asset is recognized when certain costs incurred to obtain a contract meet the capitalization criteria (further details are provided under the heading Subscription Acquisition Costs ). A contract liability is recognized when consideration is received from the customer prior to the transfer of goods or services.

The following table provides information about contract balances:

|                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                                     | 2023                 | 2022                 |
| Unearned revenue (short-term contract liabilities): |                      |                      |
| Digital revenue                                     | $ 14,397             | $ 18,571             |
| Print revenue                                       | 45,389               | 40,132               |
|                                                     | $ 59,786             | $ 58,703             |
| Unearned revenue (long-term contract liabilities):  |                      |                      |
| Digital revenue                                     | $ 542                | $ 1,118              |
| Print revenue                                       | 10,137               | 18,583               |
|                                                     | $ 10,679             | $ 19,701             |

Unearned Revenue - Unearned revenue, also referred to as contract liabilities, include payments received in advance of performance under the contracts and are recognized as revenue over time. The Company records contract liabilities as unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Digital subscription and print subscription revenue of $68,985 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 from unearned revenue at the beginning of the year.

During January 2020, February 2020 and December 2021, the Company modified certain digital and print subscription contracts that prospectively changed the frequency of the related issues (or magazines) required to be delivered on a yearly basis (the "Contract Modifications"). The Company determined that the remaining digital content and magazines to be delivered are distinct from the digital content or magazines already provided under the original contract. As a result, the Company in effect established a new contract that included only the remaining digital content or magazines. Accordingly, the Company allocated the remaining performance obligations in the contracts as consideration from the original contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $554 and $2,986, respectively, resulting from the Contract Modifications.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at banks where amounts on deposit may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit during the year. Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments with an original contractual maturity at the date of purchase of three months. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of checking, savings deposits and money market accounts. These deposits exceeded federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk regarding its cash and cash equivalents.

The following table reconciles total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash:

|                                                   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                                   | 2023                 | 2022                 |
| Cash and cash equivalents                         | 9,284                | 13,871               |
| Restricted cash                                   | -                    | 502                  |
| Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash | 9,284                | 14,373               |

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had restricted cash of $0 and $502, which served as collateral for certain credit card merchant accounts with a bank.

## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company receives payments from advertising customers based upon contractual payment terms; accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected within 90 days. The Company generally receives payments from digital and print subscription customers at the time of sign up for each subscription; accounts receivable from merchant credit card processors are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are generally collected weekly. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses

resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company's ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $44,811 and $33,950, respectively, are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts.

The following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:

|                                                   | Years Ended of December 31,   | Years Ended of December 31,   |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|                                                   | 2023                          | 2022                          |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts beginning of year | $ 2,236                       | $ 1,578                       |
| Additions                                         | 315                           | 658                           |
| Deductions - write-offs                           | (1,570 )                      | -                             |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts end of year       | $ 981                         | $ 2,236                       |

## Subscription Acquisition Costs

Subscription acquisition costs include the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, paid to external parties, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has determined that sales commissions paid on all third party agent sales of subscriptions are direct and incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and, therefore, meet the capitalization criteria. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to amortize these costs at the portfolio level. The sales commissions paid to third party agents are amortized as the magazines are sent to the subscriber on an issue-by-issue basis. The Company determined that commissions paid for subscriber renewal contracts to all third party agents are not from a specifically anticipated future contract, therefore, the commissions paid on renewals are amortized as the magazines are sent to the subscriber over the renewal term on an issue-by-issue basis. Direct mail costs for renewal subscriptions are expensed as incurred since they do not meet the capitalization criteria.

Amortization of subscription acquisition costs of $38,112 and $37,190 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included within selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. No impairment losses have been recognized for subscription acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Contract Modifications resulted in subscription acquisition costs to be recognized on a prospective basis in the same proportion as the revenue that has not yet been recognized.

The current portion of the subscription acquisition costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $29,706 and $25,931, respectively. The noncurrent portion of the subscription acquisition costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7,215 and $14,133, respectively. Subscription acquisition costs as of December 31, 2023 presented as current assets of $29,706 are expected to be amortized over a one-year period, or through December 31, 2024, and presented as long-term assets of $ 7,215 are expected to be amortized after the one-year period ending December 31, 2024.

## Concentrations

Significant Customers - Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to customers to whom the Company makes significant sales. While a reserve for the potential write-off of accounts receivable is maintained, the Company has not written off any material accounts to date. To control credit risk, the Company performs regular credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

Revenue from significant customers as a percentage of the Company's total revenue represent approximately10.0% from a customer for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue from significant customers as a percentage of the Company's total revenue represent 13.9% from a customer for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Significant Vendors - Concentrations of risk with respect to third party vendors who provide products and services to the Company are limited. If not limited, such concentrations could impact profitability if a vendor failed to fulfill their obligations or if a significant vendor was unable to renew an existing contract and the Company was not able to replace the related product or service at the same cost.

Significant accounts payable balances as a percentage of the Company's total accounts payable represent12.2%, and 14.1% from a vendor for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for its offices. Leases are recorded as an operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. At inception, the Company determines whether an arrangement that provides control over the use of an asset is a lease. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the renewal period, the Company includes the impact of the renewal in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included on the consolidated statements of operations when realized. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

| Office equipment and computers   | 1 - 3 years   |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Furniture and fixtures           | 1 - 5 years   |

## Platform Development

The Company capitalizes platform development costs for internal use when planning and design efforts are successfully completed, and development is ready to commence. The Company places capitalized platform development assets into service and commences amortization when the applicable project or asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Once placed into service, the Company capitalizes qualifying costs of specified upgrades or enhancements to capitalized platform development assets when the upgrade or enhancement will result in new or additional functionality.

The Company capitalizes internal labor costs, including payroll-based and stock-based compensation, benefits and payroll taxes, that are incurred for certain capitalized platform development projects related to the Platform. The Company's policy with respect to capitalized internal labor stipulates that labor costs for employees working on eligible internal use capital projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of the project when the impact, as compared to expensing such labor costs, is material.

Platform development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which is the estimated useful life of the related asset and is recorded in cost of revenue

## Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that the purchase price, including the fair value of contingent consideration, of the acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the estimated fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net fair values of the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Company's estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent the Company identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company identifies acquisition-related contingent payments and determines their respective fair values as of the acquisition date, which are recorded as accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent payments are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company expenses transaction costs related to the acquisition as incurred.

## Intangible Assets

Intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of developed technology and trade names, are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. A finite lived intangible asset is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized.

## Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily by reference to the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually on December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company operates as one reporting unit, therefore, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of Company's reporting unit to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities.

## Debt Costs

Debt costs consist of cash and noncash consideration paid to lenders and third parties with respect to debt and other financing transactions, including legal fees and placement fees. Such costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt. Upon the settlement of debt the pro rata portion of any related unamortized debt costs are charged to operations.

F-20

Additional consideration in the form of warrants and other derivative financial instruments issued to lenders are accounted for at fair value utilizing information determined by consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm. The fair value of warrants and derivatives are recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related debt and amortized to interest expense over the term of such debt, with the initial offsetting entries recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. Upon the settlement of the debt the pro rata portion of any related unamortized debt cost is charged to operations.

## Liquidated Damages

The Company incurred liquidated damages when: (i) a registration rights agreement provides for damages if the Company does not register the shares of the Company's common stock within the requisite time frame (the "Registration Rights Damages"), which, in general, provides for a cash payment equal to 1.0% per month of the amount invested, on a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a month, as partial liquidated damages per month, upon the occurrence of certain events, up to a maximum amount of 6.0% of the aggregate amount invested, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full; and (ii) a securities purchase agreement provides for damages if the Company fails for any reason to satisfy a public information requirement within the requisite time frame with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") (the "Public Information Failure Damages"), which, in general, provides for a cash payment equal to 1.0% of the aggregate amount invested for each 30-day period, or pro rata portion thereof, as partial liquidated damages per month, up to a maximum of 6 months, subject to interest at the rate of 1.0% per month until paid in full. Collectively, the Registration Rights Damages and the Public Information Failure Damages are referred to as the "Liquidated Damages" on the consolidated balance sheets.

## Selling and Marketing

Selling and marketing expenses consist of compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation of selling and marketing, account management support teams, as well as commissions, travel, trade show sponsorships and events, conferences and advertising costs. The Company's advertising expenses relate to direct-mail costs for magazine subscription acquisition efforts, and print and digital advertising that are expensed when an advertisement takes place. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred advertising expenses of $4,372 and $5,987, respectively, which are included within selling and marketing on the consolidated statements of operations.

## General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll for executive personnel, technology personnel incurred in developing conceptual formulation and determination of existence of needed technology, and administrative personnel along with any related payroll costs; professional services, including accounting, legal and insurance; facilities costs; conferences; other general corporate expenses; and stock-based compensation of related personnel.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for freestanding contracts that are settleable in the Company's equity securities, including the put option on the Company's common stock, to be designated as an equity instrument, generally as a liability. A contract so designated is carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, with any changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss on the consolidated statements of operations, with no impact on cash flows.

At the date of settlement of a freestanding equity contract, the pro rata fair value of the related liability is transferred to additional paid-in capital.

## F-21

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The authoritative guidance with respect to fair value established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.

Level 1 . Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded securities and exchange-based derivatives.

Level 2 . Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.

Level 3 . Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds and are measured using present value pricing models.

The Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.

The carrying amount of the Company's financial instruments comprising of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

## Preferred Stock

Preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock") (as described in Note 20) is reported as a mezzanine obligation between liabilities and stockholders' deficiency. If it becomes probable that the Preferred Stock will become redeemable, the Company will re-measure the Preferred Stock by adjusting the carrying value to the redemption value of the Preferred Stock assuming each balance sheet date is a redemption date.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company provides stock-based compensation in the form of (a) stock awards to employees and directors, comprised of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, (b) stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, (c) common stock warrants to Publisher Partners (no warrants were issued during the year ended December 31, 2022) (further details are provided under the headings Publisher Partner Warrants and New Publisher Partner Warrants in Note 22), and (d) common stock warrants to ABG (further details are provided under the heading ABG Warrants in Note 22).

The Company accounts for stock awards and stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, and non-employee awards to certain directors and consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the stock-based payments as compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees and non-employees which are time-vested, are measured at fair value on the grant date, and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees and non-employees which are performance-vested, are measured at fair value on the grant date and charged to operations when the performance condition is satisfied or over the service period.

## F-22

The fair value measurement of stock awards and grants used for stock-based compensation is as follows: (1) restricted stock awards and restricted stock units which are time-vested, are determined using the quoted market price of the Company's common stock at the grant date; (2) stock option grants which are time-vested and performance-vested, are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date; (3) restricted stock units and stock option grants which provide for market-based vesting with a time-vesting overlay, are determined through consultants with the Company's independent valuation firm using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date; (4) Publisher Partner Warrants were determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model; and (5) ABG warrants are determined utilizing the Monte Carlo model (further details are provided in Note 22). Estimated volatility was determined under the (1) "Probability Weighted Scenarios" (prior to the reverse stock split on February 8, 2022) where one scenario assumes that the Company's common stock will be up-listed on a national stock exchange (the "Exchange") on a certain listing date (the "Up-list") where the estimated volatility was based on evaluating the average historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are publicly traded and the second scenario assumes that the Company's common stock is not up-listed on the Exchange prior to the final vesting date of the grants (the "No Up-list") where the historical volatility of the Company's common stock was evaluated based upon market comparisons; and the (2) "Up-list Scenario" (after the reverse stock split on February 8, 2022) where the Company estimated volatility based on evaluating the average historical volatility of a group of peer companies that are publicly traded after the Company up-listed to the NYSE American. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company's common stock.

The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur and to recognize stock-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period for awards with graded vesting. The Company classifies stock-based compensation cost on its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's cash compensation cost is classified.

## Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement bases of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in the income tax rates on deferred tax asset and liability balances is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such rate change. A valuation allowance is recorded for loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that such loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company follows accounting guidance that sets forth a threshold for financial statement recognition, measurement, and disclosure of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Such guidance requires the Company to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits of the position.

## Loss per Common Share

Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as stock options, restricted stock, and warrants. All restricted stock awards are considered outstanding but are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. Restricted stock units are included in the computation of basic loss per common share only when the restrictions expire, the shares are no longer forfeitable, and are thus vested. Contingently issuable shares are included in basic loss per common share only when there are no circumstances under which those shares would not be issued. Diluted loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

## F-23

The Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below (capitalized terms are described herein), which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, from its calculation of net loss per common share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the diluted calculations when a net loss is incurred as they would be anti-dilutive.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, addressing areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard (ASU 2016-13) that introduced the current expected credit losses (CECL) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This update requires an entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. As the Company has already adopted ASU 2016-13, the new guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This update also clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction and requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. ASU 2022-03 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within the fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative , which incorporates certain SEC disclosure requirements into the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification"). The amendments are expected to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC's existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC's regulations. ASU 202306 will become effective for each amendment on the effective date of the SEC's corresponding disclosure rule changes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted using either a prospective or retrospective transition method. The Company expects ASU 2023-09 to require additional disclosures in the notes to its consolidated financial statements.

## F-24

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.

## 3. Discontinued Operations

The Company, upon Board approval on September 15, 2022, discontinued (i.e., the "discontinued operations") the Parade print business ("Parade Print") that was acquired on April 1, 2022 (as part of the Parade acquisition, as further described below in Note 4), on November 13, 2022 (the last date of any obligation to deliver issues of Parade Print).

The table below sets forth the loss from discontinued operations for the period from April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022:

| Revenue         | 26,817   |
|-----------------|----------|
| Cost of revenue | 23,015   |
| Gross profit    | 3,802    |

|                                       | Operating expense   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Selling and marketing                 | 5,396               |
| General and administrative            | 1,722               |
| Loss on impairment of assets          | 209                 |
| Total operating expenses              | 7,327               |
| Loss from discontinued operations     | (3,525 )            |
| Income tax benefit                    | 55                  |
| Net loss from discontinued operations | $ (3,470 )          |

The discontinued operations of Parade Print also included Relish and Spry Living print products that were acquired as part of the Parade acquisition. Further information is provided under the heading Supplemental Pro Forma Information in Note 4.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded depreciation and amortization of $0; and operating and investing noncash items of $209 and $0, respectively, as part of the discontinued operations.

## 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which is based on ASC, Business Combinations (Topic 805) , and uses the fair value concepts which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.

## 2023 Acquisition

Teneology, Inc. - On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Teneology, Inc., ("Teneology") pursuant to which it acquired certain assets (consisting of the RoadFood media business, including digital and television assets; the Moveable Feast media business, including digital and television assets; the Fexy-branded content studio business; and the MonkeySee YouTube Channel media business, collectively "Fexy Studios"), for a purchase price of $3,307. The purchase price consisted of the following: (1) $500 cash paid at closing (including an advance payment of $250 prior to closing); (2) $75 deferred cash payments due in three equal installments of $25 on March 1, 2023 (paid), April 1, 2023 (paid) and May 1, 2023 (paid); (3) $200 deferred cash payment due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to certain indemnity provisions (not paid in January 2024, further details are provided under the heading Fexy Put Option in Note 28); and (4) the issuance of 274,692 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain lock-up provisions, with a fair value of $2,000 on the transaction closing date (fair value was determined based on an independent appraisal); and which is subject to a put option under certain conditions (the "contingent consideration") (as further described below in Note 17). The number of shares of the Company's common stock issued was determined based on a $2,225 value using the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the January 11, 2023 closing date (on the closing date the common stock trading price was $7.94 per share). The agreement also provided for a cash retention pool for certain employees of $300, subject to vesting over three years upon continued employment and other conditions.

## F-25

The composition of the purchase price is as follows:

| Cash                                  | $ 500   |
|---------------------------------------|---------|
| Common stock                          | 2,000   |
| Contingent consideration              | 561     |
| Deferred cash payments, as discounted | 246     |
| Total purchase consideration          | $ 3,307 |

The Company accounted for the asset acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 since the acquisition met the definition of a business under the applicable guidance.

The Company incurred $99 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Advertiser relationships   | 663   |
|----------------------------|-------|
| Brand names                | 659   |
| Goodwill                   | 1,985 |
| Net assets acquired        | 3,307 |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the advertiser relationships were valued using the excess earnings method of the income approach and the brand names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The estimated useful life is fifteen years (15.0 years) for the advertiser relationships and twelve years (12.0 years) for the brand names.

The excess-of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. The Company expects $1,678 of goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.

## Supplemental Pro Forma Information

The pro forma disclosures have been deemed impracticable for this acquisition since after making reasonable efforts the Company is unable to accept assumptions made by Teneology. The Company has determined, based on the information provided by Teneology and made available to the Company, that the earnings from the prior periods could not be verified since the acquisition only included certain activities of Teneology and financial statements were not available. In this regard, the Company: (1) made reasonable effort to obtain certain financial results of the certain activities but Teneology was unable to comply with this request; and (2) the presentation of the pro forma results and the assumptions made by Teneology management were unable to be independently substantiated.

## F-26

## 2023 Disposition

On November 17, 2023, the Company sold certain assets related to one of Parade's business components known as Athlon Outdoors for cash proceeds of $1,061 ($1,000 sale price (with a target working capital of $272) plus a preliminary working capital adjustment of $61), as further reduced by a final working capital adjustment of

$153, as reflected in accrued expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets, resulting in a final sale price of $908. In connection with the sale, the Company disposed of certain advertiser relationships and trade name relating to that business component with a carrying value of $639 and $172, respectively, along with the accounts receivable and accounts payable of the business component of $453 and $31, respectively, resulting in a recognized loss on sale of assets of $325 as reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.

## 2022 Acquisitions

Athlon Holdings, Inc . - On April 1, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Athlon Holdings, Inc. (or Parade), a Tennessee corporation, for a purchase price of $15,854, as adjusted for the working capital adjustment as of the closing date of the transaction. The working capital adjustment is pending acceptance by the sellers (further details are provided in Note 27). As a part of the closing consideration, the Company also acquired cash of $1,840, that was further adjusted post-closing for the working capital adjustment. The purchase price of $15,854, as discounted, is comprised of (i) a cash portion of $12,827, with $11,840 paid at closing and $987 estimated to be paid post-closing (as further described below) and (ii) the issuance of314,103 shares of the Company's common stock with a fair market value of $3,141. The number of shares of the Company's common stock issued was determined based on a $3,000 value using the common stock trading price for the 10 trading days preceding the April 1, 2022 closing date. Certain of Parade's key employees entered into either advisory agreements or employment agreements with the Company. Parade operates in the United States.

The amount estimated to be paid post-closing of $987 will be or was paid as follows: (i) $742 is expected to be paid upon receipts of certain tax refunds due to the sellers (consisting of $3,000 for the deferred cash payments, as discounted, less a $2,258 cash adjustment); and (ii) $245 was paid within two business days from the date the Company received proceeds from the sale of the equity interest in Just Like Falling Off a Bike, LLC that was held by Parade as of the closing date (paid on April 7, 2022).

The Company received a final valuation report from a third party valuation firm after the preliminary purchase price was adjusted during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022. After considering the results of the final valuation report, the Company estimated that the purchase consideration decreased by $321. The decrease in the purchase price was related to an increase in identifiable assets of $54, an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $27, with a decrease in the working capital adjustment of $321, resulting in a decrease in goodwill of $348.

The composition of the purchase price is as follows:

| Cash                                  | 12,085   |
|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Common stock                          | 3,141    |
| Deferred cash payments, as discounted | 628      |
| Total purchase consideration          | 15,854   |

The Company incurred $200 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded within general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Cash                        | $ 2,604   |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Accounts receivable         | 10,855    |
| Other current assets        | 1,337     |
| Equity investment           | 2,450     |
| Fixed assets                | 108       |
| Digital content             | 355       |
| Advertiser relationships    | 6,202     |
| Trade names                 | 2,261     |
| Goodwill                    | 2,587     |
| Accounts payable            | (7,416 )  |
| Accrued expenses and other  | (2,440 )  |
| Unearned revenue            | (1,203 )  |
| Other long-term liabilities | (543 )    |
| Deferred tax liabilities    | (1,303 )  |
| Net assets acquired         | $ 15,854  |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the digital content was determined using a cost approach. The fair values of the advertiser relationships were determined by projecting the acquired entity's cash flows, deducting notional contributory asset charges on supporting assets (working capital, tangible assets, trade names, and the assembled workforce) to compute the excess cash flows associated with the advertiser relationships. The fair values of the trade names were determined by projecting revenue associated with each trade name and applying a royalty rate to compute the amount of the royalty payments the company is relieved from paying due to its ownership of the trade names. The estimated weighted average useful life is two years (2.00 years) for digital content, eight point seventy-five years (8.75 years) for advertiser relationships, and fourteen point five years (14.50 years) for trade names.

The excess purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. No portion of the goodwill related to the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.

The purchase consideration totaled $850, which was assigned to the brand name acquired on the closing date of the acquisition. The useful life for the brand name is ten years (10.0 years).

A360 Media, LLC - On December 15, 2022 (the closing date), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered into December 7, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities from Weider Publications, a subsidiary of A360 Media, LLC (or Men's Journal) related to the digital media operations of Men's Journal and other men's active lifestyle brands. The Company paid $25,000 in cash for the acquisition consisting of: (i) $23,000 paid at closing; (ii) $1,000 deposited into an escrow account to be released in accordance with the terms of the agreement, subject to adjustments for any indemnification payments; and (iii) $1,000 paid in November 2022. The Company also assumed certain liabilities consisting of: (i) $2,676 an assumed lease obligation, as discounted (representing $3,189 in deferred payments over twenty-seven months (27) for the assumption of a lease obligation); and (ii) $4,078 in deferred revenue obligations to deliver certain publications to the subscribers of Men's Journal ($3,941 in unearned revenue after consideration of an estimated subscription refund liability of $137). In accordance with the practical expedients under ASU 2021-08, the Company has elected to apply (i) the practical expedient to the modification of the subscriber contracts at the acquisition date to determine the performance obligations and transaction price; and (ii) to use the estimated selling price of a subscriber contract as the standalone selling price of the replacement magazine based on the number of magazines expected to be delivered to the Men's Journal subscribers to satisfy the performance obligations. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. Men's Journal operates in the United States.

The Company accounted for the asset acquisition as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 since the acquisition met the definition of a business under the applicable guidance.

The Company incurred $283 in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which primarily consisted of legal and accounting expenses. The acquisition-related expenses were recorded within general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

In connection with the acquisition of Men's Journal, the Company received a final valuation report during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023 from a third party valuation firm after the preliminary purchase price was determined. After considering the results of the final valuation report, the Company estimated that the purchase consideration increased by $1,246 as a result of an increase in the fair value of the assumed lease obligation with an offset recorded to goodwill (see Note 11).

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the closing date of the acquisition based upon their respective fair values as summarized below:

| Lease deposit receivable      | $ 420    |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| Advertiser relationships      | 6,860    |
| Brand names                   | 6,090    |
| Goodwill                      | 18,384   |
| Unearned revenue              | (3,941 ) |
| Subscription refund liability | (137 )   |
| Assumed lease obligation      | (2,676 ) |
| Net assets acquired           | $ 25,000 |

The Company utilized an independent appraisal firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which required certain significant management assumptions and estimates. The fair value of the advertiser relationships were determined by applying the multi-period earnings method of the income approach and the fair values of the brand names were determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. The estimated weighted average useful life is twelve and one-half years (12.5 years) for the advertiser relationships and eleven years (11.0 years) for the brand names.

The excess-of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as a non-current asset that is not amortized but is subject to an annual review for impairment. The Company expects $12,299 of goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.

## Supplemental Pro Forma Information

The pro forma disclosures have been deemed impracticable for this acquisition since after making reasonable efforts the Company is unable to accept assumptions made by Men's Journal. The Company has determined, based on the information provided by Men's Journal and made available to the Company, that the earnings from the prior periods could not be verified since the acquisition only included certain activities of Men's Journal and financial statements were not available. In this regard, the Company: (1) made reasonable effort to obtain certain financial results of the certain activities but Men's Journal was unable to apply the requirement; and (2) the presentation of the pro forma results and the assumptions made by management were unable be independently substantiated.

F-30

The table below presents supplemental information related to the operating lease:

|                                                                                        | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |

The Company performs its annual impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. Management determined that the Company would be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill.

The Company, as part of its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill of its one reporting unit, performs the goodwill impairment test in accordance with applicable guidance. The guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit, if any. If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment test is not required. The annual impairment test was performed on December 31, 2023. No goodwill impairment was identified during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company accounted for certain common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Fexy Studios that is subject to a put option (which provides for a cash payment to the sellers on the first anniversary date of the closing (or January 11, 2024) in the event the common stock trading price on such date is less than the common stock trading price on the day immediately preceding the acquisition date, or $8.10 per share), as a derivative liability, which requires the Company to carry such amounts on its consolidated balance sheets as a liability at fair value, as adjusted at each reporting period-end (further details are provided under the heading Fexy Put Option in Note 28).

Financial instruments measured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2023, related to the Company's current debt, with a carrying value of $ 7,887 and $102,309 for the Bridge Notes and Debt as of December 31, 2023, respectively, approximates fair value due to their short nature and based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing.

Financial instruments measured at fair value during the year consisted of the following:

Contingent Consideration The fair value of the contingent consideration is primarily dependent on the common stock trading price on the first anniversary of the closing of the Fexy Studios acquisition, or January 11, 2024. The estimated fair value was calculated based on the $8.10 put option amount based on the exercise price of the Company's common stock at the acquisition date, less the $2.38 the Company's common stock trading price as of the reporting date, or $5.72 per share, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the put option of 274,692, which approximated the value if the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used given the proximity date of the put option. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the change in valuation of the contingent consideration of $1,010 was recognized in other expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Further details are provided under the heading Fexy Put Option in Note 28.

Senior Secured Notes - The carrying value of the Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) approximates fair value based on current market interest rates for debt instruments of similar credit standing and, consequently, their fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

The quantitative information utilized in the fair value calculation of the Level 3 liabilities are as follows:

Unearned Revenue - The fair value of unearned revenue remaining in connection with the 2019 acquisitions of Sports Illustrated licensed brands, was determined with the following inputs: (1) projection of when unearned revenue will be earned; (2) expense necessary to fulfill the subscriptions; (3) gross up of the fulfillment costs to include a market participant level of profitability; (4) slight premium to the fulfillment-costs plus a reasonable profit metric; and (5) reduce projected future cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The unearned revenue remaining from the acquisitions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $523 and $1,154, respectively.

The changes in unearned revenue with inputs classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are reflected within revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.

The Series G Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock, at the option of the holder, subject to certain limitations. The Company may require holders to convert all (but not less than all) of the Series G Preferred Stock or buy out all outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock at the liquidation value of $168.

The Company must make judgements as to the realization of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. To the extent that the Company believes that recovery is not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which the Company does not believe meet the "more likely than not" criteria. The Company's judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If the Company's assumptions and consequently its estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances it has established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. Based upon the Company's historical operating losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance primarily against its deferred tax assets up to the deferred tax liabilities, except for deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangible assets, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards available of $193,801, $145,968 and $53,002 respectively, to offset future taxable income. Net operating losses for U.S. federal tax purposes of $138,243 do not expire (limited to 80% of taxable income in a given year) and $55,558 will expire, if not utilized, through 2037 in various amounts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards available of $190,070, $133,419 and $51,503, respectively, to offset future taxable income

Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation's net operating losses, as well as certain recognized built-in losses and other carryforwards, after an ownership change occurs. A section 382 ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of the Company's common stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Future issuances or sales of the Company's common stock (including certain transactions involving the Company's common stock that are outside of the Company's control) could also result in an ownership change under section 382. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-change net operating losses and other losses the Company can use to reduce its taxable income generally equal to the product of the total value of the Company's outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) and the long-term tax exempt interest rate for the month of the ownership change.

F-52

The Company believes that it did have a change in control under these sections in connection with its recapitalization on November 4, 2016 and utilization of the carryforwards would be limited such that the majority of the carryforwards will never be available. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded those net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards in its deferred tax assets. The Company completed a preliminary section 382 analysis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and concluded it may have experienced an ownership change as a result of certain equity transactions during the rolling three-year period of 2021 to 2023. The Company concluded that its federal net operating loss carryforwards, including any net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the mergers during 2018 and 2019, resulted in annual limitations on the overall net operating loss carryforward and that an ownership change, if any, would impose an annual limit on the net operating loss carryforwards and could cause federal income taxes (similar provisions apply for state and local income taxes) to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. The federal, state, and local net operating loss carryforwards are stated net of any such anticipated limitations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes on the statements of operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to loss before the benefit for income taxes, as follows:

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to its unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next 12 months.

The Company did not recognize any uncertain tax position, or any accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and New York, California, and other states. The Company is generally subject to examination by income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return, therefore, the federal and certain state returns from 2020 forward and the California

returns from 2019 forward are subject to examination. The Company currently is under examination by a state tax authority.

The Company has an outstanding obligation with Renew, an affiliated entity of Simplify, where Renew purchased the all the outstanding debt held by BRF Finance Co., LLC ("BRF") an affiliated entity of B. Riley Financial, Inc. ("B. Riley") (as further described below), who now holds the debt in its capacity as agent for the purchasers and as purchaser, pursuant to the third amended and restated note purchase agreement entered into on December 15, 2022 (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), as amended by the first amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement on August 14, 2023 (the "First Amendment") with an effective date of August 31, 2023, as further amended by the second amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement on December 1, 2023 (the "Second Amendment"). The Note Purchase Agreement contains provisions related to the 2023 Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Delayed Draw Term Notes and 2022 Bridge Notes, all as further described above and referred to as the "Notes". Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, First Amendment and Second Amendment, in the event there is a mandatory prepayment requirement, the principal payment of the Notes will be applied to: (1) the 2023 Notes until paid in full; (2) then to the 2022 Bridge Notes until paid in full; (3) then to the Delayed Draw Terms Notes until paid in full; and (4) then to the Senior Secured Notes. All borrowings under the Notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company secured by liens and guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries. The Notes provide for a default interest rate equal to the rate of interest in effect at the time of default plus 4.0%, along with other provision for acceleration of the Notes under certain conditions. The Notes provide for certain affirmative covenants, including certain financial reporting obligations.
