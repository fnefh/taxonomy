<p>The preparation of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>These interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K").</p>
<p>All significant intercompany transactions and accounts within the Company's consolidated businesses have been eliminated. Investments in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence generally exists when the Company owns an interest between 20% and 50%. Equity securities in which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% ownership interest) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either at fair value or using the measurement alternative method which is at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. All gains and losses on investments in equity securities are recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.</p>
<p>The Company's fiscal year ends on June 30 ("fiscal") of each year. Certain fiscal 2023 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.</p>

<p>Fair value is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market (a Level 1 measurement).</p>
<h2>Concentrations of Credit Risk</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.</p>
<p>Generally, the Company does not require collateral to secure receivables. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company's receivables. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 11% of the Company's receivables.</p>
<h2>NOTE 5. BORROWINGS</h2>
<p>Borrowings include senior notes (See Note 9-Borrowings in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "Public Debt - Senior Notes Issued"). In October 2023, the Company issued $1.25 billion of 6.500% senior notes due 2033. In addition, the Company is party to a credit agreement providing a $ 1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $150 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of June 2028 (See Note 9 -Borrowings in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "Revolving Credit Agreement"). As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, $1.25 billion of 4.030% senior notes due in January 2024 matured and were repaid in full.</p>
<h2>NOTE 6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY</h2>
<h2>Stock Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company can repurchase $ 7 billion of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), and Class B Common Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock") . The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.</p>
<p>In connection with the stock repurchase program, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement in February 2023, under which the Company paid a third-party financial institution $1 billion and received an initial delivery of approximately 22.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 80% of the shares expected to be repurchased under the ASR agreement, at a price of $ 35.54 per share, which was the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") closing share price of the Class A Common Stock on February 8, 2023. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement in August 2023, the Company received a final delivery of approximately 7.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock. The final number of</p>
<h2>FOX CORPORATION</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>shares purchased under the ASR agreement was determined using a price of $ 33.03 per share (the volume-weighted average market price of the Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq during the term of the ASR agreement less a discount). The Company accounted for the ASR agreement as two separate transactions. The initial delivery of Class A Common Stock was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date. The final settlement of Class A Common Stock was accounted for as a forward contract indexed to the Class A Common Stock and qualified as an equity transaction.</p>
<p>In total, the Company repurchased approximately 24 million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 500 million during the six months ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Repurchased shares are retired and reduce the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Company allocates the amount of the repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, the Company's remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $ 1.9 billion. Subs equent to December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 50 million.</p>

<h2>Awards Vested and Granted</h2>
<h2>Restricted Stock Units</h2>
<p>During the six months ended December 31, 2023 a nd 2022 , restricted stock units ("RSUs") with a value of a pproximately $1.9 million and $1.5 million vested, respectively, and RSUs with a value of approximately $2.0 million were granted in each period . The se RSUs generally vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period subject to participants' continued employment with the Company.</p>
<h2>Performance-Based Stock Options</h2>
<p>During the six months ended December 31, 2023 a nd 2022, the Company granted approximately 4 million performance-based stock options, in each period, which will vest in full at the end of a three-year performance period if the market condition is met, and have a term of seven years thereafter.</p>
<h2>NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<h2>Commitments</h2>
<p>The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ("firm commitments") to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The total firm commitments and future debt payments as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 were approximately $38 billion and $39 billion, respectively. The decrease from June 30, 2023 was primarily due to sports programming rights payments, partially offset by the issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in October 2023 (See Note 5Borrowings).</p>
<h2>Contingencies</h2>
<p>The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For the contingencies disclosed below for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, other than the accrual provided, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss.</p>
<h2>FOX News</h2>
<p>The Company's FOX News business and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex and race. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements or reserved for pending or future claims is material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. The amount of additional liability, if any, that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<h2>U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity</h2>
<p>In connection with the separation of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. ("21CF") and News Corporation in June 2013 (the "21CF News Corporation Separation"), 21CF agreed to indemnify News Corporation, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the 21CF News Corporation Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials that</p>
<h2>FOX CORPORATION</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>occurred at subsidiaries of News Corporation before the 21CF News Corporation Separation, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with News Corporation (the "U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity"). In accordance with the Separation Agreement (as defined in Note 1-Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction"), the Company assumed certain costs and liabilities related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity. The liability recorded in the Balance Sheets related to the indemnity was approximately $115 million as of June 30, 2023 and approximately $ 90 million as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Defamation and Disparagement Claims</h2>
<p>From time to time, the Company and its news businesses, including FOX News Media and the FOX Television Stations, and their employees are subject to lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement. These include lawsuits filed by Smartmatic USA Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Smartmatic") in February 2021 seeking $2.7 billion in damages and Dominion Voting Systems, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Dominion") in March 2021 seeking $1.6 billion in damages. On March 31, 2023, the court in the Dominion case issued its rulings on summary judgment motions that were unfavorable to the Company. Following these rulings, on April 18, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Fox News Network, LLC, entered into a Release and Settlement Agreement with Dominion pursuant to which the parties agreed to resolve the lawsuits among them. The Company paid an aggregate of approximately $800 million to settle this and a related lawsuit in April 2023.</p>
<p>The Company continues to believe the Smartmatic and other pending lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously, including through any appeals. Discovery in the Smartmatic case, including depositions and expert discovery, remains ongoing, and summary judgment and other key motions will follow. At this time, a trial in the Smartmatic lawsuit is not expected to commence until 2025. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of these matters and has determined that a loss in the Smartmatic case is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<p>On April 11, 2023 and April 20, 2023, stockholders of the Company filed derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain directors of the Company under the captions Schwarz v. Murdoch et al., C.A. No. 2023-0418 (Del. Ch.) and Greenberg et al. v. Murdoch et al., C.A. No. 2023-0440 (Del. Ch.) . The Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated the lawsuits into one matter captioned In re Fox Corporation Deriv. Litig., C.A. No. 2023-0418 (Del.Ch.) . Two additional derivative lawsuits were subsequently filed by the Company's stockholders in the same court on September 12, 2023 against certain directors and officers of the Company and are part of the consolidated lawsuit. Each of the lawsuits names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaints allege that certain directors and officers, as applicable, breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company's news channel to air allegations regarding election fraud in connection with the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, which resulted in significant defamation litigation. The plaintiffs seek orders awarding damages in favor of the Company; directing the Company to reform and improve its policies and procedures; and awarding the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously contest the lawsuit.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>The Company's operations are subject to tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. Each member of the 21CF consolidated group, which includes 21CF, the Company (prior to the Transaction (as defined in Note 1-Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction")) and 21CF's other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income and, in certain jurisdictions, state tax liabilities of each</p>
<h2>FOX CORPORATION</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>other member of the consolidated group. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21CF consolidated group. The tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the Separation (as defined in Note 1Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction") requires 21CF and/or The Walt Disney Company to indemnify the Company for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the Internal Revenue Service in amounts that the Company cannot quantify.</p>
<h2>NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS</h2>
<p>The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. The net periodic benefit cost was $14 million and $16 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 27 million and $32 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.</p>
<h2>NOTE 10. SEGMENT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>The Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Cable Network Programming , which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies, virtual multi-channel video programming distributors and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S.</li>
<li>· Television , which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising supported videoon-demand service Tubi, 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. Eighteen of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network, 10 are affiliated with MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties.</li>
<li>· Other, Corporate and Eliminations , which principally consists of the FOX Studio Lot, Credible, corporate overhead costs and intracompany eliminations. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.</p>
<p>Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company's businesses.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h2>For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022</h2>
<p>The Company's revenues decreased 8% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to lower advertising revenue, partially offset by higher affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to the absence of the Fédération International de Football Association ("FIFA") Men's World Cup and lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations principally due to the absence of the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Also contributing to this decrease was lower pricing in the direct response</p>
<p>marketplace, lower ratings and higher preemptions associated with breaking news coverage at FOX News Media, partially offset by continued growth at Tubi. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue principally due to renewals of college sports contracts, partially offset by lower content revenues at the entertainment production companies principally as a result of industry guild labor disputes.</p>
<p>Operating expenses decreased 4% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower entertainment and sports programming rights amortization and production costs principally due to fewer hours of original scripted programming as compared to the prior year period as a result of industry guild labor disputes and the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup , partially offset by the renewed National Football League ("NFL") contract.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower employee related costs and lower legal costs at FOX News Media.</p>
<h2>For the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022</h2>
<p>The Company's revenues decreased 5% for the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to lower advertising revenue, partially offset by higher affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily attributable to the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup , lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations principally due to the absence of the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections, and lower pricing in the direct response marketplace and lower ratings at FOX News Media. Partially offsetting this decrease was continued growth at Tubi and the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup . The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue principally due to renewals of college sports contracts, partially offset by lower content revenues at the entertainment production companies principally as a result of industry guild labor disputes.</p>
<p>Operating expenses increased 1% for the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs principally due to the renewed NFL contract and the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup , partially offset by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup in the current year. Also partially offsetting this increase was lower entertainment programming rights amortization and production costs principally due to fewer hours of original scripted programming as compared to the prior year period as a result of industry guild labor disputes.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% for the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower legal costs at FOX News Media.</p>
<p>Interest expense, net -Interest expense, net increased 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in October 2023 (See Note 5-Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements). Interest expense, net decreased 11% for the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, as the increase in interest expense due to the issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in October 2023 was more than offset by higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates.</p>

<p>Income tax expense -The Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate $_{for the }$three and six months ended December 31, 2023 of 12% and 23%, respectively, was different than the $_{statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state tax law changes.}$</p>
<p>The Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 $_{ w}$as higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items$_{.}$</p>
<p>Net income -Net income decreased 64% and 43% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower Segment EBITDA (as defined below) and the change in fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities, partially offset by lower expenses for income tax and, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity (See Note 11-Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "Other, net").</p>
<h2>Segment Analysis</h2>
<p>The Company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.</p>
<p>Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company's businesses.</p>
<p>The following tables set forth the Company's Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the three and six months ended December 31, 2022:</p>

<h2>For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022</h2>
<p>Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased 2% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to higher affiliate fee and other revenues, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Affiliate fee revenue increased as higher average rates per subscriber were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower pricing in the direct response marketplace, lower ratings and higher preemptions associated with breaking news coverage at FOX News Media. Also contributing to this decrease was the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup at the national sports networks in the current year. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue principally due to renewals of college sports contracts and international soccer rights.</p>
<p>Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased 60% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to the revenue increases noted above and lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, led by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup in the current year, and lower programming and production costs at FOX News Media. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower legal costs at FOX News Media.</p>

<h2>For the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022</h2>
<p>Revenues at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include revenues generated by Credible and the operation of the FOX Studio Lot for third parties. Operating expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees and the costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher employee related costs as a result of the transition and separation of a named executive officer of the Company.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.</p>
<p>Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.</p>

<p>There have been no material changes in the market risks reported in the 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<h2>(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<h2>(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II</h2>
<h2>ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p>See Note 8-Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of FOX under the heading "Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company's legal proceedings.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the section titled "Risk Factors" in (i) the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on August 11, 2023, and (ii) the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on November 2, 2023, except as set forth below:</p>
<h2>The Company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, programming and other assets and investments.</h2>
<p>The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as the prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other long-lived assets. Any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of our programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. The Company holds investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities. These investments are recorded either at fair value and measured on a recurring basis based on quoted prices in active markets or on a non-recurring basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. A downward revision in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, programming rights, investments or long-lived assets could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Any such charge could be material to the Company's reported net earnings in a given reporting period.</p>
