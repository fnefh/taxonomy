## FOX CORPORATION

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Fox Corporation ("FOX" or the "Company") is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments: Cable Network Programming, Television and Other, Corporate and Eliminations.

The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of FOX have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

The preparation of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates.

These interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K").

All significant intercompany transactions and accounts within the Company's consolidated businesses have been eliminated. Investments in and advances to entities or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence generally exists when the Company owns an interest between 20% and 50%. Equity securities in which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% ownership interest) with readily determinable fair values are accounted for at fair value based on quoted market prices. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are accounted for either at fair value or using the measurement alternative method which is at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. All gains and losses on investments in equity securities are recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company's fiscal year ends on June 30 ("fiscal") of each year. Certain fiscal 2023 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.

The unaudited and audited consolidated financial statements are referred to as the "Financial Statements" herein. The unaudited consolidated statements of operations are referred to as the "Statements of Operations" herein. The unaudited and audited consolidated balance sheets are referred to as the "Balance Sheets" herein.

## NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

The Company's acquisitions support the Company's strategy to strengthen its core brands, grow its digital businesses and selectively enhance production capabilities for its digital and linear platforms. During the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company made no acquisitions.

On January 12, 2024, the United Football League (the "UFL") was launched as a professional spring football league that combines the legacy operations of the United States Football League (the "USFL"), a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of FOX, and XFL, a third-party company. In connection with the launch of the UFL, the Company deconsolidated the operations of USFL and contributed the USFL net assets to the UFL. As consideration for the net assets contributed, the Company received an ownership interest in the UFL which was initially recorded at fair value. The equity method investment is included in Other non-current assets

in the Balance Sheets. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $ 170 million in Non-operating other, net in the Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 (See Note 11-Additional Financial Information under the heading "NonOperating Other, net"). The Company owns approximately 42% of the UFL.

On February 6, 2024, FOX announced that it would enter into a joint venture with ESPN, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and Warner Bros. Discovery to form a digital distribution platform focused on sports. Each company is expected to own one-third of the joint venture, have equal board representation and license their sports networks to the joint venture on a non-exclusive basis. The subscription-based streaming service is expected to launch in the fall of 2024.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of unamortized programming and production costs, included within Inventories, net in the Balance Sheets, using expected future cash flows. The Company has determined that its unamortized production costs related to certain television series are not recoverable and therefore recognized a write-down at the Television segment of approximately $30 million and $10 million which was recorded in Operating expenses in the Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE

Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which distinguishes market participant assumptions into the following categories: (i) inputs that are quoted prices in active markets ("Level 1"); (ii) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ("Level 2"); and (iii) inputs that require the entity to use its own assumptions about market participant assumptions ("Level 3").

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments exclusive of borrowings, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and investments accounted for using the measurement alternative method, approximates fair value.

|                | As of March 31, 2024   | As of June 30, 2023   |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
|                | (in millions)          | (in millions)         |
| Borrowings     |                        |                       |
| Fair value     | $ 7,057                | $ 6,895               |
| Carrying value | $ 7,196                | $ 7,210               |

Fair value is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market (a Level 1 measurement).

## Concentrations of Credit Risk

Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.

Generally, the Company does not require collateral to secure receivables. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company's receivables. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 11% of the Company's receivables.

## NOTE 5. BORROWINGS

## NOTE 6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

## Stock Repurchase Program

The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company can repurchase $ 7 billion of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), and Class B Common Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock") . The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.

In connection with the stock repurchase program, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement in February 2023, under which the Company paid a third-party financial institution $1 billion and received an initial delivery of approximately 22.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 80% of the shares expected to be repurchased under the ASR agreement, at a price of $ 35.54 per share, which was the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") closing share price of the Class A Common Stock on February 8, 2023. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement in August 2023, the Company received a final delivery of approximately 7.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock. The final number of shares purchased under the ASR agreement was determined using a price of $33.03 per share (the volume-

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

weighted average market price of the Class A Common Stock on Nasdaq during the term of the ASR agreement less a discount). The Company accounted for the ASR agreement as two separate transactions. The initial delivery of Class A Common Stock was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date. The final settlement of Class A Common Stock was accounted for as a forward contract indexed to the Class A Common Stock and qualified as an equity transaction.

In total, the Company repurchased approximately 32 million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 750 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2024.

Repurchased shares are retired and reduce the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Company allocates the amount of the repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company's remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $ 1.65 billion. Subs equent to March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $ 50 million.

presented if their inclusion would have been antidilutive, and, for those shares that are contingently issuable, all necessary conditions have not been satisfied for the periods presented.

## Awards Vested and Granted

## Restricted Stock Units

During the nine months ended March 31, 2024 a nd 2023 , approximately 1.9 million and 1.5 million restricted stock units ("RSUs") vested, respectively, and approximately 2.0 million RSUs were granted in each period.

## NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## Commitments

The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ("firm commitments") to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The total firm commitments and future debt payments as of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, remained consistent at approximately $39 billion.

## Contingencies

The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For the contingencies disclosed below for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, other than the accrual provided, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss.

## FOX News

The Company's FOX News business and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex and race. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements or reserved for pending or future claims is material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. The amount of additional liability, if any, that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

## U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity

In connection with the separation of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. ("21CF") and News Corporation in June 2013 (the "21CF News Corporation Separation"), 21CF agreed to indemnify News Corporation, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the 21CF News Corporation Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials that occurred at subsidiaries of News Corporation before the 21CF News Corporation Separation, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees,

## FOX CORPORATION

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, codefendants with News Corporation (the "U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity"). In accordance with the Separation Agreement (as defined in Note 1Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction"), the Company assumed certain costs and liabilities related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity. The liability recorded in the Balance Sheets related to the indemnity was approximately $115 million as of June 30, 2023 and approximately $70 million as of March 31, 2024.

## Defamation and Disparagement Claims

From time to time, the Company and its news businesses, including FOX News Media and the FOX Television Stations, and their employees are subject to lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement. These include lawsuits filed by Smartmatic USA Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Smartmatic") in February 2021 seeking $2.7 billion in damages and Dominion Voting Systems, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Dominion") in March 2021 seeking $1.6 billion in damages. On March 31, 2023, the court in the Dominion case issued its rulings on summary judgment motions that were unfavorable to the Company. Following these rulings, on April 18, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Fox News Network, LLC, entered into a Release and Settlement Agreement with Dominion pursuant to which the parties agreed to resolve the lawsuits among them. The Company paid an aggregate of approximately $800 million to settle this and a related lawsuit in April 2023.

The Company continues to believe the Smartmatic and other pending lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously, including through any appeals. Discovery in the Smartmatic case, including depositions and expert discovery, remains ongoing, and summary judgment and other key motions will follow. At this time, a trial in the Smartmatic lawsuit is not expected to commence until 2025. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of these matters and has determined that a loss in the Smartmatic case is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On April 11, 2023 and April 20, 2023, stockholders of the Company filed derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain directors of the Company under the captions Schwarz v. Murdoch et al., C.A. No. 2023-0418 (Del. Ch.) and Greenberg et al. v. Murdoch et al., C.A. No. 2023-0440 (Del. Ch.) . The Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated the lawsuits into one matter captioned In re Fox Corporation Deriv. Litig., C.A. No. 2023-0418 (Del.Ch.) . Two additional derivative lawsuits were subsequently filed by the Company's stockholders in the same court on September 12, 2023 against certain directors and officers of the Company and are part of the consolidated lawsuit. Each of the lawsuits names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaints allege that certain directors and officers, as applicable, breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company's news channel to air allegations regarding election fraud in connection with the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, which resulted in significant defamation litigation. The plaintiffs seek orders awarding damages in favor of the Company; directing the Company to reform and improve its policies and procedures; and awarding the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously contest the lawsuit.

## Actions and Claims Arising from Alleged Misuse of Personal Information

Tubi, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Tubi"), is from time to time a party to actions and arbitration claims arising from its alleged misuse of personal information. In June 2023, a putative class action lawsuit titled Campos v. Tubi was filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging that Tubi shared viewer information with third parties in violation of the privacy protection provisions of the federal Video Privacy Protection Act. In February 2024, the District Court denied Tubi's motion to compel arbitration and motion to dismiss, and Tubi is appealing those rulings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Tubi and the Company intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter and has determined that a loss in the case is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of

## FOX CORPORATION

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

this pending matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

## Other

The Company's operations are subject to tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. Each member of the 21CF consolidated group, which includes 21CF, the Company (prior to the Transaction (as defined in Note 1-Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction")) and 21CF's other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income and, in certain jurisdictions, state tax liabilities of each other member of the consolidated group. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21CF consolidated group. The tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the Separation (as defined in Note 1-Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading "The Transaction") requires 21CF and/or The Walt Disney Company to indemnify the Company for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the Internal Revenue Service in amounts that the Company cannot quantify.

## NOTE 9. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. The net periodic benefit cost was $13 million and $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $ 40 million and $48 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company's businesses.

The following tables set forth the Company's Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

## Overview

## For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

The Company's revenues decreased $637 million or 16% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to lower advertising and other revenues, partially offset by higher affiliate fee revenue. The increase of $81 million or 4% in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to the approximately $230 million impact of higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, partially offset by the approximately $140 million impact of a lower average number of subscribers across almost all networks. The decrease of $640 million or 34% in advertising revenue was primarily due to the absence of the February 2023 broadcast of Super Bowl LVII and fewer National Football League ("NFL") games. The decrease of $78 million or 22% in other revenues was primarily due to the timing of college sports sublicensing revenue.

Operating expenses decreased $677 million or 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the impact of the absence of the February 2023 broadcast of Super Bowl LVII , fewer NFL games and the timing of sports programming rights amortization at the national sports networks.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $18 million or 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower legal costs at FOX News Media.

## For the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

The Company's revenues decreased $993 million or 8% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to lower advertising and other revenues, partially offset by higher affiliate fee revenue. The increase of $185 million or 4% in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to the approximately $550 million impact of higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, partially offset by the approximately $330 million impact of a lower average number of subscribers across almost all networks. The decrease of $1.2 billion or 21% in advertising revenue was primarily due to the approximately $950 million impact of the absence of the fiscal 2023 broadcasts of Super Bowl LVII and the Fédération International de Football Association ("FIFA") Men's World Cup and fewer NFL playoff games. The remaining decrease of approximately $250 million was primarily related to lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations principally due to the comparison with the November 2022 U.S. midterm elections in the prior year and lower ratings at FOX News Media and the FOX Network, partially offset by continued growth at Tubi and the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup at the national sports networks in the current year. The decrease of $17 million or 2% in other revenues was primarily due to lower content revenues principally due to the impact of the industry guild labor disputes in 2023, partially offset by higher sports sublicensing revenue principally due to renewals of college sports contracts.

Operating expenses decreased $606 million or 8% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the approximately $460 million impact of lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs principally due to the absence of the fiscal 2023 broadcasts of Super Bowl LVII and the FIFA Men's World Cup partially offset by the renewed NFL contract. The remaining decrease was principally due to lower entertainment programming rights and production costs largely due to fewer hours of original scripted programming as compared to the prior year period as a result of the impact of the industry guild labor disputes in 2023.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $41 million or 3% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower legal costs at FOX News Media and lower employee related costs.

Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters -See Note 11-Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "Restructuring, Impairment and Other Corporate Matters."

Interest expense, net - Interest expense, net decreased $14 million or 8% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, as the increase in interest expense due to the issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes in October 2023 (See Note 5Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements) was more than offset by higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates.

Non-operating other, net -See Note 11-Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "NonOperating Other, net."

Income tax (expense) benefit -The Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 of 27% and 25%, respectively, was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes.

The Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 was different than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and the impact of other permanent items.

Net income (loss) -The Company recorded net income of $704 million and $1.2 billion for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $50 million and net income of $884 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to the absence of the fiscal 2023 legal settlement costs at FOX News Media (See Note 11-Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "Restructuring, Impairment and Other Corporate Matters") and a gain on a contribution of assets (See Note 11-Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "Non-Operating Other, net"), partially offset by higher provision for income tax, the net change in fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities and, for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, lower Segment EBITDA (as defined below).

## Segment Analysis

The Company's operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.

Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company's businesses.

The following tables set forth the Company's Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023:

## For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment decreased $98 million or 6% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, due to lower advertising and other revenues, partially offset by higher affiliate fee revenue. Affiliate fee revenue increased $11 million or 1% as higher average rates per subscriber were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of subscribers. The decrease of $20 million or 6% in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower digital advertising revenue and moderating direct response pricing declines at FOX News Media. Also contributing to this decrease was the absence of the March 2023 broadcast of the World Baseball Classic at the national sports networks. The decrease of $89 million or 55% in other revenues was primarily due to the timing of college sports sublicensing revenue.

Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased $27 million or 3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, as the revenue decreases noted above were more than offset by lower expenses.

## For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023

Revenues at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include revenues generated by Credible and the operation of the FOX Studio Lot for third parties. Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees and the costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 increased, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher employee related costs as a result of the transition and separation of a named executive officer of the Company.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense.

Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both

operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).

Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023:

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

## Current Financial Condition

The Company has approximately $3.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 5-Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements). The Company also has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. As of March 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants.

The principal uses of cash that affect the Company's liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for sports and entertainment programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the Company's programming; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; income taxes, interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; legal settlements; and stock repurchases.

The Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company's securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.

## Sources and Uses of Cash

Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions):

| For the nine months ended March 31,       |   2024 | 2023   |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Net cash provided by operating activities |    941 | 1,307  |

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, was primarily due to lower Segment EBITDA and lower NFL receipts due to the absence of Super Bowl LVII, partially offset by lower entertainment programming costs.

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions):

| For the nine months ended March 31,   | 2024   | 2023   |
|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Net cash used in investing activities | (324)  | (318)  |

Net cash used in investing activities remained relatively consistent during the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher investments in equity securities partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in millions):

| For the nine months ended March 31,   | 2024    | 2023      |
|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Net cash used in financing activities | (1,098) | $ (2,043) |

The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2023, was primarily due to lower activity under the stock repurchase program and the net impact of the October 2023 issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes and the $1.25 billion repayment of senior notes that matured in January 2024 (See Note 5-Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).

## Stock Repurchase Program

See Note 6-Stockholders' Equity to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading "Stock Repurchase Program."

## Debt Instruments

Borrowings include senior notes. In January 2024, $1.25 billion of 4.030% senior notes matured and were repaid in full (See Note 5-Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).

## Ratings of the Senior Notes

The following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings as of March 31, 2024:

| Rating Agency     | Senior Debt   | Outlook   |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Moody's           | Baa2          | Stable    |
| Standard & Poor's | BBB           | Stable    |

The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
