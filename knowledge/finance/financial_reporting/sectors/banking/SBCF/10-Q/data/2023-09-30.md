SEACOAST BANKING CORPORATION OF FLORIDA AND SUBSIDIARIES
--------------------------------------------------------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
------------------------------

Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida and its subsidiaries (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023, or any other period. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Use of Estimates: The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are wellcontrolled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management's estimates include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, acquisition accounting and purchased loans, intangible assets and impairment testing, other fair value measurements, and contingent liabilities.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement
----------------------------------------

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-02, "Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures." ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") in ASC 310-40, Receivables Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, and introduces new disclosures related to modifications with borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulties. ASU 2022-02 also requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables held at amortized cost. Upon adoption, the Company eliminated the separate allowance for credit loss estimation process for loans classified as TDRs. The adoption did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the loans modified for borrowers in financial difficulty and for the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination, see "Note 4 - Loans."

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2022-01, "Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method." ASU 2022-01 permits the designation of multiple hedging relationships on a single closed portfolio. The guidance also expands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable assets, specifies eligible hedging instruments in a single-layer hedge, and provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. The adoption did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information on fair value hedges, see "Note 6 Derivatives."

Note 2 - Earnings per Share
---------------------------

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,368,968 options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, 1,505 options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock were anti-dilutive.

| Net income per share | $ 0.37 | $ 0.47 | $ 0.89 | $ 1.33 |

Net income has not been allocated to unvested restricted stock awards that are participating securities because the amounts that would be allocated are not material to net income per share of common stock. Unvested restricted stock awards that are participating securities represent less than one percent of all of the outstanding shares of common stock for each of the periods presented.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had unrealized losses of $266.7 million on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by government-sponsored entities having a fair value of $1.3 billion. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. The implied government guarantee of principal and interest payments and the high credit rating of the portfolio provide a sufficient basis for the current expectation that there is no risk of loss if default were to occur. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, on September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had $13.9 million of unrealized losses on private-label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations having a fair value of $124.2 million. The securities have a weighted average credit support of 22%. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had $3.5 million of unrealized losses in floating rate collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") having a fair value of $304.2 million. CLOs are special purpose vehicles and those in which the Company has invested are nearly all first-lien, broadly syndicated corporate loans across a diversified band of industries while providing support to senior tranche investors. As of September 30, 2023, all positions held by the Company are in AAA and AA tranches, with weighted average credit support of 38% and 25%, respectively. The Company evaluates the securities for potential credit losses by modeling expected loan-level defaults, recoveries, and prepayments for each CLO security. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had $2.1 million of unrealized losses on municipal securities having a fair value of $19.7 million. These securities are highly rated issuances of state or local municipalities, all of which are continuing to make timely contractual payments. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. As a result, as of September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.

All held-to-maturity ("HTM") debt securities are issued by government-sponsored entities, which are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. While the potential for default on these securities may be greater than zero, the long history with no credit losses, the implied government guarantee of principal and interest payments, and the high credit rating of the HTM portfolio provide sufficient basis for the current expectation that there is no risk of loss if default were to occur. As a result, as of September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Included in Other Assets at September 30, 2023 is $70.5 million of Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock stated at par value. The Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances which may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these cost method investment securities. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale ("AFS") and HTM debt securities of $8.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023, and $7.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022, is included in Other Assets. Also included in Other Assets are investments in CRA-qualified mutual funds carried at fair value of $13.1 million and $8.2 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The Company holds 11,330 shares of Visa Class B stock, which, following the resolution of Visa litigation, will be converted to Visa Class A shares. Under the current conversion ratio that became effective September 28, 2023, the Company would receive 1.5875 shares of Class A stock for each share of Class B stock for a total of 17,986 shares of Visa Class A stock. The ownership of Visa stock is related to prior ownership in Visa's network while Visa operated as a cooperative, and is recorded on the Company's financial records at a zero basis.

Note 4 - Loans
--------------

Loans held for investment are categorized into the following segments:

* · Construction and land development: Loans are extended to both commercial and consumer customers which are collateralized by and for the purpose of funding land development and construction projects, including 1-4 family residential construction, multi-family property, and non-farm residential property where the primary source of repayment is from proceeds of the sale, refinancing or permanent financing of the property.
* · Commercial real estate - owner occupied: Loans are extended to commercial customers for the purpose of acquiring real estate to be occupied by the borrower's business. These loans are collateralized by the subject property and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the performance of the company occupying the property.
* · Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied: Loans are extended to commercial customers for the purpose of acquiring commercial property where occupancy by the borrower is not their primary intent. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans, collateralized by the subject property, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on rental income from the successful operation of the property.
* · Residential real estate: Loans are extended to consumer customers and collateralized primarily by 1-4 family residential properties and include fixed and variable rate mortgages, home equity mortgages, and home equity lines of credit. Loans are primarily written based on conventional loan agency guidelines, including loans that exceed agency value limitations. Sources of repayment are largely dependent on the occupant of the residential property.
* · Commercial and financial: Loans are extended to commercial customers. The purpose of the loans can be working capital, physical asset expansion, asset acquisition, or other business purposes. Loans may be collateralized by assets owned by the borrower or the borrower's business. Commercial loans are based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the borrower's business and secondarily on the capacity of credit enhancements, guarantees, and underlying collateral provided by the borrower.
* · Consumer: Loans are extended to consumer customers. The segment includes both installment loans and lines of credit which may be collateralized or noncollateralized.

The following tables present net loan balances by segment as of:

All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest subsequently received on such loans is accounted for under the cost-recovery method, whereby interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are reasonably assured. The Company recognized $0.4 million and $0.8 million in interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company recognized $0.2 million and $1.4 million in interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

Collateral-Dependent Loans
--------------------------

Loans are considered collateral-dependent when the repayment, based on the Company's assessment as of the reporting date, is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. In the third quarter of 2023, $19.9 million of loans moved from individually evaluated to collectively evaluated as a result of a change in methodology for evaluating loans individually.These loans are no longer reflected as collateral-dependent loans. The following table presents collateral-dependent loans as of:

Loans by Risk Rating
--------------------

The Company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of identifying problem and potential problem loans. The following classifications are used to categorize loans under the internal classification system:

* · Pass: Loans that are not problem loans or potential problem loans are considered to be pass-rated.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

* · Special Mention: Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in the Substandard or Doubtful categories, but possess weaknesses that deserve management's close attention are deemed to be Special Mention.
* · Substandard: Loans with the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
* · Substandard Impaired: Loans typically placed on nonaccrual and considered to be collateral-dependent.
* · Doubtful: Loans that have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness present makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The principal balance of loans classified as doubtful is likely to be charged off.

The following tables present the risk rating of loans and year-to-date gross charge offs by year of origination as of:

Troubled Borrower Modifications
-------------------------------

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 which includes disclosure requirements related to certain modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which the Company refers to as troubled borrower modifications ("TBMs"). TBMs are typically in the form of an interest rate reduction, an extension of the amortization period, and/or converting the loan to interest only for a limited period of time. In addition to the change in payment terms, the Company seeks to obtain additional collateral and/or guarantors to provide additional support for the loan. The Company does not typically provide forgiveness of principal as a modification.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company had eight loans classified as TBMs totaling $2.2 million, which is considered immaterial. To the extent there are additional modifications in subsequent periods, the Company will disclose additional information about the nature of the modifications, the financial effect of the modifications, and payment defaults of TBMs in the 12 months prior to default, among any other relevant disclosures.

Management establishes the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Forecast data is sourced from Moody's Analytics ("Moody's"), a firm widely recognized for its research, analysis, and economic forecasts. The forecasts of future economic conditions are over a period that has been deemed reasonable and supportable, and in segments where it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans.

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company utilized a blend of Moody's most recent "U.S. Macroeconomic Outlook Baseline" and "Alternative Scenario 3 Downside 90th Percentile" scenarios and considered the uncertainty associated with the assumptions in both scenarios, including continued actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to monetary policy and interest rates and the potential impact of those actions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the magnitude of the resulting market disruption, the potential impact of persistently high inflation on economic growth and expectations around a recession occurring over the next 12 to 24 months. Outcomes in any or all of these factors could differ from the scenarios identified above, and the Company incorporated qualitative considerations reflecting the risk of uncertain economic conditions, and for additional dimensions of risk not captured in the quantitative model.

The following section discusses changes in the level of the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

In the Construction and Land Development segment, the increase in the allowance is due to an increase in expected credit losses driven by changes in collateral type and estimated collateral values. In this segment, the primary source of repayment is typically from proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the underlying property; therefore, industry and collateral type and estimated collateral values are among the relevant factors in assessing expected losses.

In the Commercial Real Estate - Owner-Occupied segment, the allowance decreased from the prior quarter due to slight improvements in the forecast for macroeconomic factors such as the unemployment rate and BBB credit spread. Risk characteristics include but are not limited to, collateral type, note structure and loan seasoning.

In the Commercial Real Estate - Non Owner-Occupied segment, the decrease in the allowance is primarily attributed to lower loan balances. Repayment is often dependent upon rental income from the successful operation of the underlying property. Loan performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions or conditions specific to the real estate market, including property types. Collateral type, note structure, and loan seasoning are among the risk characteristics analyzed for this segment.

The Residential Real Estate segment includes first mortgages secured by residential property, and home equity lines of credit. The increase in the allowance is due to an increase in loan balances and an increase in expected credit losses. Risk characteristics considered for this segment include, but are not limited to, borrower FICO score, lien position, loan to value ratios, and loan seasoning.

In the Commercial and Financial segment, borrowers are primarily small to medium sized professional firms and other businesses, and loans are generally supported by projected cash flows of the business, collateralized by business assets, and/or guaranteed by the business owners. The decrease in reserves is primarily attributed to a complete charge-off of an $11.3 million acquired loan that was fully reserved, partially offset by an increase in expected credit losses on commercial and industrial

unsecured loans. Industry, collateral type, estimated collateral values, and loan seasoning are among the relevant factors in assessing expected losses.

Consumer loans include installment and revolving lines, loans for automobiles, boats, and other personal or family purposes. Risk characteristics considered for this segment include, but are not limited to, collateral type, loan to value ratios, loan seasoning and FICO score. The decrease in the allowance is primarily due to a decrease in loan balances.

The allowance for credit losses is composed of specific allowances for loans individually evaluated and general allowances for loans grouped into loan pools based on similar characteristics, which are collectively evaluated. In the third quarter of 2023, $19.9 million of loans moved from individually evaluated to collectively evaluated as a result of a change in methodology for evaluating loans individually. The impact on the reserve was not material. The Company's loan portfolio and related allowance at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are shown in the following tables:

Note 6 - Derivatives
--------------------

Back-to-Back Swaps
------------------

The Company offers interest rate swaps when requested by customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. Upon entering into these swaps, the Company enters into offsetting positions with counterparties in order to minimize the interest rate risk. These back-to-back swaps qualify as freestanding financial derivatives with the fair values reported in Other Assets and Other Liabilities. The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under the arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes. Gains and losses on these back-to-back swaps, which offset, are recorded through noninterest income. No net gains or losses have been recognized to date on these instruments. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps had an aggregate notional value of $505.7 million, with a fair value of $37.4 million recorded in Other Assets and Other Liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate swaps had an aggregate notional value of $312.8 million, with a fair value of $23.1 million recorded in Other Assets and Other Liabilities. The weighted average maturity was 6.0 years at September 30, 2023 and6.7 years at December 31, 2022.

Interest Rate Floors Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
---------------------------------------------------

The Company has entered into interest rate floor contracts to mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows due to changes in interest rates on certain segments of its variable-rate loans. During 2020, the Company entered into two interest rate floor contracts, each with a notional amount of $150.0 million, maturing in October 2023 and November 2023, respectively. The Company considers these derivatives to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates and has designated them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income. Amortization of the premium paid on cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings over the term of the hedge in the same caption as the hedged item. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the interest rate floors had a nominal fair value. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized nominal amounts through other comprehensive income, and reclassified $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into interest income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a loss through other comprehensive income of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and reclassified $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company expects to reclassify $0.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest income related to these agreements.

Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Fair Value Hedges
---------------------------------------------------

In April 2023, the Company entered into two interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the AFS portfolio due to changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") interest rate. Each fair value hedge utilizes the portfolio layer method hedge designation type for a notional amount of $200 million, maturing April 2025. The Company considers these derivatives to be highly effective at offsetting changes in interest rates and will assess the effectiveness on a monthly basis. Therefore, changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of these derivative contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income. These derivative instruments are primarily for risk management purposes. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps had a notional value of $400 million with a fair value of $6.9 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized gains through other comprehensive income of $0.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, and reclassified a loss of $5.4 thousand and gain of $0.1 million, respectively, out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into interest income.

Available-for-sale debt securities : Level 1 securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities. Other securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of a security is determined based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available.

The Company reviews the prices supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. The fair value of collateralized loan obligations is determined from broker quotes. From time to time, the Company will validate, on a sample basis, prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from other brokers and third-party sources or derived using internal models.

Derivative financial instruments : The Company offers interest rate swaps to certain loan customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. The Company originates a variable rate loan and enters into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap with the customer. The Company also enters into an offsetting swap with a correspondent bank. These back-to-back agreements are intended to offset each other and allow the Company to originate a variable rate loan, while

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

providing a contract for fixed interest payments for the customer. The fair value of these derivatives is based on a discounted cash flow approach. Due to the observable nature of the inputs used in deriving the fair value of these derivative contracts, the valuation of interest rate swaps is classified as Level 2. Other derivatives are also classified within Level 2. The fair values of these instruments are based upon the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the instruments, taking into account current interest rates and, when appropriate, the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.

Loans held for sale : Fair values are based upon estimated values to be received from independent third party purchasers. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that the fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. Fair market value changes occur due to changes in interest rates, the borrower's credit, the secondary loan market and the market for a borrower's debt. Interest income is recorded based on the contractual terms of the loan and in accordance with the Company's policy on loans held for investment. None of the loans were 90 days or more past due or on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The aggregate fair value and contractual balance of loans held for sale as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is as follows:

Table of Contents

| (In thousands) | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggregate fair value | 2,979 | 3,151 |
| Contractual balance | 2,846 | 3,071 |
| Excess | 133 | 80 |

Loans : Loans carried at fair value consist of collateral-dependent real estate loans. Fair value is based on recent real estate appraisals and evaluations may use either a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches, such as comparative sales, cost and/or income approach. A significant unobservable input in the income approach is the estimated capitalization rate for a given piece of collateral. At September 30, 2023, capitalization rates utilized to determine fair value of the underlying collateral averaged approximately 6.9%. Adjustments to comparable sales may be made by an appraiser to reflect local market conditions or other economic factors and may result in changes in the fair value of an asset over time. If such adjustments are made, the fair value of these loans is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral-dependent loans measured at fair value totaled $11.5 million with a specific reserve of $1.0 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $10.2 million with a specific reserve of $2.9 million at December 31, 2022.

For loans classified as Level 3, changes included loan additions of $3.2 million offset by $6.3 million in paydowns and charge-offs and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Other real estate owned : When appraisals are used to determine fair value and the appraisals are based on a market approach, the fair value of other real estate owned ("OREO") is classified as a Level 2 input. When the fair value of OREO is based on appraisals which require significant adjustments to market-based valuation inputs or apply an income approach based on unobservable cash flows, the fair value of OREO is classified as Level 3.

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally coincides with the Company's monthly and/or quarterly valuation process. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no such transfers.

The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's other financial instruments that were not disclosed previously in the balance sheet and for which carrying amount is not fair value as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is as follows:

The short maturity of Seacoast's assets and liabilities results in having a significant number of financial instruments whose fair value equals or closely approximates carrying value. Such financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions: cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with other banks, short-term FHLB borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Held-to-maturity debt securities : These debt securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of a security is determined based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available.

The Company reviews the prices supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. From time to time, the Company will validate, on a sample basis, prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from other brokers and third-party sources or derived using internal models.

Loans : Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial or mortgage. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable-rate interest terms as well as performing and nonperforming categories. The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated life including prepayment considerations, using estimated market discount rates that reflect the risks inherent in the loan. The fair value approach considers market-driven variables including credit related factors and reflects an "exit price" as defined in ASC Topic 820.

Deposit liabilities : The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for funding of similar remaining maturities.

Acquisition of Professional Holding Corp.
-----------------------------------------

On January 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Professional Holding Corp. ("Professional"). Simultaneously, upon completion of the merger of Professional and the Company, Professional Bank was merged with and into Seacoast Bank. Prior to the acquisition, Professional Bank operated nine branches across South Florida. The transaction further expands the Company's presence in the tri-county South Florida market, which includes Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, Florida's largest MSA and the 8 largest in the nation. The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Professional. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Professional shareholders received 0.8909 shares of Seacoast common stock for each share of Professional common stock held immediately prior to the merger, and Professional option holders received options to purchase Seacoast common stock, with the number of shares underlying each such option and the applicable exercise price adjusted using the same 0.8909 exchange ratio. th

Determining fair values of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, core deposit intangibles, and deferred taxes, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values. The fair values initially assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and could change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as new information and circumstances relative to closing date fair values becomes known.

As part of the acquisition of Professional, options were granted to replace outstanding Professional options. These options were fully vested upon acquisition. The full value of the replacement options, $10.3 million, was associated with pre-combination service and was therefore included in the calculation of the total purchase consideration.

Acquisition of Business Bank of Florida, Corp.
----------------------------------------------

On January 3, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Business Bank of Florida, Corp., ("BBFC"). Simultaneously, upon completion of the merger of BBFC and the Company, BBFC's wholly owned subsidiary bank, Florida Business Bank, was merged with and into Seacoast Bank. Prior to the acquisition, Florida Business Bank operated one branch in Melbourne, Florida.

As a result of this acquisition, the Company expects to expand its customer base and leverage operating cost through economies of scale, and positively affect the Company's operating results.

The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of BBFC. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of BBFC common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.7997 of a share of Seacoast common stock.

The acquisition of BBFC was accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . The Company recognized goodwill of $8.0 million for this acquisition that is nondeductible for tax purposes. Determining fair values of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, core deposit intangibles, and deferred taxes, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values.

As part of the BBFC acquisition, options were granted to replace outstanding BBFC options. These options were fully vested upon acquisition. The full value of the replacement options, $0.5 million, was associated with pre-combination service and was therefore included in the calculation of the total purchase consideration.

Acquisition of Professional Holding Corp.
-----------------------------------------

("Professional"), parent company of Professional Bank, adding deposits of approximately $2.1 billion and loans of approximately $2.0 billion. Full integration and system conversion activities, including the consolidation of five branches in the South Florida market, were completed in June 2023.

Net Interest Income and Margin
------------------------------

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $119.3 million, a decrease of $7.7 million, or6%, compared to the second quarter of 2023, an d an increase of $31.0 million, or 35%, co mpared to the third quarter of 2022. The decrease from prior quarter reflects higher interest expense on deposits driven by higher rates and changes in product mix and was partially offset by higher interest income. The increase from prior year is primarily due to higher balances and higher yields on securities and loans, partially offset by the higher cost of deposits. Net interest margin (on a fully tax equivalent basis) was 3.57% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to 3.86% in the second quarter of 2023, and 3.67% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarter was driven by the continued effect of an inverted yield curve and rising deposit costs. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, securities yields increased 19 basis points to 3.32% and loan yields increased to 5.93% during the third quarter of 2023. The effect on net interest margin of accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans were increases of 44 basis points in the third quarter of 2023, 44 basis points in the second quarter of 2023, and 9 basis points in the third quarter of 2022. The cost of deposits was 1.79% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to 1.38% in the second quarter of 2023, and nine basis points in the third quarter of 2022. Notably impactful to deposit costs in the third quarter of 2023 was the Florida Bar Association's IOTA program changes, enacted in May, requiring financial institutions to pay interest on these accounts at a specified spread to an index. This contributed approximately five basis points to the increase in deposits costs in the third quarter of 2023. 1

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest margin (on a fully tax equivalent basis) was 3.91%, compared to 3.44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The yield on securities increased from 2.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to 3.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the yield on total loans increased from 4.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to 5.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, each reflecting the impact of the higher interest rate environment. The effect on net interest margin of purchase discounts on acquired loans was an increase of 47 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to an increase of 12 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The cost of deposits increased from seven basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to 1.33% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher cost of deposits during the year reflects the impact of the Professional acquisition and an increasingly competitive market for deposits. 1

Financial Condition
-------------------

Total assets as of September 30, 2023 were $14.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion, or 22%, from December 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of Professional on January 31, 2023, which added $2.7 billion in assets.

Securities
----------

Information related to yields, maturities, carrying values and fair value of the Company's debt securities is set forth in "Note 3 - Securities" of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had $1.8 billion in securities available-for-sale and $691.4 million in securities held-to-maturity. The Company's total debt securities portfolio decreased $85.9 million from December 31, 2022.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were $28.1 million of debt securities purchased, $167.1 million acquired through the acquisition of Professional and $212.2 million in paydowns and maturities over the same period. $22.1 million of the securities acquired from Professional were immediately sold with no gain or loss recognized.

Debt securities generally return principal and interest monthly. The modified duration of the available-for-sale portfolio at September 30, 2023 was 4.1, compared to 3.7 at December 31, 2022.

At September 30, 2023, available-for-sale securities had gross unrealized losses of $287.3 million and gross unrealized gains of $0.7 million, compared to gross unrealized losses of $248.7 million and gross unrealized gains of $1.1 million at December 31, 2022. The changes were the result of changes in benchmark interest rates and product spreads during the period. The Company assesses securities in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities, and therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded.

The credit quality of the Company's securities holdings is primarily investment grade. U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, and obligations of U.S. government sponsored entities totaled $2.1 billion, or 81%, of the total portfolio.

The portfolio includes $139.1 million, with a fair value of $125.2 million, in private label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Included are $126.8 million, with a fair value of $114.1 million, in private label mortgage-backed residential securities with weighted average credit support of 22%. The collateral underlying these mortgage investments includes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Non-guaranteed agency commercial securities totaled $12.2 million, with a fair value of $11.1 million. These securities have weighted average credit support of 22%. The collateral underlying these mortgages is primarily pooled multifamily loans.

The Company also has invested $307.7 million in floating rate collateralized loan obligations. Collateralized loan obligations are special purpose vehicles that purchase first lien broadly syndicated corporate loans while providing support to senior tranche investors. As of September 30, 2023, all of the Company's collateralized loan obligations were in AAA/AA tranches with weighted average credit support of 33%. The Company utilizes credit models with assumptions of loan level defaults, recoveries, and prepayments to evaluate each security for potential credit losses. The result of this analysis did not indicate expected credit losses.

Held-to-maturity securities consist solely of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities, each of which is expected to recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to maturity. The Company has significant liquidity and available borrowing capacity through other sources if needed, and has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity.

At September 30, 2023, the Company has determined that all debt securities in an unrealized loss position are the result of both broad investment type spreads and the current interest rate environment. Management believes that each investment will recover any price depreciation over its holding period as the debt securities move to maturity, and management has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity if necessary. Therefore, at September 30, 2023, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded.

Loan Portfolio
--------------

Loans, net of unearned income and excluding the allowance for credit losses, were $10.0 billion at September 30, 2023, a $1.9 billion, or 23%, increase from December 31, 2022. The increase during 2023 included $2.0 billion added through the Professional acquisition.

The Company remains committed to sound risk management procedures. Portfolio diversification in terms of asset mix, industry, and loan type has been an important element of the Company's lending strategy. The average loan size is only $306 thousand, and the average commercial loan size is only $683 thousand at September 30, 2023, reflecting the Company's longtime focus on granularity and on creating valuable customer relationships. Lending policies contain guardrails that pertain to lending by type of collateral and purpose, along with limits regarding loan concentrations and the principal amount of loans. The Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending remains well below regulatory limits (see "Loan Concentrations").

The following table details loan portfolio composition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for portfolio loans, purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") and loans purchased which are not considered purchased credit deteriorated ("Non-PCD") as defined in Note 4-Loans.

The amortized cost basis of loans included net deferred costs of $38.1 million at September 30, 2023 and $35.1 million at December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023, the remaining fair value adjustments on acquired loans were $186.5 million, or 4.9%, of the outstanding acquired loan balances, compared to $97.7 million, or 4.3%, of the acquired loan balances at December 31, 2022. The discount is accreted into interest income over the remaining lives of the related loans on a level yield basis.

The following table details commercial real estate - non-owner occupied loans.

Commercial real estate ("CRE") non-owner occupied loans increased by $696.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, totaling $3.3 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2022. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are collateralized by properties where the source of repayment is typically from the sale or lease of the property. Within the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio, the largest segment is Retail properties, which totaled approximately $1.0 billion at September 30, 2023. This segment targets grocery or credit tenant-anchored shopping plazas, single credit tenant retail buildings, smaller outparcels, and other small retail units. Loans in this segment have a weighted average loan to value of 52% and an average loan size of $2.0 million. The second-largest segment in the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio is Office properties, which totaled approximately $595.4 million at September 30, 2023. This segment targets low to mid-rise suburban offices and is broadly diversified across many types of professional services. There is limited exposure to central business districts. Loans in this segment have a weighted average loan to value of 55% and an average loan size of $1.6 million.

Owner-occupied CRE loans increased by $197.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.7 billion. Owner-occupied CRE is used by the owner, where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from business operations housed within the property.

Commercial and financial loans are extended to commercial customers for working capital, physical asset expansion, asset acquisition or other business purposes. Balances increased from December 31, 2022 by $235.4 million, or 17%, totaling $1.6 billion at September 30, 2023, largely attributed to the Professional acquisition.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Table of Contents
-----------------

Residential mortgage loans increased $569.4 million to $2.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in the balance as of September 30, 2023, were $1.0 billion of fixed rate mortgages, $840.1 million of adjustable rate mortgages and $478.6 million in primarily floating rate home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs"), compared to $964.3 million, $402.3 million and $482.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The increases from December 31, 2022 include approximately $483.6 million acquired through the Professional acquisition. Borrowers in the residential real estate portfolio have an average credit score of 752.

Substantially all residential originations have been underwritten to conventional loan agency standards, including loan balances that exceed agency value limitations. The average LTV of our HELOC portfolio is 63%, with 31% of the loans being in first lien position at September 30, 2023, compared to an average LTV of 69%, with 31% of the portfolio being in the first lien position at December 31, 2022.

The Company also provides consumer loans, which include installment loans, auto loans, marine loans, and other consumer loans, which decreased $38.0 million, or 13%, to total $248.5 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $286.6 million at December 31, 2022.

At September 30, 2023, the Company had unfunded commitments to extend credit of $3.9 billion, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022.

Loan Concentrations
-------------------

The Company has developed guardrails to manage loan types that are most impacted by stressed market conditions to minimize credit risk concentration to capital. Outstanding balances for commercial and CRE loans individually greater than $15 million totaled $574.9 million and represented 6% of the total portfolio at September 30, 2023.

Concentrations in total construction and land development loans and total CRE loans are maintained well below regulatory limits. Construction and land development and CRE loan concentrations as a percentage of subsidiary bank total risk based capital were 51% and 248%, respectively, at September 30, 2023, compared to 45% and 230%, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of Professional Bank. Regulatory guidance suggests limits of 100% and 300%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 48% and 234%, respectively, of total consolidated risk based capital. To determine these ratios, the Company defines CRE in accordance with the guidance on "Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending" (the "Guidance") issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in 2006 (and reinforced in 2015), which defines CRE loans as exposures secured by land development and construction, including 1-4 family residential construction, multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (i.e., loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Loans to real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and unsecured loans to developers that closely correlate to the inherent risks in CRE markets would also be considered CRE loans under the Guidance. Loans on owner-occupied CRE are generally excluded. In addition, the Company is subject to a geographic concentration of credit because it primarily operates in Florida.

Nonperforming Loans, Troubled Borrower Modifications, Other Real Estate Owned and Credit Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nonperforming assets ("NPAs") at September 30, 2023 totaled $48.7 million, and were comprised of $41.5 million of nonaccrual loans, and $7.2 million of other real estate owned ("OREO"). Compared to December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans increased $12.7 million, or 44%, including loans acquired from Professional. The $4.9 million increase in OREO is the result of closures of three branch properties in the first quarter of 2023. Overall, NPAs increased $17.6 million, or 56%, from $31.1 million as of December 31, 2022. At September 30, 2023, approximately 67% of nonaccrual loans were secured with real estate. See the tables below for details about nonaccrual loans. At September 30, 2023, nonaccrual loans reflected cumulative write downs of approximately $6.5 million, including reserves on individually evaluated loans.

Nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding at September 30, 2023 increased to 0.41% from 0.35% at December 31, 2022. Nonperforming assets to total assets at September 30, 2023 increased to 0.33% from 0.26% at December 31, 2022.

The table below sets forth details related to nonaccrual loans.

In accordance with regulatory reporting requirements, loans are placed on nonaccrual following the Retail Classification of Loan interagency guidance. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on loans, except consumer loans, that become 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization, guarantees or other security. Consumer loans that become 120 days past due are generally charged off. The loan carrying value is analyzed and any changes are appropriately made as described above quarterly.

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 which includes disclosure requirements related to certain modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which the Company refers to as troubled borrower modifications ("TBMs"). TBMs are typically in the form of an interest rate reduction, an extension of the amortization period and/or converting the loan to interest only for a limited period of time. In addition to the change in payment terms, the Company seeks to obtain additional collateral and/or guarantors to provide additional support for the loan. The Company does not typically provide forgiveness of principal as a modification. As of September 30, 2023, there were eight loans totaling $2.2 million that were TBMs, which is considered immaterial.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
------------------------------------

Management establishes the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The forecasts of future economic conditions are over a period that has been deemed reasonable and supportable, and in segments where it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded provision expense of $33.5 million. The provision expense included $26.6 million for loans acquired in the Professional acquisition. The Company reported net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $16.6 million.

The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.49% at September 30, 2023, 1.40% at December 31, 2022, and 1.42% at September 30, 2022.

LIBOR Transition
----------------

The Company's LIBOR transition steering committee has been responsible for overseeing the execution of the Company's enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program, and for evaluating and mitigating risks associated with the transition from LIBOR. The remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased publication after June 30, 2023. The Company reviewed its LIBOR loan contracts and customer swap agreements to identify required remediation to support the transition away from LIBOR. As of June 30, 2023, substantially all of these contracts included standardized fallback language or were amended to new reference rates, which are predominantly SOFRbased. The Company also invests in securities and has issued subordinated debt indexed to LIBOR which, as expected, have transitioned to SOFR-based reference rates or will transition on their next reset date in accordance with existing fallback provisions of the LIBOR Act. The transition did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Liquidity Risk Management
-------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liability, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments and unexpected deposit outflows.

Funding sources include primarily customer-based deposits, collateral-backed borrowings, brokered deposits, cash flows from operations, cash flows from the loan and investment portfolios and asset sales, primarily secondary marketing for residential real estate mortgages. Cash flows from operations are a significant component of liquidity risk management and the Company considers both deposit maturities and the scheduled cash flows from loan and investment maturities and payments when managing risk.

Cash and cash equivalents, including interest bearing deposits, totaled $696.0 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $201.9 million at December 31, 2022. Higher cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2023 reflect the Company's increased liquidity position strategy during the year.

Deposits are a primary source of liquidity. The stability of this funding source is affected by numerous factors, including returns available to customers on alternative investments, the quality of customer service levels, perception of safety and competitive forces. Uninsured deposits represented only 34% of overall deposit accounts at September 30, 2023. This includes public funds under the Florida Qualified Public Depository program, which provides loss protection to depositors beyond FDIC insurance limits. Excluding such balances, the uninsured and uncollateralized deposits were 29% of total deposits.

The Company routinely uses debt securities and loans as collateral for secured borrowings. In the event of severe market disruptions, the Company has access to secured borrowings through the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta under its borrower-in-custody program. The Company has liquidity sources as discussed below, including cash and lines of credit with the Federal Reserve and FHLB, that represent 158% of uninsured deposits, and 182% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.

In addition to $696.0 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023, the Company had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity, including $4.8 billion in available collateralized lines of credit, $0.6 billion of unpledged debt securities available as collateral for potential additional borrowings, and available unsecured lines of credit of $0.3 billion. Included in available borrowing capacity is approximately $0.4 billion under the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Funding Program, which the Company has not utilized and does not plan to utilize. The Company may also access funding by acquiring brokered deposits. Brokered deposits at September 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022 totaled $308.0 million, $58.6 million, and $81.8 million, respectively.

Contractual maturities for assets and liabilities are reviewed to meet current and expected future liquidity requirements. Sources of liquidity are maintained through a portfolio of high quality marketable assets, such as residential mortgage loans, debt securities available-for-sale and interest-bearing deposits. The Company is also able to provide short-term financing of its activities by selling, under an agreement to repurchase, United States Treasury and Government agency debt securities not pledged to secure public deposits or trust funds.

The Company has traditionally relied upon dividends from Seacoast Bank and securities offerings to provide funds to pay the Company's expenses and to service the Company's debt. During the third quarter of 2023, Seacoast Bank distributed $12.8 million to the Company and, at September 30, 2023, is eligible to distribute dividends to the Company of approximately $188.3

million without prior regulatory approval. At September 30, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents at the parent of approximately $115.0 million, compared to $111.8 million at December 31, 2022.

Deposits and Borrowings
-----------------------

Customer relationship funding is detailed in the following table for the periods specified:

Table of Contents

| (In thousands, except ratios) | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Noninterest demand | $ 3,868,132 | $ 4,070,973 |
| Interest-bearing demand | 2,800,152 | 2,337,590 |

| Customer sweep accounts | $ 276,450 | $ 172,029 |
| Noninterest demand deposits as % of total deposits | 32 % | 41 % |

The Company's balance sheet continues to be primarily funded by core deposits. Consumer deposits represent 43% of total deposits, with an average balance per account of $24 thousand. Business deposits represent 57% of total deposits, with an average balance per account of $111 thousand. Highlighting the Company's longstanding relationship-based strategy, the average tenure for a Seacoast customer is 9.7 years.

Total deposits increased $2.1 billion, or 21%, to $12.1 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects the impact of the Professional acquisition, which added $2.1 billion in deposits during the first quarter of 2023.

Noninterest demand deposits represented 32% of total deposits at September 30, 2023 and 41% at December 31, 2022. Transaction account balances (noninterest demand and interest-bearing demand) represented 55% of total deposits at September 30, 2023, compared to 64% at December 31, 2022.

Customer repurchase agreements totaled $276.5 million at September 30, 2023, increasing $104.4 million, or 61%, from December 31, 2022. Repurchase agreements are offered by Seacoast to select customers who wish to sweep excess balances on a daily basis for investment purposes.

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, borrowings included $72.1 million and $71.9 million, respectively, related to trust preferred securities issued by trusts organized or acquired by the Company.

On October 7, 2022, the Company acquired $12.3 million in subordinated debt through the acquisition of Apollo. Contractual interest is paid on a semiannual basis at a fixed rate of 5.50% until April 30, 2025, at which point the rate converts to a floating rate of 3-month SOFR plus 533 basis points. The debt was recorded at fair value, resulting in a $0.4 million premium that is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term to maturity.

On January 31, 2023, the Company acquired $25.0 million in subordinated debt through the acquisition of Professional. Contractual interest is paid on a semiannual basis at a fixed interest rate of 3.375% until January 30, 2027, at which point the rate converts to a 3-month SOFR rate plus 203 basis points paid quarterly. The debt was recorded at fair value, resulting in a $3.9 million discount that is being accreted into interest expense over the remaining term to maturity.

The weighted average interest rate of outstanding subordinated debt was 6.88% and 3.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled $110.0 million at September 30, 2023 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.88%, compared to $150.0 million at December 31, 2022 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.42%.

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
------------------------------

In the normal course of business, the Company may engage in a variety of financial transactions that, under generally accepted accounting principles, either are not recorded on the balance sheet or are recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. These transactions involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk.

Lending commitments include unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. For loan commitments, the contractual amount of a commitment represents the maximum potential credit risk that could result if the entire commitment had been funded, the borrower had not performed according to the terms of the contract, and no collateral had been provided. A large majority of loan commitments and standby letters of credit expire without being funded, and accordingly, total contractual amounts are not representative of actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements. Loan commitments and letters of credit expose the Company to credit risk in the event that the customer draws on the commitment and subsequently fails to perform under the terms of the lending agreement.

For commercial customers, loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements. For retail customers, loan commitments generally are lines of credit secured by residential property. These instruments are not recorded on the balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitment. Unfunded commitments to extend credit were $3.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022.

Capital Resources
-----------------

The Company's equity capital at September 30, 2023 increased $440.6 million, or 27%, from December 31, 2022 to $2.0 billion. Changes in equity included increases in net income of $74.5 million and the issuance of $4 21.0 million in equity in connection with the Professional acquisition, partially offset by the issuance of common stock dividends totaling $45.2 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $24.2 million.

The ratio of shareholders' equity to period end total assets was 13.82% and 13.24% at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets was 8.68% and 9.08% at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in the tangible common equity ratio was due to growth in the balance sheet from the Professional acquisition. Changes in the value of held-to-maturity securities are not reflected under GAAP; however, illustratively, if all held-to-maturity securities were presented at fair value, the tangible common equity ratio would have been 7.89% at September 30, 2023.

Activity in shareholders' equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 follows:

Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements for well-capitalized institutions. Management's use of risk-based capital ratios in its analysis of the Company's capital adequacy are not GAAP financial measures. Seacoast's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company. The capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies and Seacoast does not nor should investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for GAAP financial information (see "Note 8 Equity Capital").

| September 30, 2023 | Seacoast (Consolidated) | Seacoast Bank | Minimum to be Well- Capitalized 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 15.09% | 14.26% | 10.00% |
| Tier 1 Capital Ratio | 14.00 | 13.17 | 8.00 |

| Leverage Ratio | 10.71 | 10.05 | 5.00 |

The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 15.09% at September 30, 2023, a decrease from 15.79% at December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth including the acquisition of Professional. At September 30, 2023, the Bank's leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) was 10.05%, well above the minimum to be wellcapitalized under regulatory guidelines.

The Company and Seacoast Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast Bank and its other subsidiaries, and the Company's primary source of cash and liquidity, other than securities offerings and borrowings, is dividends from its bank subsidiary. Without Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") approval, Seacoast Bank can pay $188.3 million of dividends to the Company.

The OCC and the Federal Reserve have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings, and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by national banks and bank holding companies, respectively, if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If, in the particular circumstances, either of these federal regulators determined that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice, either the OCC or the Federal Reserve may, among other things, issue a cease and desist order prohibiting the payment of dividends by Seacoast Bank or us, respectively. The board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level, if any, is prudent relative to the organization's financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company, such as Seacoast, should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company's dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

The Company has paid quarterly dividends since the second quarter of 2021. Whether the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's earnings, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

The Company has seven wholly owned trust subsidiaries that have issued trust preferred stock. Trust preferred securities from acquisitions were recorded at fair value when acquired. All trust preferred securities are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis. The Federal Reserve's rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included under Basel III capital guidelines, with limitations, and net of goodwill and intangibles. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and believes that it can treat all its trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. For regulatory purposes, the trust preferred securities are added to the Company's tangible common shareholders' equity to calculate Tier 1 capital.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
------------------------------------------

The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, ("GAAP"), including prevailing practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain of its accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Management, after consultation with the Company's Audit Committee, believes the most critical accounting estimates and assumptions that involve the most difficult, subjective and complex assessments are:

* · the allowance and the provision for credit losses;
* · acquisition accounting and purchased loans;
* · intangible assets and impairment testing;
* · other fair value measurements;
* · impairment of debt securities; and
* · contingent liabilities.

The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&A in Seacoast's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements are discussed in "Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies" in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in "Note 1 - Basis of Presentation" in this report. There have been no changes to the Company's critical accounting policies during 2023.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
-------------------------

Fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of the Company's financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. This risk is managed using simulation modeling to calculate the most likely interest rate risk utilizing estimated loan and deposit growth. The objective is to optimize the Company's financial position, liquidity, and net interest income while limiting volatility.

Senior management regularly reviews the overall interest rate risk position and evaluates strategies to manage the risk. The Company's Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO") uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates. The simulation of rising, declining and flat interest rate scenarios allows management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to assess the impact of market interest rate swings. The analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve-month period is subjected to instantaneous changes in market rates and is monitored on a quarterly basis.

The following table presents the ALCO simulation model's projected impact of a change in interest rates on the projected baseline net interest income for the 12 month period beginning October 1, 2023, holding all balances on the balance sheet static. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not consider changes in the slope of the yield curve. In particular, the steepening or inversion of the yield curve as well as gradually changing interest rate changes could result in different outcomes when compared to the parallel shifts contemplated below.

% Change in Projected Baseline
------------------------------

Net Interest Income
-------------------

Table of Contents

| Change in Interest Rates | 1-12 months |
| --- | --- |
| +3.00% | (14.3)% |
| +2.00% | (7.0)% |
| +1.00% | (3.6)% |
| Current | -% |
| -1.00% | 0.9% |
| -2.00% | (0.3%) |
| -3.00% | (1.3%) |

The computations of interest rate risk do not necessarily include certain actions management may undertake to manage this risk in response to changes in interest rates. Management may adjust asset or liability pricing or structure in order to manage interest rate risk through an interest rate cycle. This may include the use of investment portfolio purchases or sales or the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, options, caps, floors, futures or forward contracts.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
----------------------------------------

The condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money, over time, due to inflation.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the general level of inflation. However, inflation affects financial institutions by increasing their cost of goods and services purchased, as well as the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and shareholders' equity. Mortgage origination and refinancing tends to slow as interest rates increase, and higher interest rates likely will reduce the Company's earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
------------------------------------------------------------------

See also Management's discussion and analysis "Interest Rate Sensitivity."

Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, and other relevant market rates or prices.

Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and Economic Value of Equity, or "EVE," to adverse movements in interest rates, is the Company's primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet (non-trading activities). The Company is also exposed to market risk in its investing activities. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee, or "ALCO," meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by the Company's board of directors. The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the board of directors. These limits reflect the Company's tolerance for interest rate risk over short-term and long-term horizons.

The Company also performs valuation analyses, which are used for evaluating levels of risk present in the balance sheet that might not be considered in the net interest income simulation analyses. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows, the net result of which is the EVE. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term re-pricing risks and options risks embedded in the balance sheet. In contrast to the net interest income simulation, which assumes interest rates will change over a period of time, EVE uses instantaneous changes in rates.

EVE values only the current balance sheet, and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of

balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate life deposit portfolios. Core deposits are a more significant funding source for the Company, making the lives attached to core deposits more important to the accuracy of EVE modeling. The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions regarding the indeterminate lives of core deposits utilizing an independent third-party resource to assist. These assumptions could see greater volatility due to changes in the level of interest rates and recent industry events. With higher interest rates, the average lives of core deposits have trended lower and unfavorably impacted model estimates of EVE. In addition, the Company's acquisitions have changed the composition of the balance sheet, both of which have resulted in changes to our EVE profile.

The following table presents the projected impact of a change in interest rates on the balance sheet. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.

Table of Contents

| Change in Interest Rates | % Change in Economic Value of Equity |
| --- | --- |
| +3.00% | (18.9)% |
| +2.00% | (12.5)% |
| +1.00% | (5.5)% |
| Current | -% |
| -1.00% | 3.9% |
| -2.00% | 6.9% |
| -3.00% | 7.9% |

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon, i.e., the next fiscal year. Further, EVE does not consider factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, change in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-------------------------------

The Company's management, with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2023 and concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
-------------------------

The Company and its subsidiaries, because of the nature of their business, are at all times subject to numerous legal actions, threatened or filed. Management presently believes that none of the legal proceedings to which it is a party are likely to have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, or operating results or cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
---------------------

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should consider the factors discussed in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and prospective results. The risks described in this report, in our Form 10-K or our other SEC filings are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be

immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

On December 15, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the renewal of the Company's share repurchase program, under which the Company may, from time to time, purchase up to $100 million of its shares of outstanding common stock. Under the share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2023, repurchases will be made, if at all, in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchase or by negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases, if any, will be based on a variety of factors, including share acquisition price, regulatory limitations, market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to purchase any of its shares, and may be terminated or amended by the Board of Directors at any time prior to its expiration date.

As of September 30, 2023, 2,515 shares of the Company's common stock had been repurchased under the program.
