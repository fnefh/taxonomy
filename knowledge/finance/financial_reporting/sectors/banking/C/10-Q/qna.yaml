      Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per share in Q1
      2024, compared to net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per share in the
      prior-year period. Net income decreased 27% versus the prior-year period,
      driven by higher expenses, higher cost of credit and lower revenues.
      Citigroup's effective tax rate was approximately 25% in both periods.
      Revenues of $21.1 billion decreased 2% versus the prior-year period on a
      reported basis.
    questions:
      - question: What were Citigroup's key financial results for Q1 2024?
        answer: Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion ($1.58 per share), down
          27% from $4.6 billion ($2.19 per share) in Q1 2023. Revenues were
          $21.1 billion, down 2% from the prior year.
      - question: What factors drove the decline in Citigroup's Q1 2024 net income?
        answer: The 27% decline in net income was driven by higher expenses, higher cost
          of credit, and lower revenues, with an effective tax rate of
          approximately 25%.

      Citigroup reported net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.52 per share in Q2
      2024, compared to net income of $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per share in the
      prior-year period. Net income increased 10% versus the prior-year period,
      as higher revenues and lower expenses more than offset higher cost of
      credit. Revenues of $20.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior-year
      period, driven by growth across all reportable operating segments,
      including an approximate $400 million episodic gain related to the Visa B
      exchange.
    questions:
      - question: How did Citigroup perform in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023?
        answer: Citigroup's net income increased 10% to $3.2 billion ($1.52 per share)
          from $2.9 billion ($1.33 per share), with revenues up 4% to $20.1
          billion, driven by growth across all segments and including a $400
          million Visa B exchange gain.
      - question: What drove the improvement in Citigroup's Q2 2024 performance?
        answer: The improved performance was driven by higher revenues across all
          segments (including a $400 million Visa B exchange gain) and lower
          expenses, which more than offset higher cost of credit.

      Citigroup reported net income of $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per share in Q3
      2023, up 2% from $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per share in the prior-year
      period. The net income increase was driven by higher revenues, partially
      offset by higher expenses, higher cost of credit and a higher effective
      tax rate of 25% versus 20% in the prior-year period. Revenues of $20.1
      billion increased 9% versus the prior-year period, driven by strength
      across Services and Markets in ICG and U.S. Personal Banking in PBWM.
    questions:
      - question: What were Citigroup's key financial results for Q3 2023?
        answer: Citigroup reported net income of $3.5 billion ($1.63 per share), up 2%
          from the prior year, with revenues increasing 9% to $20.1 billion,
          driven by strong performance in Services, Markets, and U.S. Personal
          Banking.
      - question: What factors impacted Citigroup's tax rate in Q3 2023?
        answer: Citigroup's effective tax rate increased to 25% from 20% in the
          prior-year period, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings in
          the quarter.
  - context: >
      Services net income of $1.5 billion increased 21% in Q2 2024 from the
      prior-year period, driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues,
      partially offset by higher expenses. Services revenues of $4.7 billion
      increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services
      and continued momentum in TTS. Securities Services revenues increased 10%,
      while TTS revenues remained largely unchanged versus the prior-year
      period.
    questions:
      - question: How did the Services segment perform in Q2 2024?
        answer: Services net income increased 21% to $1.5 billion, with revenues up 3%
          to $4.7 billion, driven by growth in Securities Services (up 10%) and
          continued momentum in TTS, though TTS revenues were largely unchanged.
      - question: What drove Securities Services revenue growth in Q2 2024?
        answer: Securities Services revenue growth of 10% was driven by a 14% increase
          in net interest income from higher deposit spreads, and a 7% increase
          in non-interest revenue from higher assets under custody and
          administration balances.
  - context: >
      U.S. Personal Banking net income of $121 million decreased 74% in Q2
      2024 from the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit,
      partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. Cost of credit
      increased to $2.3 billion from $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit
      losses and a higher net ACL build for loans. USPB revenues of $4.9 billion
      increased 6%, driven by loan growth in cards and lower partner payments.
    questions:
      - question: How did U.S. Personal Banking perform in Q2 2024?
        answer: U.S. Personal Banking net income decreased 74% to $121 million despite
          6% revenue growth to $4.9 billion, as cost of credit increased
          significantly to $2.3 billion from $1.5 billion in the prior year.
      - question: What drove the increase in USPB's cost of credit in Q2 2024?
        answer: The higher cost of credit was driven by increased net credit losses from
          the maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic
          period, macroeconomic pressures from higher inflation and interest
          rates, and an ACL build reflecting cards loan growth.
