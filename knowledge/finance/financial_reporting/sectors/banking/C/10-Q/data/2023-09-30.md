<p>Please see "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are provided as additional useful information to assess Citi's financial condition and results of operations, including providing an additional meaningful depiction of underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nonGAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.</p>
<p>Citi's non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Results excluding divestiture-related impacts</li>
<li>· Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)</li>
<li>· Banking and Corporate lending revenues excluding gains (losses) on loan hedges</li>
<li>· NonICG Markets net interest income</li>
</ul>
<p>Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts represent as reported, or GAAP, financial results adjusted for items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi's announced 14 exit markets. For additional information on results excluding divestiture-related impacts, see "Executive Summary" and " Legacy Franchises " below.</p>
<p>For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see "Capital Resources-Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity" below.</p>
<p>For more information on Banking and Corporate lending revenues excluding gains (losses) on loan hedges, see "Executive Summary" and " Institutional Clients Group " below.</p>
<p>For more information on nonICG Markets net interest income, see "Market Risk-NonICG Markets Net Interest Income" below.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup was managed pursuant to three operating segmentsInstitutional Clients Group , Personal Banking and Wealth Management and Legacy Franchises -across four regions. Activities not assigned to the operating segments were included in Corporate/Other .</p>

<p>For a further description of the operating segments and the products and services they provided, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below. The results for the four regions in which Citigroup operated as of September 30, 2023 were fully reflected in the operating segments and Corporate/Other .</p>
<h2>Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure</h2>
<p>As part of Citi's overall simplification, Citi previously disclosed that as of the fourth quarter of 2023 it will be making changes to its operating model to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy.</p>
<p>Citi's new operating model includes the elimination of the ICG , PBWM and Legacy Franchises operating segments and will result in five new reportable operating segmentsServices , Markets , Banking , Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking -and a new financial reporting structure, effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments will be included in a new All Other category, which will consist of Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, as outlined below.</p>
<p>Citi will also consolidate its regional structure from four to two regions, consisting of North America and a newly created international group. Citi expects to incur charges through the first half of 2024 as additional phases of its overall simplification initiatives are finalized and implemented. For additional information on expenses, see "Executive Summary-Expenses" below.</p>

<h2>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<h2>Third Quarter of 2023-Results Demonstrated Strength of Diversified Business Model and Progress Toward Priorities</h2>
<p>As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the third quarter of 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Citi's revenues increased 9% versus the prior-year period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts (see " Legacy Franchises " below), revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest income and non-interest revenues.</li>
<li>· Citi's expenses increased 6% versus the prior-year period, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts (see " Legacy Franchises " below), largely driven by continued investments in risk and controls, the impacts of inflation and severance. The increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see "Expenses" below).</li>
<li>· Citi's cost of credit was $1.8 billion versus $1.4 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by the ongoing normalization in net credit losses and volume growth in Branded cards and Retail services in PBWM .</li>
<li>· Citi returned $1.5 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.</li>
<li>· Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.6% as of September 30, 2023, compared to 12.3% as of September 30, 2022 (see "Capital Resources" below). This compares to Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of October 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach.</li>
<li>· Citi continued to make progress on its consumer banking business divestitures in the third quarter of 2023, including the closing of its Taiwan sale transaction and working toward the closing of its Indonesia sale transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. (For additional information on the progress of Citi's other exits and wind-downs, see " Legacy Franchises " below.)</li>
<li>· As previously disclosed, Citi announced it will be making changes to its operating model to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy. This new operating model will elevate the leaders of Citi's five key businesses and eliminate management layers, and reflect the next step in Citi's work to implement its strategic and other initiatives. For additional information, see "Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure" above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Quarter of 2023 Results Summary</h2>
<h2>Citigroup</h2>
<p>Citigroup reported net income of $3,546 million in the current quarter, up 2%, compared to net income of $3,479 million in the prior-year period, or $1.63 per share, unchanged from the prior-year period. The net income increase was driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by the higher expenses, the higher cost of credit and a higher effective tax rate. Citigroup's effective tax rate was 25% versus 20% in the prior-year period, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings in the current quarter (see "Income Taxes" below).</p>
<p>Results for the third quarter of 2023 included divestiture-related impacts of $299 million in earnings before taxes ($214 million after-tax). See " Legacy Franchises " below for details about the divestiture-related impacts. These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $0.11 beneficial impact on earnings per share (EPS) in the current quarter. Excluding these divestiturerelated impacts, EPS was $1.52. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)</p>
<p>Results for the third quarter of 2022 included divestiture-related impacts of $519 million in earnings before taxes ($256 million after-tax). See " Legacy Franchises " below for details about the divestiture-related impacts. These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $0.13 beneficial impact on EPS in the prior-year period. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.50.</p>
<p>Citigroup revenues of $20.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023 increased 9% on a reported basis, and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts versus the prior-year period. The increase in revenues reflected strength across Services and Markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and U.S. Personal Banking in Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) , as well as growth in Banking in ICG. The increase was partially offset by a revenue reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy Franchises .</p>
<p>Citigroup's end-of-period loans were $666 billion, up 3% versus the prioryear period, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking.</p>
<p>Citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 3% versus the prior-year period. The decline in deposits was largely due to a reduction in Services, reflecting monetary tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth) and a reduction of institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other . For additional information about Citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business's results of operations and "Liquidity Risk-Deposits" below.</p>
<h2>Expenses</h2>
<p>Citigroup's operating expenses of $13.5 billion increased 6% from the prioryear period, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts. The higher expenses largely reflected continued investments in risk and controls, the impact of inflation and severance, partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises. Expenses also continued to be impacted by investments in Citi's transformation and business- and enterprise-led investments.</p>
<p>Citi expects to continue to incur higher expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, including additional severance costs related to its organizational and management simplification initiatives.</p>
<h2>Cost of Credit</h2>
<p>Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher net credit losses (see below), partially offset by a lower net build in the ACL for loans and unfunded commitments and other provisions.</p>
<p>The net build of $203 million in the ACL for loans and unfunded lending commitments and other provisions in the current quarter was primarily driven by growth in Branded cards and Retail services card balances in PBWM . This compared to a net build of $478 million in the ACL for loans and unfunded lending commitments and other provisions in the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)" below.</p>
<p>Net credit losses of $1.6 billion increased 85% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $1.6 billion increased 79%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit losses increased to $58 million from $6 million in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>Citi expects to incur higher year-over-year net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by ongoing normalization, particularly in the cards businesses in PBWM. Net credit losses in the cards businesses are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023 .</p>
<p>For additional information on Citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "Credit Risk" below.</p>
<h2>Capital</h2>
<p>Citigroup's CET1 Capital ratio was 13.6% as of September 30, 2023, compared to 12.3% as of September 30, 2022, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by net income and impacts from the sales of certain Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer) businesses, as well as business actions, including a reduction in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common dividends and share repurchases.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2023, Citi repurchased $0.5 billion of common shares and paid $1.0 billion of common dividends (see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below). Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below.</p>
<p>Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of September 30, 2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.7% as of September 30, 2022, and 5.8% as of December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital from net income, partially offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, see "Capital Resources" below.</p>
<h2>Institutional Clients Group</h2>
<p>ICG net income of $2.4 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. ICG operating expenses of $7.2 billion increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risks and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>
<p>ICG revenues of $10.6 billion increased 12% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), driven by growth across Services, Markets and Banking, partially offset by an approximate $180 million net impact from a currency devaluation in Argentina on Citi's net investment in the country. Revenues also included a loss on loan hedges of $47 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared with a loss on loan hedges of $56 million in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 13%. TTS revenues of $3.6 billion increased 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income and 1% growth in non-interest revenue. The increase in TTS net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and deposit volume growth. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by continued growth in underlying drivers, primarily a 16% increase in cross-border transaction value, a 6% increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume and an 8% increase in commercial card spend volume. The increase in non-interest revenue was largely offset by the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on Citi's net investment in the country. Securities services revenues of $1.1 billion increased 16%, largely driven by higher net interest income across currencies.</p>
<p>Markets revenues of $4.5 billion increased 10%, driven by an increase of 14% in Fixed income markets, largely reflecting strength in rates and currencies. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 3% in Equity markets, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in equity cash and prime services.</p>
<p>Banking revenues of $1.4 billion increased 18%, including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.5 billion increased 17%, driven by higher revenues in Investment banking. Investment banking revenues of $844 million increased 34%, reflecting increased client activity in debt underwriting and an absence of certain realized and unrealized gains (losses) in the prior-year period. Corporate lending revenues increased 2%, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate lending revenues increased 1% versus the prior-year period. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.)</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the third quarter of 2023, see " Institutional Clients Group " below.</p>
<h2>Personal Banking and Wealth Management</h2>
<p>PBWM net income of $803 million increased 1%, as higher revenues were largely offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion increased 5%, largely driven by investments in risks and controls and severance, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>
<p>PBWM revenues of $6.8 billion increased 10%, driven by growth in net interest income, reflecting strong loan growth in U.S. Personal Banking, as well as higher non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in Retail services and higher investment product revenues in Global Wealth.</p>
<p>U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.9 billion increased 13%, primarily driven by higher revenues in cards, partially offset by lower Retail banking revenues. Branded cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as average loans increased 12%. Retail services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 21%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as well as the lower partner payments. Retail banking revenues of $624 million decreased 3%, largely driven by the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Global Wealth, partially offset by higher deposit spreads.</p>
<p>Global Wealth revenues of $1.9 billion increased 2%, primarily driven by higher investment product revenues across all regions, the benefit of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits from Retail banking, and higher lending revenue.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of PBWM for the third quarter of 2023, see " Personal Banking and Wealth Management " below.</p>
<h2>Legacy Franchises</h2>
<p>Legacy Franchises net income was $125 million, compared to $316 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses. Legacy Franchises operating expenses of $1.8 billion decreased 3%, primarily driven by the impact of exited markets and continued wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs and the impact of FX translation in Mexico</p>
<p>Consumer, Small Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico Consumer/SBMM).</p>
<p>Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.2 billion decreased 13%, largely driven by the lower gain on sale impacts in Asia Consumer and reductions from exited markets and continued wind-downs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM, largely reflecting the impact of FX translation, higher interest rates and volume growth.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of Legacy Franchises for the third quarter of 2023, see " Legacy Franchises " below.</p>
<h2>Corporate/Other</h2>
<p>Corporate/Other net income was $189 million, compared to $209 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by lower income tax benefits, partially offset by higher revenues and lower operating expenses. Corporate/Other operating expenses of $237 million decreased from $286 million in the prioryear period, primarily driven by lower consulting expenses.</p>
<p>Corporate/Other revenues of $500 million increased from $299 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by the absence of prior-year mark-tomarket losses, primarily related to retained interchange litigation risk associated with shares of Visa B common stock that Citi previously sold.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the third quarter of 2023, see " Corporate/Other " below.</p>
<h2>Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties</h2>
<p>Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including continued elevated interest rates and inflation, economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, the Russia-Ukraine war and escalating tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, and a potential U.S. government shutdown. These and other factors have adversely affected financial markets, negatively impacted global economic growth rates and resulted in a continued risk of recession in the U.S., Europe and other regions and countries. In addition, these and other factors could adversely affect Citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed in May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposal that would implement a special assessment to recover its uninsured deposit losses from recent bank failures. The FDIC estimated that the preliminary cost of the failures is approximately $15.8 billion, an estimate that would be periodically adjusted. The FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured U.S. deposits, over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 2024. Citi is likely to incur up to a $1.5 billion pretax charge, impacting operating expenses, if the final rule for the FDIC special assessment, which is expected before the end of 2023, is enacted as proposed.</p>
<p>Additionally, in July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame, related to regulatory capital requirements that, if finalized as proposed, would have a material impact on Citi's current capital position. For additional information, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments-Basel III Revisions" below.</p>
<p>For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during the remainder of 2023, see "Third Quarter of 2023 Results Summary" above and each respective business's results of operations, "Managing Global Risk," including "Managing Global Risk-Other RisksCountry Risk-Russia" and "-Argentina," and "Forward-Looking Statements" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>For information on Citi's planned revision to its financial reporting structure as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, including, among other things, the elimination of the ICG operating segment and the resulting creation of three new reportable operating segments ( Services , consisting of Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services; Markets , consisting of Fixed Income and Equity markets; and Banking , consisting of Investment Banking and Corporate Lending), see "Planned Revision to Operating Model and Financial Reporting Structure" above.</p>
<p>ICG 's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.

<p>At September 30, 2023, ICG had $1.7 trillion in assets and $782 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.0 trillion in assets under custody and administration at September 30, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to $1.8 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion at September 30, 2023. For additional information on these operations, see "Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees" in Note 5.</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the mark-tomarket on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. NM Not meaningful</p>
<p>The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.</p>
<h2>3Q23 vs. 3Q22</h2>
<p>Net income of $2.4 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 12% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), driven by higher Services, Banking and Markets revenues, partially offset by an approximate $180 million net impact from a currency devaluation in Argentina on Citi's net investment in the country. Services revenues were up 13%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities services. Banking revenues were up 18% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting higher revenues in both Investment banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by higher revenues in Fixed income markets, partially offset by lower revenues in Equity markets.</p>
<p>Citi expects revenues in its Markets and Investment banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market environment during the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Within Services:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· TTS revenues increased 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income and 1% growth in non-interest revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client segments. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as growth in deposits, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on deposits. Average deposits increased 2%, largely driven by growth in EMEA, Asia and Latin America. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, average deposits were down, mainly in North America, driven by portfolio optimization efforts and monetary tightening. Average loans increased 2%, mainly driven by growth in Latin America and North America. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by strong fee growth in the cash business, reflecting solid client engagement and continued growth of underlying drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 16%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 6%) and commercial card spend (up 8%). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely offset by the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina.</li>
<li>· Securities services revenues increased 16%, as net interest income grew 36%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits. The decline in average deposits reflected the impact of monetary tightening. Non-interest revenues increased 3%, driven by higher fees due to higher assets under custody and administration and continued elevated levels of corporation actions in Issuer services. The increase in</li>
</ul>
<p>non-interest revenue was partially offset by the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina.</p>
<h2>Within Markets:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Fixed income markets increased 14%, driven by North America, largely reflecting strength in rates and currencies despite continued lower market volatility.</li>
<li>Rates and currencies increased 12%, driven by a conducive rate environment and associated market-making activity. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 21%. This increase was driven by North America, reflecting higher commodities revenue, and growth in the financing and securitization business, including increased client or market activity.</li>
<li>· Equity markets revenues decreased 3%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in equity cash and prime services. The decline in equity derivatives revenues reflected a more challenging macroeconomic environment and lower volatility. The increase in equity cash revenue was driven by increased client activity. Prime services revenues increased modestly and the business continued to grow prime finance balances.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Within Banking:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Investment banking revenues increased 34%, as strength in equity and debt underwriting was partially offset by a decline in advisory. Advisory revenues decreased 21%, reflecting a decline in EMEA, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties resulting in a lower market wallet, in addition to lower wallet share. Equity underwriting revenues increased 32%, reflecting growth in EMEA and North America, driven by growth in wallet share, partially offset by lower market wallet. Debt underwriting revenues increased 190%, reflecting growth in North America and EMEA, driven by wallet share gains, largely in investment grade, as well as growth in leveraged loans. The increase in debt underwriting revenues also reflected an absence of certain realized and unrealized losses of $110 million in the prior-year period, compared to gains of $16 million in the current-year period.</li>
<li>· Corporate lending revenues increased 2%, including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased modestly (up 1%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investment in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>
<p>Provisions reflected a cost of $196 million, compared to $86 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL build for loans and higher net credit losses. Net credit losses were $51 million, compared to no losses in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>The ACL build was $145 million, compared to $86 million in the prioryear period, largely driven by an ACL build for loans of $101 million, primarily due to specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, partially offset by improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.

<h2>2023 YTD vs. 2022 YTD</h2>
<p>Net income of $7.9 billion decreased 10%, primarily driven by higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by a modest increase in revenues.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 1% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), driven by higher Services revenues, partially offset by lower Banking and Markets revenues as well as the approximate $180 million net impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina. Services revenues increased 18%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities services. Banking revenues declined 27% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues declined 3%, driven by lower revenues in Equity markets, reflecting lower client activity, driven by decreased volatility and a strong prior-year comparison.</p>

<li>· TTS revenues increased 18%, with growth in net interest income of 24% and non-interest revenue of 7%, largely driven by the same factors described above.</li>
<li>· Securities services revenues increased 18%, reflecting higher net interest income, largely driven by the same factors described above. Non-interest revenue declined 3%, as a decrease in revenues in the custody business and the impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina were partially offset by an increase in Issuer services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Within Markets:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Fixed income markets revenues were largely unchanged. Rates and currencies revenues increased 4%, driven by strength in rates, partially offset by a decline in the currencies business, primarily reflecting lower volatility and a strong prior-year comparison. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 11%, driven by lower client activity.</li>
<li>· Equity markets revenues decreased 14%, primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, largely driven by the same factors described above, as well as a modest decline in equity cash.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Within Banking:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Investment banking revenues decreased 9%. Advisory revenues decreased 31%, primarily driven by lower market wallet. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 13%, driven by lower wallet share. Debt underwriting revenues increased 18%, driven by growth in wallet share, partially offset by a decline in market wallet.</li>
<li>· Corporate lending revenues decreased 43%, including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 12%, primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency translation, as well as lower volumes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investment in Citi's transformation, investments in TTS, other risk and controls investments, volume-related expenses and other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings and FX translation.</p>
<p>Provisions reflected a cost of $182 million, compared to $855 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses were $146 million, compared to $48 million in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>The ACL build was $36 million, compared to $807 million in the prioryear period. The lower build was driven by the absence of Russia-related ACL builds in the prior-year period. The lower build was partially offset by a $458 million build for other assets, primarily related to an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.</p>

<p>During the third quarter of 2023, Citi returned a total of $1.5 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of $1.0 billion in dividends and $0.5 billion in share repurchases (approximately 12 million common shares). For additional information, see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below.</p>
<p>Citi paid common dividends of $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2023, and on October 19, 2023, declared common dividends of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common dividend of at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors' approval. In addition, as previously announced, Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below.</p>
<h2>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio</h2>
<p>Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.6% as of September 30, 2023, compared to 13.4% as of June 30, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. This compares to a CET1 Capital ratio of 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 11.5% as of such date under the Standardized Approach.</p>
<p>Citi's CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.5% as of September 30, 2023, largely unchanged from June 30, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework. This compares to a CET1 Capital ratio of 12.1% as of December 31, 2022, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.0% as of such date under the Advanced Approaches.</p>
<p>Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under the Standardized Approach from June 30, 2023, driven primarily by net income and impacts from the sales of Asia Consumer businesses, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from year-end 2022, driven primarily by year-to-date net income of $11.1 billion and impacts from the sales of Asia Consumer businesses, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders. The increase in the CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches was also partially offset by an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA.</p>
<h2>Stress Capital Buffer</h2>
<p>In July 2023, the Federal Reserve Board confirmed Citi's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement of 4.3%, increased from 4.0%, for the four-quarter window starting from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as of October 1, 2023, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio increased to 12.3% from 12.0% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.3% SCB and its current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding regulatory capital buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Buffers" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Citibank's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.1% at September 30,</p>
<p>2023 and June 30, 2023, compared to 6.9% at December 31, 2022. The yearto-date increase was driven by a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, primarily due to lower average on-balance sheet assets, and an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to net income in 2023, partially offset by dividends.</p>
<h2>Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios</h2>
<p>The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup's and Citibank's capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of September 30, 2023. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup's or Citibank's financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.</p>

<h2>Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC's net capital rule, of $16 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $12 billion.</p>
<p>Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of $27 billion at September 30, 2023, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, certain of Citi's other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup's other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)</h2>
<p>The table below details Citi's eligible external TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) amounts and ratios, and each TLAC and LTD regulatory requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement:</p>
<p>| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars, except ratios | External TLAC | LTD |
| Total eligible amount | $ 337 | $ 152 |
| % of Advanced Approaches risk- weighted assets | 27.0 % | 12.1 % |
| Regulatory requirement (1)(2) | 22.5 | 9.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 56 | $ 33 |
| % of Total Leverage Exposure | 11.5 % | 5.2 % |
| Regulatory requirement | 9.5 | 4.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 59 | $ 20 |</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citi exceeded each of the TLAC and LTD regulatory requirements, resulting in a $20 billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's TLAC-related requirements, see "Capital Resources-Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments</h2>
<h2>Basel III Revisions</h2>
<p>On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<p>The capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule's dualrequirement structure for risk-weighted assets but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of risk-weighted assets. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints.</p>
<p>The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational risk-weighted asset amounts.</p>
<p>If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal's impact on risk-weighted asset amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see "GSIB Surcharge" below for additional changes in that area). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. Citi is currently reviewing the proposal and participating in the comment period. For additional information, see "Executive Summary" above.</p>
<h2>GSIB Surcharge</h2>
<p>Separately, the Federal Reserve Board proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year's surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands. This proposal is also subject to a comment period and provides that it would be effective two full calendar quarters after its finalization.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Debt Requirements</h2>
<p>On August 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. The proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. This proposal, which Citi is currently reviewing, is subject to a comment period and there is no proposed transition period for its implementation. The impact of the proposed rule in its current form is not expected to be material to Citi.</p>
<h2>Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity</h2>
<p>Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.</p>

<h2>MANAGING GLOBAL RISK</h2>
<p>For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi's risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi's Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi's risk appetite. For more information on managing global risk at Citi, see "Managing Global Risk" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>CREDIT RISK</h2>
<p>For more information on credit risk, including Citi's credit risk management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi's consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see "Credit Risk" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Loans</h2>
<p>The table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | 3Q23 | 2Q23 | 3Q22 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Banking and Wealth Management | | | |
| U.S. Retail banking | $ 43 | $ 40 | $ 36 |

| Total Citigroup loans (AVG) | $ 662 | $ 654 | $ 655 |
| Total Citigroup loans (EOP) | $ 666 | $ 661 | $ 646 |</p>
<p>On an average basis, loans increased 1% both year-over-year and sequentially as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. PBWM average loans increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG average loans decreased 4% year-over-year, reflecting actions taken to reduce RWA. Legacy Franchises average loans decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the impact of the continued wind-downs, particularly in Korea and China, partially offset by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.</p>
<p>End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, as growth in PBWM , reflecting an increase in U.S. Personal Banking, was partially offset by declines in ICG and Legacy Franchises. End-of-period loans increased 1% sequentially.</p>

<h2>Portfolio Mix-Geography and Counterparty</h2>
<p>Citi's corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage of this portfolio by region based on Citi's internal management geography:</p>
<p>| | September 30, 2023 | | June 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| North America | 56 | % | 56 % | 56 | % |
| EMEA | 25 | | 25 | 25 | |
| Asia | 12 | | 12 | 12 | |
| Latin America | 7 | | 7 | 7 | |
| Total | 100 | % | 100 % | 100 | % |</p>
<p>The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.</p>
<p>The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:</p>
<p>| | Total exposure | Total exposure | Total exposure | Total exposure | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | September 30, 2023 | | June 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | |
| AAA/AA/A | 49 | % | 49 % | 50 | % |
| BBB | 34 | | 34 | 34 | |
| BB/B | 15 | | 15 | 14 | |
| CCC or below | 2 | | 2 | 2 | |
| Total | 100 | % | 100 % | 100 | % |</p>
<p>Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.</p>
<p>In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi's interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.</p>
<p>Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p>Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2023. Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen.</p>
<p>As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi's seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.</p>

<h2>Credit Risk Mitigation</h2>
<p>As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial- and full-term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $36.0 billion, $38.5 billion and $39.8 billion, respectively. Citi's expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:</p>
<h2>Rating of Hedged Exposure</h2>

<h2>Consumer Credit Trends</h2>
<p>Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)</p>
<p>| Personal Banking and Wealth Management |
| --- |
| PBWM Update.jpg |</p>
<p>As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. Personal Banking provides card products through Branded cards and Retail services, and also provides mortgages and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans through Citi's Retail banking network. The Retail bank is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and personal, small business and other consumer loans through the Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, 45% of PBWM consumer loans consisted of U.S. cards loans. U.S. cards net credit losses represented approximately 94% of total PBWM losses.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates (due to certain loans migrating into laterstage delinquency buckets), primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization in Branded cards and Retail services, including macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>
<p>PBWM 's 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-overquarter and year-over-year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates (due to certain loans migrating into later-stage delinquency buckets), primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization in Branded cards and Retail services, including the macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>
<p>U.S. Personal Banking's Branded cards portfolio includes proprietary and co-branded cards.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Branded cards increased quarterover-quarter and year-over-year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates (due to certain loans migrating into later-stage delinquency buckets), primarily reflecting ongoing normalization, including macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>
<h2>Retail Services</h2>
<p>| Retail Services |
| --- |
| Citi-Retail Services.jpg |</p>
<p>U.S. Personal Banking's Retail services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail services' target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the third quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Retail services increased quarterover-quarter and year-over-year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates (due to certain loans migrating into later-stage delinquency buckets), primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization, including macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>
<p>For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi's cards portfolios, see each respective business's results of operations above and Note 13.</p>
<p>| | Retail Banking |
| --- | --- |
| US Retail.jpg | |</p>
<p>U.S. Personal Banking's Retail banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see "Loan-toValue (LTV) Ratios" in Note 13.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Retail banking for the third quarter of 2023 was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by growth and seasoning of the personal loans portfolio.</p>
<p>The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-overquarter, and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.</p>
<p>| Global Wealth |
| --- |
| |</p>
<p>As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolios primarily consist of consumer mortgages, cards and other lending products extended to customer segments that range from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, approximately $47 billion, or 31%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 95% is rated investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart above is calculated only for the delinquencymanaged</p>
<p>portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios. For more information on Citi's total commercial real estate exposure, see "Exposure to Commercial Real Estate" within the Corporate Credit section.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss and 90+ days past due delinquency rates in Global Wealth for the third quarter of 2023 were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The low levels of net credit losses and the 90+ days past due delinquency rate continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the Global Wealth portfolios.</p>
<h2>Legacy Franchises</h2>
<p>| Asia Consumer | Asia Consumer |
| --- | --- |
| Asia Consumer.jpg | |</p>
<p>Asia Consumer provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented. As discussed above, as of the third quarter of 2023, Asia Consumer includes only the loan balances of the remaining consumer banking portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and Poland).</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Asia Consumer for the third quarter of 2023 decreased quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher recoveries, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining consumer businesses, particularly Korea, and the reclassification of the portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 (subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023).</p>
<p>The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-overquarter and increased year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by lower loans due to the ongoing wind-downs.</p>
<p>| Mexico Consumer | Mexico Consumer |
| --- | --- |
| Mexico Consumer.jpg | |</p>
<p>Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer for the third quarter of 2023 increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss rates after peak losses experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter, driven by the sale of delinquent loans of a portfolio segment, and increased year-over-year, driven by the ongoing normalization of delinquency rates after peak delinquencies experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi's consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business's results of operations above and Note 13.</p>
<h2>U.S. Cards FICO Distribution</h2>
<p>The following tables present the current FICO score distributions for Citi's Branded cards and Retail services portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.</p>
<h2>Branded Cards</h2>
<p>| FICO distribution (1) | September 30, 2023 | June 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| &gt; 760 | 46 % | 47 % | 48 % |
| 680-760 | 39 | 38 | 38 |
| &lt; 680 | 15 | 15 | 14 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |</p>
<h2>Retail Services</h2>
<p>| FICO distribution (1) | September 30, 2023 | June 30, 2023 | September 30, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| &lt; 680 | 32 | 31 | 30 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |</p>
<p>The FICO distribution of both card portfolios declined slightly from the prior quarter and the prior year, reflecting the ongoing normalization in net credit loss and delinquency rates. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality and benefits from the continued impacts of prior government stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer relief programs. See Note 13 for additional information on FICO scores.</p>

<h2>Non-Accrual Loans and Assets</h2>
<p>For additional information on Citi's non-accrual loans and assets, see "NonAccrual Loans and Assets" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Non-Accrual Loans</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes Citigroup's non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.</p>
<p>Citi's non-accrual loans increased $695 million, or 27%, from June 30, 2023, primarily driven by the downgrade of two corporate loans in North America and EMEA.</p>

<p>Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.</p>
<p>The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup's operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup's consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. The decrease in Citi's average HQLA from the second quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by the reduction in the Available cash component of average HQLA, due to a reduction in deposits.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup had approximately $937 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($558 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($203 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi's HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($176 billion).</p>
<p>Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi's major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi's LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | Sept. 30, 2023 | | Jun. 30, 2023 Sept. 30, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HQLA | $ 569.3 | $ 583.8 | $ 557.1 |
| Net outflows | 485.3 | 491.9 | 477.0 |
| LCR | 117 % | 119 % | 117 % |
| HQLA in excess of net outflows | $ 84.0 | $ 91.9 | $ 80.1 |</p>
<p>Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup's average LCR decreased 2% from the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by the reduction in the Available cash component of average HQLA, due to a reduction in deposits.</p>
<p>In addition, considering Citi's total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $937 billion, Citi maintained approximately $452 billion of excess liquidity above the stressed average net outflow of approximately $485 billion, shown in the LCR table above.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)</h2>
<p>As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a rule to assess the availability of a bank's stable funding against a required level.</p>
<p>The rule became effective July 1, 2021, with public disclosure of the NSFR required on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi made the required disclosure and was in compliance with the rule as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Select Balance Sheet Items</h2>
<p>This section provides details of select liquidity-related assets and liabilities reported on Citigroup's Consolidated Balance Sheet on an average and end-ofperiod basis.</p>
<h2>Cash and Investments</h2>
<p>The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and due from banks , Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and Investment securities . Citi's investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. At September 30, 2023, Citi's EOP cash and Investment securities comprised approximately 32% of Citigroup's total assets:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | 3Q23 | 2Q23 | 3Q22 |

| Total Citigroup cash and Investment securities (AVG) | $ 796 | $ 846 | $ 801 |
| Total Citigroup cash and Investment securities (EOP) | $ 763 | $ 804 | $ 808 |</p>
<h2>Deposits</h2>
<p>The table below details the average deposits, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | 3Q23 | 2Q23 | 3Q22 |

| Total | $ 821 | $ 837 | $ 817 |
| Legacy Franchises | $ 52 | $ 51 | $ 50 |
| Corporate/Other | $ 21 | $ 19 | $ 21 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (AVG) | $ 1,315 | $ 1,338 | $ 1,316 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (EOP) | $ 1,274 | $ 1,320 | $ 1,306 |</p>
<p>Citi's deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies.</p>
<p>On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a modest increase in Legacy Franchises was offset by a decline in PBWM , and declined 2% sequentially. The increase in Legacy Franchises average deposits year-over-year was primarily driven by the impact of FX translation in Mexico Consumer/SBMM. PBWM average deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in investments on Citi's platform. ICG and Corporate/Other average deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in average deposits was largely driven by Services, reflecting the impact of monetary tightening.</p>
<p>End-of-period deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, largely due to a reduction in Services, reflecting monetary tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in Global Wealth and a reduction of institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. End-of-period deposits decreased 4% sequentially, driven by ICG , PBWM and Legacy Franchises , partially offset by Corporate/Other .</p>
<p>The majority of Citi's $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately $782 billion), and span approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15-year relationship with Citi. On an average basis, TTS grew deposits year-over-year at a faster rate than total Citi. Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth end-of-period deposits, which are diversified across the Private bank, Citigold, Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of August 2023, approximately 80% of U.S. Citigold deposit balances are with clients who have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 60% of Private bank ultra-high-net-worth deposit balances are with clients who have been with Citi for more than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking deposits are spread across six core urban centers.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Debt</h2>
<h2>Weighted Average Maturity (WAM)</h2>
<p>The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates' (including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt issued with a remaining life greater than one year:</p>
<p>| WAM in years | Sept. 30, 2023 | Jun. 30, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured debt | 7.4 | 7.7 | 7.8 |
| Non-bank benchmark debt | 7.1 | 7.3 | 7.4 |
| Customer-related debt | 8.2 | 8.2 | 8.6 |
| TLAC-eligible debt | 8.7 | 8.9 | 9.1 |</p>
<p>The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity where the option is not held by the issuer, the WAM is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Debt Outstanding</h2>
<p>Citi's long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customerrelated debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi's issuance of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi's non-bank entities. Citi's long-term debt at the bank includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.</p>
<p>The following table presents Citi's end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | Sept. 30, 2023 | Jun. 30, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2022 |

<ul>
<li>broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of September 30, 2023, non-bank included $90.6 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi's broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Citi's total long-term debt outstanding increased 9% year-over-year, largely driven by issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities, as well as lower securitizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding was largely unchanged, reflecting a decline in customer-related debt at the non-bank, offset by an increase in senior benchmark debt at the bank.</p>
<p>As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi's overall funding costs. During the third quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.</p>

<h2>Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings</h2>
<p>Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.</p>
<h2>Secured Funding Transactions</h2>
<p>Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi's bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi's secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions. Secured funding of $257 billion as of September 30, 2023 increased 27% year-over-year, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2023, on an average basis, secured funding was $275 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as "matched book" activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other "matched book" activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Borrowings</h2>
<p>Citi's short-term borrowings of $43 billion as of the third quarter of 2023 decreased 9% year-over-year and increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher commercial paper (see Note 17 for further information on Citigroup's and its affiliates' outstanding short-term borrowings).</p>
<h2>Credit Ratings</h2>
<p>The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of September 30, 2023. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch, A2/P-1 at Moody's Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&amp;P Global Ratings as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Ratings as of September 30, 2023</h2>
<p>| | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Long-term | Short-term | Outlook | Long- term | Short- term | Outlook |

| S&amp;P Global Ratings (S&amp;P) | BBB+ | A-2 | Stable | A+ | A-1 | Stable |</p>
<h2>Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades</h2>
<p>Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody's or S&amp;P could negatively impact Citigroup's and/or Citibank's funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.</p>
<p>For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see "Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks" and "Credit Ratings" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Citigroup Inc. and Citibank-Potential Derivative Triggers</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.</p>
<p>In total, as of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.7 billion, compared to $0.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 (see also Note 19). As detailed under "High-Quality Liquid Assets" above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.</p>
<h2>Citibank-Additional Potential Impacts</h2>
<p>In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank's senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, which was largely unchanged from June 30, 2023 (see Note 20 for additional information).</p>
<p>In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.</p>
<h2>MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Market risk arises from both Citi's trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see "Market Risk-Overview" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios</h2>
<p>Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi's net interest income and on Citi's Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital invested in foreign currencies.</p>
<h2>Banking Book Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>For interest rate risk purposes, Citi's non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi's Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management's Asset &amp; Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi's risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup's Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the dayto-day management of Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.</p>
<p>Changes in interest rates impact Citi's net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi's Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments;</li>
<li>· Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;</li>
<li>· Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and</li>
<li>· Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their ongoing activities, Citi's businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi's funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi's desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi's Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi's net interest income.</p>
<p>The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi's balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi's modeling and other factors.</p>
<p>Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain assumptions. The changes included, among other things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably accrual positions in ICG 's Markets businesses). These changes resulted in a higher impact to Citi's net interest income over a 12-month period.</p>
<p>Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts.</p>
<p>Citi's IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi's deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.</p>
<p>In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. EVS is a net present value (NPV)-based measure of the lifetime cash flows of Citi's Banking Book. It estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book's economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter-term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk limits approved by Citigroup's Board of Directors that are aligned with Citi's risk appetite.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios-Impact on AOCI</h2>
<p>Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI , which can in turn impact Citi's common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi's CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.</p>
<p>AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential</p>
<p>changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi's capital generation capacity.</p>
<p>Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted | Sept. 30, 2023 | Jun. 30, 2023 | Sept. 30, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Interest rate exposure (1) | | | |
| U.S. dollar | $ 82 | $ (55) | 677 |
| All other currencies | 1,214 | 1,468 | 1,483 |
| Total | $ 1,296 | $ 1,413 | 2,160 |
| As a percentage of average interest-earning assets | | 0.06 % 0.06 | 0.10 % |
| Estimated initial negative impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2) | $ (807) | $ (1,416) | (969) |
| Estimated initial impact on CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario | | (12) (12) | (9) |</p>
<p>The All other currencies of $1,214 million as of September 30, 2023 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, Indian rupee and British pound sterling. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.</p>
<p>Citi's balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of the third quarter of 2023 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to changes in deposit composition and levels, partially offset by hedging actions. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi's IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi's estimated IRE.</p>
<p>In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $0.8 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders' equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi's investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately four months.</p>
<h2>Scenario Analysis</h2>
<p>The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of September 30, 2023. The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products.</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 | Scenario 5 | Scenario 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overnight rate change (bps) | 100 | 100 | - | - | (100) | (100) |
| 10-year rate change (bps) | 100 | - | 100 | (100) | - | (100) |
| Interest rate exposure | | | | | | |
| U.S. dollar | $ 82 | $ 16 | $ 56 | $ (83) $ | (504) $ | (608) |
| All other currencies (1) | 1,214 | 1,034 | 176 | (179) | (916) | (1,081) |
| Total | $ 1,296 | $ 1,050 | $ 232 | $ (262) $ | (1,420) | $ (1,689) |
| Estimated initial impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2) | $ (807) | $ (1,008) | $ 245 | $ (445) $ | 995 | $ 645 |
| Estimated initial impact to CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario | (12) | (8) | (3) | 2 | 8 | 11 |</p>
<p>Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi's Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi's flooring assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi's investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi's pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.</p>
<h2>Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates-Impacts on AOCI and Capital</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi's tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.7 billion, or 0.96%, as a result of changes to Citi's CTA in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.</p>
<p>This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency</p>
<p>translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi's net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi's risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.</p>
<p>This, coupled with Citi's foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi's CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.</p>
<p>The effect of Citi's ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi's TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for additional information on the changes in AOCI .</p>

| Non- ICG Markets net interest income-taxable equivalent basis (1) | $ 12,273 $ | 11,930 $ | 11,379 | 8 % |</p>
<p>Citi's net interest income in the third quarter of 2023 increased 10% to $13.8 billion versus the prior-year period. As presented in the table above, Citi's net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis also increased 10% year-over-year, or $1.2 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest income in nonICG Markets, which increased 8%, and ICG Markets, which increased 28%. The increase in net interest income in nonICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest rates and growth in U.S. cards interestearning balances, partially offset by a reduction in net interest income due to the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy Franchises . The increase in ICG Markets net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.</p>
<p>Citi's net interest margin was 2.49% on a taxable equivalent basis in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 1 basis point from the prior quarter, primarily driven by beneficial balance sheet mix changes and higher interest rates, largely offset by the absence of the benefit of dividend seasonality in ICG Markets in the prior quarter.</p>

<h2>Market Risk of Trading Portfolios</h2>
<h2>Value at Risk (VAR)</h2>
<p>Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and longterm (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of September 30, 2023, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 32% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2023, the add-on was 48%.</p>
<p>As presented in the table below, Citi's average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2023 decreased 13% quarter-over-quarter, primarily from inventory changes in ICG Markets businesses and updates to reflect changes in volatilities.</p>

<h2>Regulatory VAR Back-testing</h2>
<p>In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.</p>
<p>Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi's VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, there were two back-testing exceptions observed for Citi's Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.</p>
<h2>OTHER RISKS</h2>
<p>For additional information regarding other risks, including Citi's management of other risks, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Country Risk</h2>
<h2>Top 25 Country Exposures</h2>
<p>The following table presents Citi's top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2023. (Including the U.S., Citi's top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 98% of Citi's exposure to all countries as of September 30, 2023.)</p>
<p>For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries,</p>
<p>most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (39% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 89% of the total U.K. funded loans and 90% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.</p>

<h2>Russia</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Russia, Citi's remaining operations are conducted through both ICG and Legacy Franchises .</p>
<p>As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi has significantly reduced its Legacy Franchises loan portfolio in Russia since September 2022, largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as support its employees, during this period. For additional information, see "Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations" below.</p>
<p>Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.</p>
<p>For additional information about Citi's risks related to its Russia exposures, see "Forward-Looking Statements" below and "Risk FactorsMarket-Related Risk," "-Operational Risks" and "-Other Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Impact of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine on Citi's Businesses</h2>

<p>During the third quarter of 2023, Citi's Russia-related exposures decreased by $0.7 billion, as shown in the table above. The decrease in exposure was driven by a $0.7 billion depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar. During the period, inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi's clients were fully offset by deposit outflows and tax payments to local authorities. Approximately 68% of Citi's remaining exposures in Russia are trapped dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which $3.5 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Citi's net investment in Russia was approximately $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 (down slightly from $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2023). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI . When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD equivalent value of Citigroup's investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net rubledenominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.</p>
<h2>Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi's Businesses</h2>
<p>Citi's ICG , PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and Corporate/Other have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi's businesses, see "Executive Summary" and each business's results of operations above.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citigroup's ACL included a $0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi's direct Russian counterparties (compared to $0.2 billion at June 30, 2023).</p>
<h2>Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations</h2>
<p>In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $55 million to-date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $85 million in estimated charges (approximately $10 million in ICG and $65 million in Legacy Franchises , and $10 million in Corporate/Other excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). This estimate was revised down during the third quarter from $180 million at June 30, 2023. During the third quarter, as part of the previously disclosed cards referral agreement with a Russian bank, approximately $26 million of credit card receivables was settled upon referral and refinanced. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and "Risk Factors" and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Deconsolidation Risk</h2>
<p>Citi's remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (for additional information, see "Risk Factors-Other Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of September 30, 2023, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.</p>
<p>In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi's foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately $1.0 billion (down slightly from $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2023) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.6 billion (compared to $0.4 billion as of June 30, 2023) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve.</p>
<h2>Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients</h2>
<p>Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi's role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions' sanctions laws.</p>
<p>These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or</p>
<p>block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.</p>
<h2>Reputational Risks</h2>
<p>Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi's response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi's reputation with some or all of these parties.</p>
<p>For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its current presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi's inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi's actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi's activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi established a Russia Special Review Process with management's Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian nexus.</p>
<p>While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi's reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures.</p>
<p>Citi's continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see "Risk Factors-Operational Risk" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Board's Role in Overseeing Related Risks</h2>
<p>The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board's Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi's operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as the war's broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi's risk exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has also provided updates to Citi's Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding Citi's Russia-related risks, including with respect to cybersecurity matters.</p>
<h2>Ukraine</h2>
<p>Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi's top priority. All of Citi's domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. Citi's exposures in Ukraine are not significant enough to be included in the "Top 25 Country Exposures" table above. As of September 30, 2023, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared to $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2023. The increase in exposures reflected a $0.2 billion increase in deposits.</p>
<h2>Argentina</h2>
<p>Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of September 30, 2023, Citi's net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.9 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2023). Under U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)denominated assets directly in earnings. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations.</p>
<p>From Citi's total net investment in Argentina of approximately $1.9 billion, as of September 30, 2023, Citi's net ARS exposure was approximately $1.3 billion (compared to $1.6 billion at June 30, 2023). The net ARS exposure has decreased as a result of Citi purchasing an additional approximate $200 million of certain local government bonds during the third quarter (for a total of $500 million in these bonds). These bonds are indexed to the higher of the U.S. dollar (USD) exchange rate or the local inflation index. Citi also originated approximately $50 million of USD-denominated loans during the third quarter. Such bonds and USD-denominated loans may reduce the impact to Citi of a potential currency devaluation in the future, although it remains unclear how effective Citi's strategies to reduce its ARS exposure may be.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi's ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. As a result, Citi's net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to continue to increase as Citi generates net income in its Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted. Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina's official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure Citi's net monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. Citibank Argentina therefore uses Argentina's official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS assets into the U.S. dollar, which was 350.0 ARS to 1 U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2023. During the third quarter, the Central Bank of Argentina devalued the official exchange rate by 27%, resulting in an approximate $180 million net negative impact to Citi's net investment in the country. For additional information on this impact to Citi, see "Executive Summary" and " Institutional Clients Group " above.</p>
<p>If Argentina's official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur a significant loss on its capital in Argentina. Current macroeconomic conditions in the country, along with sustained high inflation, low international reserves held by the Central Bank of Argentina and the foreign currency policy decisions following the upcoming general presidential elections in Argentina, may result in an accelerated or steep depreciation of the official exchange rate in the near term. Citi cannot predict future fluctuations in Argentina's official market exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate in the future.</p>
<p>Citi may economically hedge foreign currency risk in its net ARSdenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of September 30, 2023, the international NDF market had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi's inability to economically hedge substantially all of its ARS exposure. Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure.</p>
<p>Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-tomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of September 30, 2023. However, Citi may need to record additional reserves in the future, resulting in higher ICG cost of credit, should there be an increase in transfer risk associated with its Argentine exposures. For additional information on Citi's emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>This section contains a summary of Citi's most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup's significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi's results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.</p>
<h2>Valuations of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities .</p>
<p>Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.</p>
<p>When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.</p>
<p>Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI .</p>
<p>Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI . Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.</p>
<p>For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthan-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.</p>
<p>The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi's own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi's fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 22 and 23 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)</h2>
<p>The table below presents Citi's allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and total ACL as of the third quarter of 2023. For information on the drivers of Citi's ACL build in the third quarter of 2023, see "3Q23 Changes in the ACL" below.

<p>Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and</p>
<p>other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets . These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi's ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&amp;S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over an R&amp;S timeframe. The R&amp;S forecast period for consumer and corporate credit exposures is eight quarters.</p>
<p>The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast scenarios-base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.</p>
<h2>Quantitative Component</h2>
<p>Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&amp;S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi's expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.</p>
<h2>Qualitative Component</h2>
<p>The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Normalization of portfolio performance and consumer behavior from low losses as a result of government stimulus and market liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
<li>· Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions</li>
<li>· Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law</li>
</ul>
<p>As of the third quarter of 2023, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL continued to decline quarter-over-quarter. The decline was primarily driven by releases of COVID-19-related uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio continues to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels and as risks are captured in the quantitative component of the ACL. These releases were partially offset by a build for</p>
<p>macroeconomic risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions in the corporate portfolio, including continued high interest rates.</p>
<h2>Macroeconomic Variables</h2>
<p>Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.</p>
<p>The tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 3Q22 to 3Q23:</p>
<p>| | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. unemployment | 4Q23 | 2Q24 | 4Q24 | 8-quarter average (1) | |
| Citi forecast at 3Q22 | 4.3 % | 4.0 % | 4.0 % | 4.0 | % |
| Citi forecast at 4Q22 | 4.7 | 4.5 | 4.4 | 4.4 | |
| Citi forecast at 1Q23 | 4.3 | 4.6 | 4.5 | 4.3 | |
| Citi forecast at 2Q23 | 4.1 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.3 | |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 3.9 | 4.3 | 4.4 | 4.2 | |</p>
<p>| | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. real GDP | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
| Citi forecast at 3Q22 | 0.6 % | 1.9 % | 2.7 % |
| Citi forecast at 4Q22 | 0.3 | 1.5 | 2.2 |
| Citi forecast at 1Q23 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 2Q23 | 1.3 | 0.7 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 2.1 | 1.0 | 2.0 |</p>
<p>Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 3Q23, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to decline in the last quarter of 2023 before recovering in 2024, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the eight-quarter forecast horizon, broadly returning to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<h2>Scenario Weighting</h2>
<p>Citi's ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios-base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi's downside scenario reflects a severe recession, including an elevated</p>
<p>average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&amp;S period, with a peak difference of 3.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2024 of 2.5%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Citi's ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of September 30, 2023, to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple macroeconomic scenarios. Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $4.8 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses.</p>
<p>This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>3Q23 Changes in the ACL</h2>
<p>As further discussed below, Citi's ending ACL balance for the third quarter of 2023 was $20.2 billion, compared to $20.1 billion as of June 30, 2023. The net build of $0.2 billion was primarily driven by growth in card balances in PBWM and corporate builds primarily related to specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, partially offset by improvement in key macroeconomic variable forecasts . Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of September 30, 2023. See Note 14 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans</h2>
<p>Citi's consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded cards and Retail services) in U.S. Personal Banking. Citi's total consumer ACLL build was $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards balances, resulting in a September 30, 2023 ACLL balance of $14.9 billion, or 3.95% of total funded consumer loans.</p>
<p>For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans decreased to 7.81% at September 30, 2023, due to macroeconomic improvement, compared to 7.86% at June 30, 2023. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.24% at September 30, 2023, compared to 1.28% at June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans</h2>
<p>Citi had a corporate ACLL build of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023. The build was primarily driven by specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, partially offset by improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts. The ACLL reserve balance increased by $0.1 billion to $2.7 billion, or 0.97% of total funded corporate loans.</p>
<h2>ACLUC</h2>
<p>Citi had an ACLUC release of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023, which reduced the ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities , to $1.8 billion. The release was primarily driven by changes in the corporate portfolio and improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.</p>
<h2>ACL on Other Financial Assets</h2>
<p>Citi's ending ACL balance on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the third quarter of 2023 was $0.8 billion, compared to $0.8 billion as of June 30, 2023. The net build of $0.1 billion was primarily driven by a deterioration in certain macroeconomic variable forecasts, primarily impacting other financial assets. See Note 14 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Capital Impact</h2>
<p>Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies' final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.</p>
<p>See Notes 1 and 14 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.</p>
<h2>Goodwill</h2>
<p>Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi's stock price.</p>
<p>At October 1, 2022, the fair value of two reporting units (Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM) ranged from 102% to 106% of their carrying values. The carrying values of the Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting units included approximately $1.5 billion and $1 billion of goodwill, respectively. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.</p>
<p>While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi's management implements its strategic refresh. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 15 for a further discussion of goodwill.</p>
<h2>Litigation Accruals</h2>
<p>See the discussion in Note 26 for information regarding Citi's policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies.</p>
<h2>INCOME TAXES</h2>
<h2>Effective Tax Rate</h2>
<p>| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars, except effective tax rate | | | | | | | |
| | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | |
| Income from continuing operations before income tax expense | $ 4,788 | | $ 4,394 | | $ 15,013 | $ 15,631 | |
| Provision for income taxes | 1,203 | | 879 | | 3,824 | 3,002 | |
| Effective tax rate | 25 | % | 20 | % | 25 % | 19 % | |</p>
<p>Citi's effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter of 2023 versus 20% in the third quarter of 2022, both including the impact of divestitures, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings. Citi recognized a third quarter of 2023 tax provision benefit of approximately $60 million related to tax law changes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Citi's effective tax rate increased to 25%, compared to 19% in the prior-year period, both including the impact of divestitures, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits.</p>
<h2>Deferred Tax Assets</h2>
<p>For additional information on Citi's deferred tax assets (DTAs), see "Capital Resources," "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Income Taxes" and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes Citi's net DTAs balance:</p>
<p>| Jurisdiction/Component | DTAs balance | DTAs balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| Total U.S. | $ 25.4 | $ 24.8 |
| Total foreign | 2.9 | 2.9 |
| Total | $ 28.3 | $ 27.7 |</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $28.3 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion from June 30, 2023 and an increase of $0.6 billion from December 31, 2022. The decrease for the third quarter was primarily from income in Other comprehensive income , and the year-to-date increase was primarily a result of Citi's geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi's $28.3 billion of net DTAs, $11.2 billion (compared to $11.7 billion at June 30, 2023) was deducted in calculating Citi's regulatory capital, and the remaining $17.1 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.</p>
<p>The $11.2 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.2 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $1.8 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.8 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.</p>
<h2>DTA Realizability</h2>
<p>Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of $28.3 billion at September 30, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on management's expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Citi's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Citi's Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi's disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.</p>
<p>Citi's management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT</h2>
<p>Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Citi, in its First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, identified and reported certain activities pursuant to Section 219 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Citi, in its Second Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, identified and reported certain activities pursuant to Section 219 for the second quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, Citigroup identified one transaction pursuant to Section 219.</p>
<p>On July 26, 2023, Citibank Europe plc, Czech Republic Branch, processed a payment to the Iranian Embassy in the Czech Republic for the payment of fees for a travel tourist visa. The total value of the payment was CZK 1,200.00 (approximately USD 51.80). Nominal fees were realized for the processing of this payment. This payment was permissible under the travel exemption of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations.</p>

<p>Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the precautionary statements included within the "Executive Summary" and each business's discussion and analysis of its results of operations above, in Citi's Second Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, in Citi's First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K and in Citi's other SEC filings; (ii) the factors listed and described under "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K; and (iii) the risks and uncertainties summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi from continued macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatility, including, among others, governmental fiscal and monetary actions or expected actions, including continued elevated interest rates, reductions in central bank balance sheets, or other restrictive interest rate or other monetary policies; potential recessions in the U.S., Europe and other regions and countries; a potential U.S. federal government shutdown and the resulting impacts; sustained elevated levels of inflation and their impacts; economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, including weak economic growth, driven in part by challenges in its real estate sector, and tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan and/or involving China and the U.S.; other geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related to Russia's war in Ukraine and potential escalation of the conflict in the Middle East; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; distress and volatility in emerging markets, including sovereign debt pricing; protracted or widespread trade tensions; and election outcomes;</li>
<li>· the potential impact on Citi's ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, due to, among other things: changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations,</li>
<li>such as revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules, including the recently issued notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame, related to regulatory capital requirements; annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer (increased effective as of October 1, 2023); recalibration of the GSIB surcharge; Citi's results of operations and financial condition, including the capital impact related to Citi's remaining consumer banking divestitures, and achievement of the expected benefits from the divestitures; Citi's effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio and GSIB surcharge; Citi's implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; and Citi's DTA utilization;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to improve its risk and controls environment, modernize its data and technology infrastructure and further enhance safety and soundness, meet regulatory expectations, be sufficiently competitive, serve clients effectively, avoid operational errors and realize productivity improvements, as part of its transformation and other priorities, including as a result of factors that Citi cannot control, which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement, and limit their effectiveness;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to achieve its objectives from its strategic and other initiatives, such as those related to its investment and simplification priorities, including, among others, achieving productivity improvements and expense</li>
<li>savings, minimizing disruptions to its businesses and managing the execution uncertainty and complexity associated with Citi's exit of Mexico Consumer/SBMM, which may not be as productive, effective or timely as Citi expects, and could result in CTA and other losses, charges or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi from climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy, including both physical risks, such as increased frequency and/or severity of adverse weather events as consequences of chronic climate changes, and transition risks, such as those arising from changes in regulations or market preferences toward a low-carbon economy; higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs and data-related challenges, including as a result of any new disclosure requirements; and an increased focus by banking regulators and others on the issue of climate change at financial institutions directly and with respect to their clients;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to utilize its DTAs (including the foreign tax credit component of its DTAs) and thus reduce the negative impact of the DTAs on Citi's regulatory capital, including as a result of its ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi if its interpretation or application of the complex income-based and non-income based (such as withholding, stamp, service and other non-income taxes) tax laws to which it is subject in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions differs from those of the relevant governmental taxing authorities, including as a result of litigation or examinations regarding non-income-based tax matters, and the resulting payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest;</li>
<li>· the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi's co-branding or private label credit card relationships, due to, among other things, the general economic environment; changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination of a particular relationship; or other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, whether due to the impact of a challenging economic environment or otherwise;</li>

<li>· the potential impact on Citi's performance and the performance of its individual businesses, including its competitive position and ability to effectively manage its businesses, and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives, if Citi is unable to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, particularly given the highly competitive environment for talent and other factors, such as potential attrition driven by Citi's simplification initiatives, low unemployment, changes in workers' expectations and</li>
<li>regulation of employee compensation in the banking industry;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and globally with both financial and non-financial services firms, including as a result of certain competitors being subject to less stringent legal and regulatory requirements; the introduction of new or emerging technologies and mobile platforms; possible disruptions from artificial intelligence-driven solutions; growth in digital asset markets; changes in the payments space; reliance on third parties for certain product and service offerings and impact if any third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings; and the increased operational, compliance and other risks resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt existing products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively with competitors;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi from a prior or future failure or disruption of its operational processes or systems, including as a result of, among other things, human error, such as manual transaction processing errors (e.g., erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by Citi traders that cause system and market disruptions and losses for Citi or its clients), which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; operational or execution failures or deficiencies by third parties; insufficient (or limited) straightthrough processing between legacy systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failure of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure; other similar losses or damage to Citi's property or assets; failures by third parties; potential disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi's businesses, as well as the operations of Citi's clients, customers or other third parties; and the increased financial, reputational, legal and compliance risks resulting from any such failure or disruption of operational processes or systems, including legal and regulatory actions or proceedings, fines and other costs;</li>
<li>· the increasing risk to Citi's and third parties' computer systems and networks from continually evolving, sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in, among other things, theft, loss, misuse or disclosure of confidential Citi, client or customer information or assets and a disruption of computer, software or network systems; and the potential impact from such risks, including reputational damage, regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, additional costs (including repair, remediation and other costs), exposure to litigation and other financial losses;</li>
<li>· the potential impact of changes or errors in accounting assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of certain accounting principles, related to the preparation of Citi's financial statements, including the estimate of Citi's ACL, which depends on its CECL models and</li>
<li>assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and characteristics of Citi's loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets; reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax matters exposures; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and liabilities; and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment;</li>
<li>· the financial impact from reclassification of any CTA component of AOCI , including related hedges and taxes, into Citi's earnings, due to a sale, IPO, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations or equity investments, such as those related to Citi's remaining consumer banking divestitures or other legacy businesses, whether due to Citi's strategic refresh or otherwise;</li>
<li>· the impact of changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations of how Citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi's results of operations and/or regulatory capital and capital ratios if Citi's risk management and mitigation processes, strategies or models, including those related to its comprehensive stress testing initiatives or ability to manage, assess and aggregate data, are deficient or ineffective, or Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models require refinement, modification or enhancement, or any related action is taken by Citi's U.S. banking regulators;</li>
<li>· the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of risk on Citi's results of operations, whether due to a default of or deterioration involving consumer, corporate or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, including from indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions, such as hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi's inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable industries or sectors impacted by the continued macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges and uncertainties and volatilities;</li>
<li>· the potential impact on Citi's liquidity and/or costs of funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity or due to various other factors, including, among others, general disruptions in the financial markets; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix, whether driven by migration to higher-yielding products, competition or otherwise, which could be exacerbated by the rapid spread of information via social or mainstream media; governmental fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory changes; negative investor perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; competition for funding, including a decrease in demand for corporate debt, unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; changes in Citi's credit spreads; higher interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;</li>
<li>· the impact of a credit ratings downgrade of Citi or certain of its subsidiaries or issuing entities on Citi's funding and liquidity as well as on the operations of certain of its businesses;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi of ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes in the U.S. and globally, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations for large financial institutions and their employees and agents, with respect to governance, infrastructure, data, climate and risk management practices and controls, customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering and increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes, including the impact on Citi's compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs, such as increased regulatory oversight and restrictions, enforcement proceedings, penalties and fines;</li>
<li>· the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the previously disclosed October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risk and controls, such as enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; Citi's ability to implement targeted actions plans and submit quarterly progress reports detailing the results and status of improvements to comply with the consent orders on a timely and sufficient basis, which will continue to require significant investments to meet regulatory expectations; and the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies that may be sought by regulators, such as significant monetary penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends, changes to directors and/or officers and collateral consequences to Citi arising from such outcomes; and</li>
<li>· the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in the emerging markets, including, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; sustained elevated interest rates and other restrictive monetary policies; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; sovereign debt volatility; election outcomes; regulatory changes and political events; foreign exchange controls, including the inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and uncertainties and volatility, including with respect to commodity prices as well as repricing of assets and resulting impacts; limitations on foreign investment; sociopolitical instability; civil unrest; crime, corruption and fraud; cyberattacks; nationalization or loss of licenses; business restrictions; sanctions or asset freezes; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; confiscation of assets, whether related to geopolitical conflicts or otherwise; the need to record additional reserves based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law; risks related to the ongoing wind-down of Citi's operations in Russia; and increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs.</li>

Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.</p>
<h2>UPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<p>The accounting policies below have been updated from those disclosed in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K for the effects of accounting standards adopted during the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K for a summary of all of Citigroup's significant accounting policies.</p>
<h2>Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)</h2>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures under the methodology described below. For information about Citi's accounting for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) prior to January 1, 2023, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>ACCOUNTING CHANGES</h2>
<h2>TDRs and Vintage Disclosures</h2>
<p>In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and measurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.</p>
<p>Adopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of $352 million and an increase in other assets related to held-for-sale businesses of $44 million, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $290 million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of $106 million on January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement approach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this ASU.</p>
<p>ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With the elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably expected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term over which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for modified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be based on the fair value of the collateral.</p>
<h2>Consumer Loans</h2>
<p>Upon adoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the use of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all consumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate discounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi collectively evaluates smaller-balance homogeneous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>credit losses, whereas previously those loans had been individually evaluated. The ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of those types of modifications. In addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to disclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 13 for these new disclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.</p>
<h2>Long-Duration Insurance Contracts</h2>
<p>In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial ServicesInsurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12.</p>
<p>Citi adopted the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $39 million decrease in Other liabilities and a $27 million increase in AOCI , after-tax.</p>
<h2>FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES</h2>
<h2>Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expands the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as components of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU will permit the Company to elect to use the proportional amortization method to account for all eligible tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, if certain conditions are met. Citi plans to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2024 and does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions</h2>
<p>In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions.</p>
<p>The ASU will be effective for Citi on January 1, 2024 and is not expected to have an impact on Citi's operating results or financial position.</p>

<li>DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITS</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Summary of Discontinued Operations</h2>
<p>The Company's results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/Other .</p>
<p>The following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations :</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2023 | | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Total revenues, net of interest expense | $ | - | $ - | $ - | $ (262) |
| Income (loss) from discontinued operations | $ | 2 | $ (6) | $ - | $ (270) |
| Benefit for income taxes | - | | - | - | (41) |
| Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes | $ | 2 | $ (6) | $ - | $ (229) |</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2022, the Company finalized the settlement of certain liabilities related to its legacy consumer operation in the U.K. (the legacy operation), including an indemnification liability related to its sale of the Egg Banking business in 2011, which led to the substantial liquidation of the legacy operation. As a result, a CTA loss (net of hedges) in AOCI of approximately $400 million pretax ($345 million after-tax) related to the legacy operation was released to earnings in the second quarter of 2022. Out of the total CTA release, a $260 million pretax loss ($221 million after-tax loss) was attributable to the Egg Banking business noted above, reported in Discontinued operations , and therefore the corresponding CTA release was also reported in Discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2022. The remaining CTA release of a $140 million pretax loss ($124 million aftertax loss) related to Legacy Holdings Assets was reported as part of Continuing operations within Legacy Franchises .</p>
<p>While the legacy operation was divested in multiple sales over the years, each transaction did not result in substantial liquidation given that Citi retained certain liabilities noted above, which were gradually settled over time until reaching the point of substantial liquidation during the second quarter of 2022, triggering the release of the CTA loss to earnings.</p>
<p>Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented.</p>
<h2>Significant Disposals</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, Citi had entered into sale agreements fornine consumer banking businesses within Legacy Franchises . Australia closed in the second quarter of 2022, the Philippines closed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, India and Vietnam closed in the first quarter of 2023 and Taiwan closed in the third quarter of 2023. Citi's entry of sale agreement for the Indonesia consumer banking business has resulted in the reclassification to HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $1 billion in assets within Other assets , including approximately $520 million of loans (net of allowance of $34 million), and approximately $1 billion in liabilities within Other liabilities , including approximately $900 million in deposits.</p>
<p>Of the nine sale agreements, the five below were identified as significant disposals. As of September 30, 2023, there were no remaining assets or liabilities included on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the significant disposals:</p>

<p>Citi did not have any other significant disposals as of September 30, 2023. As of November 3, 2023, Citi had not entered into sale agreements for the remaining Legacy Franchises businesses to be sold, specifically the Poland consumer banking business and the Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses.</p>

<h2>Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking Businesses</h2>
<p>On August 25, 2022, Citi announced its decision to wind down its consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the wind-down, Citi is also actively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking portfolios.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it would end nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi's only operations in Russia are those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<h2>Portfolio Sales</h2>
<ul>
<li>· On December 12, 2022, Citi completed the sale of a portfolio of rubledenominated personal installment loans, totaling approximately $240 million in outstanding loan balances, to Uralsib, a Russian commercial bank, resulting in a pretax net loss of approximately $12 million. The net loss on sale of the loan portfolio included a $32 million adjustment to record the loans at lower of cost or fair value recognized in Other revenue. In addition, the sale of the loans resulted in a release in the allowance for credit losses on loans of approximately $20 million recognized in the Provision for credit losses on loans .</li>
<li>· During the second quarter of 2023, Citi recorded an incremental gain of $5 million related to post-closing contingency payments for the previously disclosed personal installment loan sale in Other revenue.

<li>OPERATING SEGMENTS</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.</p>
<p>Citigroup's activities are conducted throughthree operating segments: Institutional Clients Group (ICG) , Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) and Legacy Franchises , with Corporate/Other including activities not assigned to a specific operating segment, as well as discontinued operations.</p>
<p>ICG consists of Services, Markets and Banking, providing corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services.</p>
<p>PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth), providing traditional banking services and credit cards to retail and small business customers primarily in the U.S., and financial services to clients from affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through banking, lending, mortgages, investment, custody and trust product offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and the four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London.</p>
<p>Legacy Franchises consists of Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses that Citi intends to exit, and its remaining Legacy Holdings Assets .</p>
<p>Corporate/Other includes activities not assigned to the operating segments, including certain unallocated costs of global functions, other corporate expenses and corporate treasury results, offsets to certain line-item reclassifications and eliminations and unallocated taxes, as well as discontinued operations.</p>
<p>Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from Corporate/Other based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.</p>
<p>As a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components being treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, the Company includes intersegment eliminations within Corporate/Other to reconcile the business segment results to Citi's consolidated results.</p>
<p>The accounting policies of these operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>On September 13, 2023, Citi announced changes to its organizational structure, with the resulting operating segment impacts being implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company continues to execute requisite system and process changes that will enable the new segments to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2023. Citi expects to update its operating segment disclosures, including historical financial results, in the fourth quarter of 2023. These changes will not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results of the Company.</p>

<li>PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading activities' profitability (see Note 4 for information about net interest income related to trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 22.</p>
<p>In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.</p>
<p>The following table presents Principal transactions revenue:</p>

<h2>HTM Debt Securities Delinquency and Non-Accrual Details</h2>

<h2>Evaluating Investments for Impairment-AFS Debt Securities</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company's intent to sell such securities.</p>
<p>For more information on evaluating investments for impairment, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Recognition and Measurement of Impairment</h2>
<p>The following table presents total impairment on AFS investments recognized in earnings:</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |

| nor will likely be required to sell: | | | | |
| Total impairment losses recognized during the period | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ - |

| Net impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell | $ - | $ - | $ - | $ - |
| Impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company intends to sell, would more-likely-than-not be required to sell or will be subject | | | | |
| to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise | 43 | 74 | 137 | 254 |
| Total impairment losses recognized in earnings | $ 43 | $ 74 | $ 137 | $ 254 |</p>
<h2>Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities</h2>
<p>The allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was $5 million and $3 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<h2>Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at</h2>
<h2>Fair Value</h2>
<p>Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.</p>
<p>The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.</p>
<p>Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to fair value through earnings.</p>
<p>Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at September 30, 2023 and De cember 31, 2022 :</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |

<h2>Corporate Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi's exposure to loss, often providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to the borrower's individual circumstances. The following table details corporate loan modifications granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications. Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan classified as substandard or worse at the time of modification.</p>

<h2>Consumer Loans</h2>
<p>Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM). The tables below present details about these loans, including the following loan categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans primarily represent secured mortgage lending to customers of Retail banking and Global Wealth.</li>
<li>· Credit cards primarily represent unsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded cards and Retail services.</li>
<li>· Personal, small business and other loans are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to customers of Global Wealth (mostly within the Private bank) who are typically high credit quality borrowers that historically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized in the form of liquid securities and other forms of collateral.</li>

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $0 million and $337 million of consumer loans, respectively. The increase was due to the reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2022.

<h2>Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)</h2>
<p>The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi's U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available. With respect to Citi's consumer loan portfolio outside of the U.S. as of September 30, 2023 and</p>
<p>December 31, 2022 ($76.8 billion and $80.5 billion, respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of customers (for additional information on loans outside of the U.S., see "Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America" below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.</p>

<h2>Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral, and ultimately maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi's significant consumer modification programs are described below.</p>
<h2>Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers' entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi's standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.</p>
<h2>Residential Mortgages</h2>
<p>Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower's formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $12 million and $22 million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. Mortgage loans of $4 million and $6 million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Types of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect</h2>

<h2>3Q23 Changes in the ACL</h2>
<p>The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments as of September 30, 2023 was $19,435 million, a slight increase from $19,125 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACLL was primarily driven by growth in card balances in Branded cards and Retail services and an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by a decrease in the ACLL of $352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs (see Note 1) and improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.</p>
<h2>Consumer ACLL</h2>
<p>Citi's total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) as of September 30, 2023 was $14,912 million, an increase from $14,119 million at December 31, 2022.

<h2>Corporate ACLL</h2>
<p>Citi's total corporate ACLL as of September 30, 2023 was $2,717 million, a decrease from $2,855 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.</p>

<p>Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of September 30, 2023. For additional information regarding Citi's goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi's management implements its strategic refresh. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.</p>

<h2>The previous tables do not include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;</li>
<li>· certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company's maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company's maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions was $13.8 billion and $33.6 billion, respectively (for more information on these positions, see Note 13 and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K);</li>
<li>· certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm's-length terms;</li>
<li>· certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and 21 for more information on these positions);</li>
<li>· certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and</li>
<li>· VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company's funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.</p>
<p>The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.</p>
<p>The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company's investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, crosscurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.</p>
<p>The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include thirdparty assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.</p>

<h2>Consumer Loan Securitizations</h2>
<p>Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Citi relaunched a program securitizing other consumer loans into asset-backed securities. The principal securitized and the proceeds from new securitizations at September 30, 2023 were $0.5 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The gain recognized on the securitization of consumer loans was $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)</h2>
<p>The fair value of Citi's capitalized MSRs was $729 million and $647 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $52 billion and $48 billion as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Balance, beginning of period | $ 681 | $ 600 | $ 665 $ | 404 |
| Originations | 23 | 25 | 54 | 94 |
| Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions | 42 | 37 | 61 | 195 |
| Other changes (1) | (17) | (15) | (51) | (46) |
| Balance, as of September 30 | $ 729 $ | 647 | $ 729 $ | 647 |</p>
<p>The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets .</p>
<p>The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Servicing fees | $ 32 | $ 31 | $ 97 | $ 90 |
| Late fees | 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Total MSR fees | $ 33 | $ 32 | $ 100 | $ 93 |</p>
<p>In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as Commissions and fees , and changes in MSR fair values are classified as Other revenue .</p>
<h2>Re-securitizations</h2>
<p>The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi heldno retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.</p>
<p>The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $4.3 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively, to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $5.3 billion and $20.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $1.4 billion (including $552 million r elated to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 (including $801 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were approximately $85.9 billion and $79.4 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.</p>
<h2>Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $20.9 billion and $19.6 billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $15.6 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 68 and 64 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi's internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit's assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The net result across multiseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company owned $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company's investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.</p>
<h2>Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $0.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which $0.3 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed.</p>
<p>The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.</p>
<h2>Asset-Based Financing</h2>
<p>The primary types of Citi's asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi's maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.</p>

<li>DERIVATIVES</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi's use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10K.</p>
<p>Information pertaining to Citigroup's derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi's exposure to derivative transactions. Citi's derivative exposure arises primarily from</p>
<p>market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.</p>
<p>In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi's market share, levels of client activity and other factors.</p>

<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company's derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.</p>
<p>In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.</p>

<h2>Cumulative Basis Adjustment</h2>
<p>Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi's hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.</p>

| Long-term debt | 144,549 | (5,040) | (3,399) |</p>
<h2>Cash Flow Hedges</h2>
<p>Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of September 30, 2023 is approximately $(1.0) billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 15 years.</p>
<p>The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note 18.</p>

<h2>Net Investment Hedges</h2>
<p>Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup's equity investments in several nonU.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI .</p>
<p>The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $363 million and $(586) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $812 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 include a $1 million pretax gain and $46 million pretax loss related to net investment hedges, respectively, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings (recorded in Other revenue ).</p>

<h2>Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives</h2>
<p>Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.</p>
<p>The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $15 billion and $18 billion, respectively. The Company posted $13 billion and $15 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of September 30, 2023, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.7 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $4 million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.7 billion.</p>
<h2>Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers</h2>
<p>For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $2.2 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of September 30, 2023 was $3 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $52 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.4 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $27 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.</p>
<p>The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.</p>

<li>FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>For additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Hierarchy</h2>
<p>ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.</li>
<li>· Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in the market.</li>
<li>· Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable .</li>
</ul>
<p>As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible.</p>
<p>The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data-driven selection criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>· The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based upon the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date.</li>
<li>· A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.</li>
<li>· Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Market Valuation Adjustments</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:</p>
<p>| | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| Counterparty CVA | $ (589) $ | (816) |

<h2>Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis</h2>
<p>The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company may hedge</p>
<p>positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables:</p>

<h2>Level 3 Fair Value Transfers</h2>
<p>The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>· During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, transfers of Long-term debt were $1.0 billion and $4.2 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. Of the $4.2 billion transfer, approximately $3.6 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.6 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $1.3 billion and $7.4 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.</li>

<p>The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>· During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, transfers of Long-term debt were $2.8 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $9.6 billion transfer in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, approximately $6.8 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $2.8 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $0.8 billion and $4.3 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.</li>

<h2>Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis</h2>
<p>Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.</p>

<li>FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI .</p>
<p>The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 20 for additional details on Citi's MSRs. Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 22.</p>
<p>The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:</p>

<h2>Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)</h2>
<p>Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi's credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 18 for additional information.</p>
<p>Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company's credit spreads.</p>
<p>The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company's own credit spread (or instrumentspecific credit risk) were a gain of $395 million and a gain of $1,159 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a loss of $(875) million and a gain of $4,800 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company's current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.</p>
<h2>The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</h2>
<p>Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:</p>
<p>| | September 30, 2023 | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | Trading assets | Loans | Trading assets | Loans |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 4,340 $ | 7,411 | 6,011 | $ 5,360 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | 120 | 60 | 167 | 51 |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | 1 | - | 2 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | 1 | - | - |</p>
<p>Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<h2>Certain Loans and Other Credit Products</h2>
<p>Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup's lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.</p>
<p>In addition to the amounts reported above, $541 million and $729 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $(27) million and $(69) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrumentspecific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.</p>
<h2>Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi's receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.</p>
<h2>Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)</h2>
<p>Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 551 $ | 793 |
| Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance | (17) | (10) |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | 3 | 1 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | - |</p>
<p>The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrumentspecific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<h2>Certain Debt Liabilities</h2>
<p>The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt or Short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of risk:</p>
<p>| In billions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |

<p>The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions . Changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions .</p>

<h2>Loans Sold with Recourse</h2>
<p>In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $11 million and $10 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>For additional information on Citi's loans sold with recourse, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Credit Card Arrangements with Partners</h2>
<p>Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement. To the extent that such origination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations.</p>
<h2>Other Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<h2>Credit Card Protection Programs</h2>
<p>Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi's maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi's obligations related to these programs were immaterial.</p>
<h2>Value-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs)</h2>
<p>Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member's default on its obligations. Citi's potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN's funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi's participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 for potential obligations that could arise from Citi's involvement with VTN associations.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance Indemnification</h2>
<p>Citi has an indemnification contingency to Brighthouse Financial in connection with Citi's sale of an insurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification agreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial would become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when both the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust assets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However, should events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and trust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse Financial's LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to either estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to accrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and estimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional information, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing</h2>
<p>Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 21 for a discussion of Citi's derivatives activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.</p>
<p>There are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.</p>
<p>However, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi's bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was</p>
<p>approximately $17.3 billion and $18.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client's derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client's derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client's positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi's credit risk in the event the client fails to perform.</p>
<p>As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>FICC Sponsored Member Repo Program</h2>
<p>Citi acts as a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) to clear eligible resale and repurchase agreements on behalf of its clients that become sponsored members of the FICC. Citi, as sponsoring member, is required to provide a guarantee to the FICC with respect to the prompt payment and performance of its sponsored members. Because Citi obtains a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house, Citi expects the risk of loss from this guarantee to be remote. See Note 10 for additional information on Citi's resale and repurchase agreements, including risk mitigation practices for these transactions.</p>
<h2>Carrying Value-Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities .</p>
<h2>Collateral</h2>
<p>Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $49.8 billion and $51.8 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $76.3 billion and $63.7 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.</p>
<h2>Performance Risk</h2>
<p>Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.</p>
<p>| | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars at September 30, 2023 | | Investment grade | Non-investment grade | Not rated | Total |

| Other | | - | 8.5 | - | 8.5 |
| Total | $ | 77.9 $ | 18.9 $ | 3.0 $ | 99.8 |</p>
<h2>Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit</h2>
<p>The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes Citigroup's credit commitments:</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars | U.S. | Outside of U.S. (1) | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial and similar letters of credit | $ 659 | $ 4,549 | 5,208 $ | 5,316 |
| One- to four-family residential mortgages | 756 | 687 | 1,443 | 2,394 |
| Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties | 5,553 | 25 | 5,578 | 6,380 |
| Commercial real estate, construction and land development | 13,451 | 2,045 | 15,496 | 15,170 |
| Credit card lines | 614,535 | 64,459 | 678,994 | 683,232 |
| Commercial and other consumer loan commitments | 205,749 | 108,703 | 314,452 | 297,399 |
| Other commitments and contingencies (2) | 5,381 | 105 | 5,486 | 5,673 |
| Total | $ 846,084 | $ 180,573 | 1,026,657 $ | 1,015,564 |</p>
<h2>Other Commitments</h2>
<p>As a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $4.5 billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, Citi enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi had approximately $143.9 billion and $111.6 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $108.7 billion and $37.3 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 10 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company's policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.</p>
<p>These amounts are not included in the table above.</p>
<h2>Restricted Cash</h2>
<p>Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers' primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority.</p>
<p>Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cash and due from banks | $ 4,150 | $ 4,820 |
| Deposits with banks, net of allowance | 14,786 | 12,156 |
| Total | $ 18,936 | $ 16,976 |</p>
<p>In addition to the restricted cash amounts presented above, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, was held at the Deposit Insurance Agency and was subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. These restricted amounts are reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<ol>
<li>LEASES</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The Company's operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding Citi's leases, see Notes 1 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities , respectively:</p>
<p>| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ROU asset | $ 2,787 | 2,892 |
| Lease liability | 2,974 | 3,076 |</p>
<p>The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.</p>

<li>CONTINGENCIES</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosure in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup's Second Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q and in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.</p>
<p>In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.</p>
<p>If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At September 30, 2023, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate.</p>
<p>As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.</p>
<p>Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup's management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.</p>
<p>For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup's accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>FDIC Special Assessment</h2>
<p>On May 11, 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a special assessmentprimarily upon large banks-to recover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC estimated that of the cost of the failures, approximately $15.8 billion was attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors, an estimate that will be periodically adjusted. The FDIC has proposed collecting the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured U.S. deposits over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 2024. There is sufficient uncertainty around the final FDIC regulation that would impact both the timing and amount. If the final rule for the FDIC special assessment, which is expected before the end of 2023, is enacted as proposed, Citi is likely to incur up to a $1.5 billion pretax charge, impacting operating expenses. This amount is not included in the reasonably possible loss estimate above.</p>

Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 19-CV-1608 (S.D.N.Y.) (Furman, J.) and 23-7328 (2d Cir.).</p>
<p>Since April 2018, Citigroup and certain of its affiliates, including Citibank and CGMI, have been named in state court qui tam lawsuits in which Edelweiss Fund, LLC alleges that Citi and other financial institutions defrauded certain state municipal variable rate demand obligation ("VRDO") issuers in connection with resetting VRDO interest rates. Filed under each state's respective false claims act, these actions are pending in state courts in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York, and are captioned STATE OF CALIFORNIA EX REL. EDELWEISS FUND v. JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO., ET AL., STATE OF ILLINOIS EX REL. EDELWEISS FUND v. JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO., ET AL., STATE OF NEW JERSEY EX REL. EDELWEISS FUND v.

<h2>Settlement Payments</h2>
<p>Payments required in any settlement agreements described above have been made or are covered by existing litigation or other accruals.</p>
<ol>
<li>SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Citigroup Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities</p>
<p>to the extent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.'s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 17 for additional information). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.</p>
<p>Summarized financial information for Citigroup Inc. and CGMHI is presented in the tables below:</p>

<p>As previously announced, Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>Citi paid common dividends of $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2023, and on October 19, 2023, declared common dividends of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common dividend of at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors' approval.</p>
<p>As discussed above, Citi's ability to pay common stock dividends is subject to limitations on capital distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such restrictions based on the extent to which the buffers are breached. For additional information, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Buffers" and "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks" in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Any dividend on Citi's outstanding common stock would also need to be in compliance with Citi's obligations on its outstanding preferred stock. On October 19, 2023, Citi declared preferred dividends of approximately $300 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>For information on the ability of Citigroup's subsidiary depository institutions to pay dividends, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2022 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>Amendments to By-laws</h2>
<p>On November 1, 2023, Citi's Board of Directors amended Citi's By-laws (the By-laws), effective as of such date, to enhance procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements in connection with shareholder nominations of directors (or proposals of business other than nominations at an annual meeting not brought pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8), including by: (i) amending Section 11 of Article III to require a stockholder desiring to nominate directors to make a representation confirming that such stockholder will, or is part of a group that will, solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Citi's nominees in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-19, or whether it will otherwise solicit proxies in support of director nominees (or a proposal, in the case of business other than nominations at an annual meeting); (ii) amending Section 11 of Article III to require a stockholder desiring to nominate directors (or propose business other than nominations at an annual meeting) to make a representation that it will provide Citi documents demonstrating that it has delivered a proxy statement and form to the holders of a percentage of Citi's stock consistent with the stockholder's representation to Citi; (iii) amending Section 13 of Article III to require nominating or proposing stockholders who are entities to satisfy certain informational requirements with respect to the individuals who directly or indirectly control (but are not passive investors in) such entities; (iv) amending Section 11 of Article III to require that any stockholder desiring to nominate directors at a special meeting for director elections must comply with the advance notice information requirements applicable at annual meetings; (v) amending Section 11 of Article III to require that a stockholder seeking to propose business other than nominations at an annual meeting must include the text of any proposed resolution or by-law amendment; (vi) amending Sections 11 and 12 of Article III to provide that Citi has ten days to provide the nominee questionnaire to a stockholder upon request, which would require a stockholder to approach Citi with such a request more than ten days prior to the end of the applicable nomination window to ensure the nomination is timely submitted; (vii) amending Section 11 to Article III to clarify that, with the adoption of SEC Rule 14a-19, Citi's proxy access by-law is no longer the exclusive means for stockholder nominees to be included on Citi's proxy card; (viii) amending Section 11 of Article III to prohibit a stockholder soliciting proxies from using the whitecolored proxy card; and (ix) amending Section 11 of Article III to clarify that a nominating or proposing stockholder's failure to provide the required information or comply with the applicable By-law requirements (including compliance with the applicable SEC rules) will result in a stockholder's nomination or proposal of other business being disregarded.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced Approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk weightings, which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.

Accordingly, the Standardized Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual economic risks that banks are facing.</p>
<p>Structured notes: Financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives.

GAAP measures on taxable equivalent basis, including the metrics derived from these measures, are non-GAAP financial measures.</p>

Prior to January 1, 2023, a TDR was deemed to occur when the Company modified the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty.

<p>U.S. government agencies: U.S. government agencies include, but are not limited to, agencies such as Ginnie Mae and FHA, and do not include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (U.S. GSEs).
