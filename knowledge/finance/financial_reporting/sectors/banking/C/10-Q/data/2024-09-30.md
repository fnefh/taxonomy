## OVERVIEW

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (referred to herein as Citi's 2023 Form 10-K), Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q) and Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q).

Throughout this report, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All "Note" references correspond to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, unless otherwise indicated.

For a list of certain terms and acronyms used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other Citigroup presentations, see "Glossary of Terms and Acronyms" at the end of this report.

Additional information about Citigroup is available on Citi's website at www.citigroup.com. Citigroup's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as well as other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge through Citi's website by clicking on "SEC Filings" under the "Investors" tab.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial statements and disclosures to conform to the current period's presentation, including certain reclassifications to align with Citi's transformation and strategy, for all periods presented.

Please see "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Citi believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results for investors, industry analysts and others, including increased transparency and clarity into Citi's results, and improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its businesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP

financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nonGAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.

Citi's non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q include:

- · Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts
- · Expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment and divestiture-related impacts
- · All Other (managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts
- · Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)
- · Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges
- · Services non-interest revenue excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation
- · NonMarkets net interest income

Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts exclude items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi's previously announced exit markets within All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi's Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly reviews financial information for All Other on a managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more information on Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts, see "Executive Summary" and " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.

For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see "Capital Resources-Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity" below.

For more information on Services non-interest revenues excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, see "Executive Summary" and " Services " below.

For more information on Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gains (losses) on loan hedges, see "Executive Summary" and " Banking " below.

For more information on nonMarkets net interest income, see "Market Risk-NonMarkets Net Interest Income" below.

Citigroup is managed pursuant to five operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth. Activities not assigned to the operating segments are included in All Other . For additional information, see the results of operations for each of the operating segments within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.

Updated financial reporting structure - FOR 2Q 2024.jpg

Note: Mexico is included in LATAM within International.

- (1) Within International, Citi is organized into six clusters: United Kingdom; Japan, Asia North and Australia (JANA); Latin America (LATAM); Asia South; Europe; and Middle East and Africa (MEA). Although the chief operating decision maker (CODM) does not manage Citi's reportable operating segments by cluster, Citi provides additional selected financial information (revenue and certain corporate credit metrics) below for the six clusters within International.

## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Third Quarter of 2024-Continued Progress on Strategy Execution and Other Priorities

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the third quarter of 2024:

- · Citi's revenues increased 1% versus the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, which included an approximate $400 million gain from the sale of the Taiwan consumer banking business in the prior-year period, revenues increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, partially offset by a decline in revenues in All Other (managed basis).
- · Citi's expenses decreased 2% versus the prior-year period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the current quarter and the prior-year period and a $56 million FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, expenses decreased 1%. The decrease was primarily driven by savings associated with Citi's organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume-related expenses and continued investments in Citi's transformation and other risk and control initiatives. (See "Expenses" below.)
- · Citi's cost of credit was approximately $2.7 billion versus $1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was largely driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in U.S. Personal Banking ( USPB ) and a higher allowance for credit losses (ACL) build. The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the higher ACL build was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in the corporate portfolio and an increase in transfer risk reserves associated with unremittable corporate dividends.
- · Citi returned $2.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases.
- · Citigroup's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.7% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6% as of September 30, 2023 (see "Capital Resources" below). This compares to Citigroup's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of September 30, 2024 and 12.0% as of September 30, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Effective October 1, 2024, Citigroup's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, reflecting the decrease in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement to 4.1% from 4.3% (see "Capital Resources-Stress Capital Buffer" below).
- · Citi also continued to make progress with the separation of its consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned initial public offering and winddowns of the

Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses.

## Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary

## Citigroup

Citigroup reported net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.51 per share, compared to net income of $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per share in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 9% versus the prior-year period, driven by the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenue and the lower expenses. Citigroup's effective tax rate in the current quarter was approximately 25%, relatively unchanged from the prior-year period. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%.

Citigroup revenues of $20.3 billion increased 1% versus the prior-year period, on a reported basis. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues of $20.3 billion increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, partially offset by a decline in All Other (managed basis). (For additional information on the divestiture-related impacts, see " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.) (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Services revenues were primarily driven by higher non-interest revenues in Securities Services and Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS). Markets revenues were largely driven by strength in Equity Markets, while Banking revenues largely reflected growth in Investment Banking. USPB revenues benefited from loan growth in cards, as well as lower partner payments, and Wealth revenues were primarily driven by higher investment fee revenue.

Citigroup's end-of-period loans were $689 billion, up 3% versus the prioryear period, largely reflecting loan growth in cards in USPB and higher loans in Markets and Services .

Citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, up 3% versus the prior-year period, largely due to an increase in Services , driven by the continued deepening of client relationships and operating deposit growth in both TTS and Securities Services. For additional information about Citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each applicable business's results of operations and "Liquidity Risk-Deposits" below.

## Expenses

Citigroup's operating expenses of $13.3 billion decreased 2% from the prioryear period. Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included divestiture-related impacts of $67 million (compared to $114 million in the prior-year period). Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods and a $56 million FDIC special assessment benefit in the current quarter, expenses decreased 1%, driven by savings associated with Citi's organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume-related expenses and

continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Citi's transformation initiatives will continue to entail significant investments during the remainder of 2024 and beyond. For more information about Citi's transformation, see "Citi's Multiyear Transformation" below. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment benefit are non-GAAP financial measures.)

## Cost of Credit

Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $2.7 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB and a higher ACL build. The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The increase in the net ACL build was due to changes in portfolio composition in the corporate portfolio, an increase in transfer risk reserves associated with unremittable corporate dividends and loan growth in the consumer portfolio.

For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)" below.

Net credit losses of $2.2 billion increased 33% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.1 billion increased 33%, largely reflecting the higher cards net credit losses. Corporate net credit losses increased to $74 million from $58 million. Citi continues to expect elevated consumer net credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2024.

For additional information on Citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "Credit Risk" below.

## Capital

Citigroup's CET1 Capital ratio was 13.7% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6% as of September 30, 2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by the net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) , partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases and an increase in RWA.

In the third quarter of 2024, Citi paid approximately $1.1 billion of common dividends and repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of common shares (see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below). Citi will continue to determine the level of common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given the uncertainty regarding future regulatory capital requirements. For additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see "Capital ResourcesRegulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below and

"Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 5.8%, compared to 6.0% as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure and a decrease in Tier 1 Capital. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, see "Capital Resources" below.

## Services

Services net income of $1.7 billion increased 23% from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Services expenses of $2.6 billion increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls, and product innovation. Cost of credit was $127 million, compared to $95 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter ACL build was primarily due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside of the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

Services revenues of $5.0 billion increased 8%, primarily reflecting continued momentum across Securities

Services and TTS. Non-interest revenue increased 33%, driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as continued strength across underlying fee drivers. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation (approximately $42 million in the current quarter and approximately $273 million in the prior-year period), non-interest revenue increased 11%. Net interest income was largely unchanged, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Services non-interest revenue excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation is a non-GAAP financial measure.)

TTS revenues of $3.6 billion increased 4% from the prior-year period. TTS non-interest revenue increased 41%, primarily driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, an increase in cross-border transaction value of 8%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 7% and an increase in commercial card spend volume of 8%. The increase in noninterest revenue was partially offset by a 5% decline in net interest income, driven by the decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit volumes.

Securities Services revenues of $1.4 billion increased 24%, largely driven by a 23% increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 24% increase in non-interest revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by higher fees due to a 22% increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations.

For additional information about Citi's exposure in Argentina, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risk-Country Risk-Argentina" below. For additional information on the results of operations of Services in the third quarter of 2024, see " Services " below.

## Markets

Markets net income of $1.1 billion increased 2% from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses. Markets expenses of $3.3 billion increased 1%, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million versus $162 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL build was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in spread products.

Markets revenues of $4.8 billion increased 1%, driven by growth in Equity Markets, up 32%, partially offset by a 6% decline in Fixed Income Markets. Equity Markets benefited from growth in prime services and higher volatility in equity derivatives, as well as higher cash equity volumes. The decline in Fixed Income Markets largely reflected a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 10%, reflecting a strong prior-year performance. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 5%, driven by growth in asset-backed financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower commodities revenue on lower gas volatility.

For additional information on the results of operations of Markets in the third quarter of 2024, see " Markets " below.

## Banking

Banking net income was $238 million, compared to net income of $156 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Banking expenses of $1.1 billion decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning actions. Cost of credit was $177 million, versus a benefit of $56 million in the prioryear period, driven by a net ACL build due to changes in portfolio composition.

Banking revenues of $1.6 billion increased 16%, primarily driven by growth in Investment Banking. Investment Banking revenues increased 31%, reflecting strength in Debt Capital Markets (DCM), which benefited from strong issuance activity in the quarter, an increase in Advisory due to strong announced deal volume from earlier this year coming to fruition as those deals close and an increase in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) reflecting stronger follow-on activity, partially offset by less initial public offering (IPO) activity amid market volatility mid quarter. Corporate Lending revenues were largely unchanged, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 5%, largely driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges are nonGAAP financial measures.)

For additional information on the results of operations of Banking in the third quarter of 2024, see " Banking " below.

## U.S. Personal Banking

USPB net income of $522 million decreased 31% from the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. USPB expenses of $2.5 billion decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build. Net credit losses increased 39%, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The ACL build of $45 million was primarily driven by loan growth.

USPB revenues of $5.0 billion increased 3%, driven by an increase in net interest income due to loan growth in cards, and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues of $2.7 billion increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 8%, as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth of 3%. Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion decreased 1%, primarily driven by a slowing growth rate in interest-earning balances and higher reversals of interest from net credit losses. Retail Banking revenues of $599 million decreased 8%, primarily driven by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth .

For additional information on the results of operations of USPB in the third quarter of 2024, see " U.S. Personal Banking " below.

## Wealth

Wealth net income was $283 million, versus $132 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Wealth expenses decreased 4% to $1.6 billion, primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was $33 million, compared to a benefit of $2 million in the prior-year period, largely due to an ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period.

Wealth revenues of $2.0 billion increased 9%, driven by a 15% increase in non-interest revenue, reflecting higher investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, as well as a 6% increase in net interest income due to higher deposit volumes and spreads. Private Bank revenues of $614 million were largely unchanged from the prior-year period. Wealth at Work revenues of $244 million increased 4%, driven by improved deposit spreads and higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage funding costs. Citigold revenues of $1.1 billion increased 17%, driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes.

For additional information on the results of operations of Wealth in the third quarter of 2024, see " Wealth " below.

## All Other (Managed Basis)

All Other (managed basis) net loss was $483 million, compared to a net loss of $101 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses. All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.1 billion decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by a legal reserve. Cost of credit of $289 million increased 45%, largely reflecting a net ACL build driven by Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in the prior-year period.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were $1.7 billion, a decline of 6% from the prior-year period, largely driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) due to the closed exits and wind-downs. Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $86 million, from $397 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have extended.

For additional information on the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) in the third quarter of 2024, see " All Other -DivestitureRelated Impacts (Reconciling Items)" and " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.

## Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties

Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to pose risks to economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, potential policy and other changes resulting from the incoming U.S. administration and Congress, central bank interest rate policies, unemployment levels, economic growth rates, conflicts in the Middle East, economic conditions and tensions involving China and the RussiaUkraine war. These and other factors could negatively impact global economic growth rates, result in disruptions and volatility in financial markets and cause a recession in various regions and countries globally. These and other factors could also adversely affect Citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2024. For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial conditions during the remainder of 2024, see "Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary" above and each respective business's results of operations, "Managing Global Risk," including "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" and "-Argentina," and "Forward-Looking Statements" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## CITI'S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION

As previously disclosed, Citi's transformation, including the remediation of its 2020 consent orders with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the amendment to the 2020 OCC consent order, is a multiyear endeavor that is not linear. Citi is modernizing and simplifying the Company in order to lead in a dynamic, competitive and digital world. Citi's transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure, going beyond remedying regulatory concerns to intentionally transform how the organization operates, and making investments that not only support current needs, but also benefit the Company over the long term. For additional information on Citi's transformation, including focus areas and status, consent order compliance, governance and transformation bonus program, see "Citi's Multiyear Transformation" in Citi's Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q.

Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory challenges and risks. Citi's transformation initiatives will take several years to complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi may continue to experience significant challenges in satisfying the regulators' expectations in both sufficiency and timing. For additional information about regulatory risks related to Citi's transformation initiatives, see "Risk Factors-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The transformation's target outcomes remain focused on changing Citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance data quality, reduce risk and improve Citi's regulatory compliance and its culture, and (ii) enhance Citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders. Examples of Citi's transformation progress through the third quarter of 2024 include:

- · Closed the 2013 consent order with the FRB related to anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act deficiencies
- · Retired approximately 450 legacy applications through third-quarter 2024 year-to-date, and over 1,250 since 2022, as Citi continued to modernize its technology infrastructure
- · Launched a strategic operations capacity planning tool, which is assisting Citi to streamline and replace various systems and forecast resources needed for expected processing volumes
- · Continued implementation of a strategic loan servicing platform, with live transactions on the platform increasing to approximately $25 billion in notional value
- · Reduced data center consumption through migration of workload to a private cloud and streamlined and reduced the time involved in the cloud onboarding process from over seven weeks to two weeks
- · Upgraded 100% of Citi's over 2,300 ATMs in North America, Singapore, Hong Kong and the UAE to next-generation software for better customer security and monitoring

## 3Q24 vs. 3Q23

Net income of $1.7 billion increased 23%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.

Revenues increased 8%, primarily reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services and TTS. The increase in revenues was driven by higher non-interest revenue (up 33%), largely due to a smaller impact of the Argentine peso devaluation. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation (approximately $42 million in the current quarter and approximately $273 million in the prior-year period), non-interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income was largely unchanged, as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. Average deposits increased 4%, driven by growth in both Securities Services and TTS, as Citi continued to increase operating deposits in both businesses.

TTS revenues increased 4%, as a 41% increase in non-interest revenues was partially offset by a 5% decrease in net interest income. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as growth in underlying fee drivers, including cross-border transaction value (up 8%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 7%) and commercial card spend volume (up 8%). The decrease in net interest income was driven by the

decline in interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit volumes. Average deposits increased 2%, driven by growth in both North America and International. For additional information about Citi's exposure in Argentina, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risk-Country RiskArgentina" below.

Securities Services revenues increased 24%, largely driven by a 23% increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and volumes, and a 24% increase in non-interest revenue. Average deposits increased 13%, driven by growth in both North America and International. The growth in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by the increase in volumerelated fees due to a 22% increase in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation.

Provisions were $127 million, compared to $95 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter net ACL build of $113 million, compared to $68 million in the prior-year period, was largely due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and

soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. See "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

For additional information on Services ' corporate credit portfolio, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Corporate Credit" below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to Services ' future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Argentina" and "-Russia" below, and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## 3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD

Net income of $4.6 billion increased 20%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.

Revenues increased 7%, driven by higher revenues in both Securities Services and TTS, reflecting higher non-interest revenue and higher net interest income.

TTS revenues increased 3%, driven by a 21% increase in non-interest revenue, partially offset by a 1% decrease in net interest income, largely driven by the same factors described above. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina, as well as continued growth in underlying fee drivers, including higher cross-border transaction value (up 8%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 6%) and commercial card spend volume (up 6%).

Securities Services revenues increased 17%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 17% growth in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by spread improvement from higher interest rates across currencies and deposit mix. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the same factors described above.

Expenses were up 7%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation, as well as an Argentina-related transaction tax expense and a legal settlement expense in the second quarter of 2024.

Provisions were $164 million, compared to $304 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses decreased to $20 million, compared to $46 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build was $144 million, compared to $258 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current period was primarily driven by an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook.

## MARKETS

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions . Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking -Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.

Markets ' international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.

## 3Q24 vs. 3Q23

Net income was $522 million, compared to $756 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.

Revenues increased 3%, due to higher net interest income (up 2%), driven by loan growth in cards, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 4%). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses.

Cards revenues increased 4%. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth (up 8%), as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 8%, also reflecting the lower card payment rates and higher card spend volume. Branded Cards card spend volume increased 3%, driven by higher FICO band customers.

Retail Services revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by a slowing growth rate in interest-earnings balances and higher reversals of interest from net credit losses. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see "Provisions" below and Note 5). Retail Services average loans increased 2%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates, partially offset by lower card spend volume. Card spend volume decreased 7%, primarily due to continued lower in-store foot traffic.

Retail Banking revenues decreased 8%, primarily driven by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth . Average deposits decreased 23%, largely reflecting the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth ($26 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months).

Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.

Provisions were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net credit losses of $1.9 billion increased 39%, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses of $1.0 billion increased 41%, and Retail Services net credit losses of $0.8 billion increased 38%.

The net ACL build was $45 million, compared to $116 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current quarter primarily reflected loan growth. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

## 3Q24 vs. 3Q23

Net incom e was $283 million, compared to $132 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit.

Revenues increased 9%, driven by higher non-interest revenue (up 15%), reflecting higher investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, as well as an increase in net interest income (up 6%), driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads.

Client balances increased 14%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets (up 24%), reflecting higher market valuations and strong net new assets generation.

Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfers of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB ($26 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months), partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as Wealth continued to optimize capital usage.

Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged, as the higher investment fee revenues and improved deposit spreads were offset by higher mortgage funding costs.

Wealth at Work revenues increased 4%, driven by improved deposit spreads and the higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by higher mortgage funding costs.

Citigold revenues increased 17%, driven by the higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes.

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by the benefits of prior repositioning and restructuring actions.

Provisions were a cost of $33 million, compared to a benefit of $2 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

## 3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD

Net income was $668 million, compared to $398 millio n in the p rior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit.

Revenues increased 3%, largely driven by an increase in non-interest revenue (up 13%), reflecting higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by lower net interest income (down 3%), mainly due to lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs.

Private Bank revenues were largely unchanged. Wealth at Work revenues decreased 5%, driven by higher mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by higher investment fee revenues. Citigold revenues increased 6%, driven by higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes.

Expenses decreased 2%, mainly driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher volumerelated expenses and technology investments focused on risk and controls and platform enhancements.

Provisions were a benefit of $146 million, compared to a benefit of $7 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a higher net ACL release. The higher net ACL release was primarily driven by a change in the ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.

## ALL OTHER-Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)

All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments ( Services , Markets , Banking , USPB and Wealth ), including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the "Reconciling Items" column in the table below) related to (i) Citi's divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) are non-GAAP financial measures (see "Overview-Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis). The Reconciling Items are fully reflected on each respective line item in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income.

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in Korea and Russia. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales process of its consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises' consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## 3Q24 vs. 3Q23

Net loss was $483 million, compared to a net loss of $101 million in the prioryear period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 18%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis).

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 6%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues were largely unchanged, as higher revenues driven mainly by higher loan volumes and higher fee revenues were offset by the depreciation of the Mexican peso. Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 33%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $86 million, compared to $397 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have extended.

Expenses decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by a legal reserve.

Provisions were $289 million, compared to $199 million in the prior-year period, largely reflecting a net ACL build driven by Mexico Consumer, compared to an ACL release in the prior-year period. Net credit losses of $208 million decreased 12%, primarily driven by the impact from the wind-downs.

For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to All Other 's (managed basis) future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" below, and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## 3Q24 YTD vs. 3Q23 YTD

Net loss was $1.4 billion, compared to net income of $159 million in the prioryear period, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and lower income tax benefits, partially offset by lower cost of credit.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 16%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis). Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 5%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues increased 12%, primarily due to higher loan balances in retail banking, cards and SBMM and higher deposits in SBMM.

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 47%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(109) million, compared to $99 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of the retail banking business in the U.K.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $896 million, compared to $1.8 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher funding costs.

Expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by restructuring charges (see Note 9), the net incremental FDIC special assessment and an aggregate of $136 million of civil money penalties imposed by the FRB and OCC in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by the closed exits and wind-downs.

Provisions were $718 million, compared to $844 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a lower net ACL build, partially offset by a 6% increase in net credit losses, primarily due to higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.

## CAPITAL RESOURCES

For additional information about capital resources, including Citi's capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see "Capital Resources" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

During the third quarter of 2024, Citi returned a total of $2.1 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For additional information, see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below.

Citi paid common dividends of $0.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024, and on October 23, 2024, declared common dividends of $0.56 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. Citi plans to maintain a quarterly common dividend of $0.56 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors' approval. In addition, Citi repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of common shares during the third quarter of 2024. Citi will continue to determine the level of common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given the uncertainty regarding future regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see "Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below.

## Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.7% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6% as of June 30, 2024 and 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.2% as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and 12.1% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework.

Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under the Standardized Approach from June 30, 2024, driven primarily by net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by an increase in Standardized Approach RWA, the payment of common and preferred dividends and common share repurchases. The CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches framework remained largely unchanged from June 30, 2024, as net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI were offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends and common share repurchases, as well as an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from year-end 2023, primarily driven by year-to-date net income of $9.8 billion and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases and an increase in RWA.

## Stress Capital Buffer

In August 2024, the FRB confirmed Citi's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement of 4.1%, decreased from 4.3%, for the four-quarter window from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.

Accordingly, effective October 1, 2024, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.1% SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.

For additional information regarding regulatory capital buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Buffers" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

| Supplementary Leverage ratio | 5.85 % | 5.89 % | 5.82 % |

As presented in the table above, Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.8% at September 30, 2024, compared to 5.9% at June 30, 2024 and 5.8% at December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure, net redemption of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, the payment of common and preferred dividends and common share repurchases, partially offset by net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI .

## Capital Resources of Citigroup's Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions

As presented in the table above, Citibank's capital ratios at September 30, 2024 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was "well capitalized" as of September 30, 2024.

Citibank's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.1% at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.0% at June 30, 2024 and 6.9% at December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by net income and unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recognized in AOCI , partially offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure and the payment of common and preferred dividends. The ratio increased from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by year-to-date net income of $10.6 billion, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends and an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.

## Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios

The following tables present the hypothetical sensitivity of Citigroup's and Citibank's capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach RWA and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of September 30, 2024. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the

impact that a change in Citigroup's or Citibank's financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, RWA, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

| | CET1 Capital ratio | CET1 Capital ratio | Tier 1 Capital ratio | Tier 1 Capital ratio | Total Capital ratio | Total Capital ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In basis points | Impact of $100 million change in CET1 Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in RWA | Impact of $100 million change in Tier 1 Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in RWA | Impact of $100 million change in Total Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in RWA |

| Citigroup | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.2 |
| Citibank | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.3 |

## Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries

At September 30, 2024, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC's net capital rule, of $17 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $12 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of $27 billion at September 30, 2024, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi's other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup's other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2024.

## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)

The table below details Citi's eligible external TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) amounts and ratios, and each TLAC and LTD regulatory requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement:

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars, except ratios | External TLAC | LTD |
| Total eligible amount | $ 336 | $ 148 |
| % of Advanced Approaches risk- weighted assets | 25.8 % | 11.4 % |
| Regulatory requirement (1)(2) | 22.5 | 9.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 43 | $ 24 |
| % of Total Leverage Exposure | 11.2 % | 4.9 % |
| Regulatory requirement | 9.5 | 4.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 50 | $ 13 |

As of September 30, 2024, Citi exceeded each of the TLAC and LTD regulatory requirements, resulting in a $13 billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's TLAC-related requirements, see "Capital Resources-Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Basel III Revisions

On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Citi continues to monitor developments related to this rulemaking.

The capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule's dualrequirement structure for RWA, but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of RWA. The capital proposal would also replace the current market risk framework with a new standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology for calculating RWA for market risk. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints.

The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational RWA amounts.

If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal's impact on RWA amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external longterm debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see "GSIB Surcharge" below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would materially increase Citi's required regulatory capital.

For information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## GSIB Surcharge

Separately on July 27, 2023, the FRB proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year's surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands.

## Long-Term Debt Requirements

On August 29, 2023, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50% of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100%. These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.

## Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

## MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi's risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi's Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi's risk appetite. For more information on managing global risk at Citi, see "Managing Global Risk" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi's credit risk management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi's consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see "Credit Risk" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, see Notes 14 and 15.

## Loans

The table below details the average loans, by segment and/or business, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | 3Q24 | 2Q24 | 3Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Services | $ 87 | $ 82 | $ 83 |
| Markets | 119 | 119 | 108 |

| All Other | $ 33 | $ 34 | $ 35 |
| Total Citigroup loans (AVG) | $ 687 | $ 680 | $ 662 |
| Total Citigroup loans (EOP) | $ 689 | $ 688 | $ 666 |

End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, largely reflecting growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking in USPB and Markets , and were relatively unchanged sequentially.

On an average basis, loans increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely due to growth in USPB , Markets and Services.

As of the third quarter of 2024, average loans for:

- · USPB increased 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services.
- · Wealth remained largely unchanged.
- · Services increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong demand in TTS for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans.
- · Markets increased 10% year-over-year, largely driven by asset-backed lending in spread products, as well as margin loans in Equities.
- · Banking decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by regulatory capital optimization efforts.

## Portfolio Mix-Geography and Counterparty

Citi's corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage of this portfolio across North America and the clusters within International, based on Citi's internal management geography:

| | September 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| North America | 57 | 57 % | 56 | |
| International | 43 | 43 | 44 | |
| Total | 100 | 100 % | 100 | |
| International by cluster | (percentages are based on total Citi) | (percentages are based on total Citi) | (percentages are based on total Citi) | (percentages are based on total Citi) |
| United Kingdom | 11 | 12 % | 11 | |
| Japan, Asia North and Australia (JANA) | 7 | 7 | 7 | |

| Asia South | 5 | 5 | 5 | |
| Europe | 11 | 11 | 11 | |
| Middle East and Africa (MEA) | 3 | 3 | 3 | |

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB

and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:

| | Total exposure | Total exposure | Total exposure | Total exposure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | September 30, 2024 | | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| AAA/AA/A | 49 | % | 49 % | 50 % |
| BBB | 33 | | 33 | 33 |
| BB/B | 17 | | 17 | 16 |
| CCC or below | 1 | | 1 | 1 |
| Total | 100 | % | 100 % 100 | % |

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi's interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of September 30, 2024. Citi has applied management judgment to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been observed.

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

See Note 14 for additional information on Citi's corporate credit portfolio.

## Exposure to Commercial Real Estate

As of September 30, 2024, Citi's total credit exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $64 billion (largely unchanged from June 30, 2024), including $6 billion of exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of approximately $54 billion related to corporate clients, included in the real estate category in the table above, and approximately $10 billion related to Wealth clients that is not in the table above as they are not considered corporate exposures.

In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 79% of Citi's total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of September 30, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the total funded CRE exposure (including Wealth ) was approximately 1.62%, and there were $391 million of non-accrual CRE loans.

## Credit Risk Mitigation

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $39.7 billion, $39.7 billion and $35.9 billion, respectively. Citi's expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

## Rating of Hedged Exposure

| | September 30, 2024 | | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAA/AA/A | 44 | % | 44 % | 45 | % |
| BBB | 47 | | 47 | 44 | |
| BB/B | 8 | | 8 | 10 | |

## Consumer Credit Trends

As indicated above, USPB provides credit card products through Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans through Citi's Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as U.S. cards net credit losses represented approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses for the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Branded Cards represented 68% of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail Services represented 32% of U.S. cards EOP loans.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-overquarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

USPB 's Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and co-branded cards.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

## Retail Services

RetailServices.jpg

USPB 's Retail Services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail Services' target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries

that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Retail Services decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi's cards portfolios, see each respective business's results of operations above and Note 14.

| | Retail Banking |
| --- | --- |
| RetailBanking.jpg | |

USPB 's Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see "Loan-toValue (LTV) Ratios" in Note 14.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Retail Banking was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, and increased yearover-year, primarily driven by the growth and seasoning of personal loans. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely unchanged quarter-overquarter, and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.

| | Wealth |
| --- | --- |
| Wealth.jpg | |

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, credit cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold businesses. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and credit cards.

As of September 30, 2024, approximately $44 billion, or 29%, of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily consisted of mortgage loans, margin loans, personal and small business loans and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 72% were rated investment grade. While the 90+ days past due delinquency rates shown in the chart above were calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rates shown were calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.

As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Wealth were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios.

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers. As presented in the chart above, the third quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss rates from post-pandemic lows.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization from postpandemic lows.

## U.S. Cards FICO Distribution

The following tables present the current FICO score distributions for Citi's Branded Cards and Retail Services portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are updated as they become available.

## Branded Cards

| FICO distribution (1) | September 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ≥ 740 | 55 % | 57 % | 57 % |
| 660-739 | 34 | 33 | 33 |
| < 660 | 11 | 10 | 10 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |

## Retail Services

| FICO distribution (1) | September 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ≥ 740 | 34 % | 35 % | 35 % |
| 660-739 | 42 | 42 | 42 |
| < 660 | 24 | 23 | 23 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |

The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios declined from the prior quarter and prior year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated in recent years, impacted by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional information on FICO scores.

## Non-Accrual Loans and Assets

For additional information on Citi's non-accrual loans and assets, see "NonAccrual Loans and Assets" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Non-Accrual Loans

The table below summarizes Citigroup's non-accrual loans (NAL) as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

## LIQUIDITY RISK

For additional information on funding and liquidity at Citi, including objectives and stress testing, see "Liquidity Risk" and "Risk FactorsLiquidity Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Overview

Citi's liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury through the Liquidity Risk Management Policy (Policy), which sets forth the minimum requirements for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting liquidity risk, consistent with Citi's risk appetite in conjunction with local treasurers and with oversight provided by Independent Risk Management and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The Policy establishes the framework for sound management of Citi's liquidity risk, to facilitate transparency and comparability of liquidity risk-taking activities, and supports Citi's maintenance of adequate liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events including those involving the loss or impairment of both unsecured and secured funding sources.

Citi's enterprise-wide liquidity management framework establishes a risk appetite that is expressed as a set of quantitative minimum levels for Citigroup and Citibank, consolidated to maintain liquidity levels above limits for the U.S. Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR) and Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST). Liquidity concentration risk, which is defined as liquidity risk due to funding concentration to a specific counterparty, industry, product type or maturity, among other categories, is an integral part of Citi's liquidity management framework and is managed in accordance with established risk appetite limits. For example, product or industry concentration limits consider specific attributes of a product (e.g., wholesale deposits, secured versus unsecured, etc.).

Similar requirements applicable to country legal entities, material legal entities (as defined in the public section of Citi's 2023 resolution plan) or other legal entities are specified in the Liquidity Risk Management Procedures (Procedures). The Procedures provide for liquidity risk management, risk identification, risk appetite, risk limits and triggers, and monitoring including escalation, stress testing, risk reporting, training and review, oversight and approval of key liquidity risk proposals, and analytical tools applicable to the entities within the Procedures' scope. In addition, the Procedures provide for data governance, roles and responsibilities, and reference to frameworks within Citi's liquidity management.

Liquidity risk in foreign jurisdictions and legal entities is managed as part of Citi's legal entity liquidity management framework (similar to Citigroup and Citibank), in which legal entities, including those in foreign jurisdictions, are subject to regulatory and internal liquidity stress tests on a standalone basis, managed against legal entity limits set in accordance with Citi's risk appetite and governed by local governance forums. Citi also has other local governance forums for managing its balance sheet and liquidity at various organizational levels, including material legal entities.

Citi's Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer co-chair Citigroup's ALCO, which includes Citi's Treasurer and other senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (see "Risk Governance-Board and Executive Management Committees" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations require approval by the ALCO.

Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Changes in HQLA line categories from the prior-year period were primarily driven by the re-allocation of nontransferable HQLA, which did not change total average HQLA, and thus did not impact Citi's LCR ratio.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup's operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup's consolidated LCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup's average HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as of the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in non-U.S. sovereign debt.

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup had approximately $959 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($561 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($252 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi's HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($146 billion).

## Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi's major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi's LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | Sept. 30, 2024 | Jun. 30, 2024 Sept. 30, 2023 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HQLA | $ 551.2 | $ 541.6 | $ 569.3 |
| Net outflows | 469.6 | 464.0 | 485.3 |
| LCR | 117 % | 117 % | 117 % |
| HQLA in excess of net outflows | $ 81.6 | $ 77.6 | $ 84.0 |

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup's average LCR was unchanged from the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as Citi's average HQLA and net outflows increased proportionately.

In addition, considering Citi's total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $959 billion, Citi maintained approximately $489 billion of excess liquidity resources above the stressed average net outflow of approximately $470 billion, presented in the LCR table above.

## Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

The NSFR is required by a rule promulgated by the U.S. banking agencies and measures the availability of a bank's stable funding against the required stable funding in accordance with the calculation as defined by the rule.

In general, a bank's available stable funding includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must be greater than 100%.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Citigroup's consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. (For additional information, see the Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, on Citi's Investor Relations website. The Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure on Citi's Investor Relations website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form any part of, this Form 10-Q).

## Select Balance Sheet Items

This section provides details of select liquidity-related assets and liabilities reported on Citigroup's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

## Cash and Investments

The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and due from banks , Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and Investment securities . Citi's investment securities portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. At September 30, 2024, Citi's EOP cash and Investment securities comprised approximately 33% of total assets:

| In billions of dollars | 3Q24 | 2Q24 | 3Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cash and due from banks | $ 26 | $ 25 | $ 27 |
| Deposits with banks | 266 | 251 | 260 |
| Investment securities | 500 | 511 | 509 |
| Total Citigroup cash and investment securities (AVG) | $ 792 | $ 787 | $ 796 |
| Total Citigroup cash and investment securities (EOP) | $ 794 | $ 754 | $ 763 |

## Deposits

The table below details the average deposits, by segment and/or business, and the total Citigroup end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | 3Q24 | 2Q24 | 3Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Services | $ 825 | $ 804 | $ 797 |
| TTS | 690 | 677 | 677 |
| Securities Services | 135 | 127 | 120 |
| Markets (1) | 19 | 25 | 23 |
| Banking | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| USPB | 85 | 93 | 110 |
| Wealth | 316 | 316 | 305 |
| All Other -Legacy Franchises | 45 | 50 | 56 |
| All Other -Corporate/Other (1) | 20 | 21 | 23 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (AVG) | $ 1,311 | $ 1,310 | $ 1,315 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (EOP) | $ 1,310 | $ 1,278 | $ 1,274 |

Citi's deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies and is subject to Citi's Liquidity Risk Management Policy and Procedures.

End-of-period deposits increased 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Services , reflecting operating deposit growth. End-of-period deposits increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in TTS and Securities Services.

On an average basis, deposits were largely unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In the third quarter of 2024, average deposits for:

- · Services increased 4% year-over-year, as TTS increased 2% and Securities Services increased 13%. The net increase was primarily attributable to growth in Services operating deposits.
- · USPB decreased 23% year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth more than offset underlying deposit growth.
- · Wealth increased 4% year-over-year, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits from USPB , partially offset by the shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform.
- · All Other decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of deposits in Legacy Franchises.

The majority of Citi's $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately $840 billion) and span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi.

Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $401 billion of USPB and Wealth deposits as of the end of the current quarter, which are diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within Wealth , as well as USPB , and across regions and products. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately 66% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 39% of Private Bank ultra-high net worth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. In addition, USPB 's deposits are spread across six key metropolitan areas in the U.S.

## Long-Term Debt

Weighted-Average Maturity (WAM) The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates' (including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

| WAM in years | Sept. 30, 2024 | Jun. 30, 2024 | Sept. 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured debt | 7.5 | 7.6 | 7.4 |
| Non-bank benchmark debt | 7 | 7.2 | 7.1 |
| Customer-related debt | 8.6 | 8.7 | 8.2 |
| TLAC-eligible debt | 8.5 | 8.6 | 8.7 |

The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity where the option is not held by the issuer, the WAM is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

## Long-Term Debt Outstanding

The following table presents Citi's end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:

| In billions of dollars | Sept. 30, 2024 | Jun. 30, 2024 | Sept. 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-bank (1) | | | |
| Benchmark debt: | | | |
| Senior debt | $ 114.0 | $ 107.7 | $ 110.3 |
| Subordinated debt | 27.9 | 27.2 | 24.5 |
| Trust preferred | 1.6 | 1.6 | 1.6 |
| Customer-related debt | 108.8 | 102.3 | 106.4 |
| Local country and other (2) | 10.3 | 8.5 | 8.5 |
| Total non-bank | $ 262.6 | $ 247.3 | $ 251.3 |
| Bank | | | |
| FHLB borrowings | $ 11.5 | $ 11.5 | $ 8.5 |
| Securitizations (3) | 5.4 | 5.6 | 5.2 |
| Citibank benchmark senior debt | 16.9 | 12.8 | 7.6 |
| Local country and other (2) | 2.7 | 3.1 | 3.2 |
| Total bank | $ 36.5 | $ 33.0 | $ 24.5 |
| Total long-term debt | $ 299.1 | $ 280.3 | $ 275.8 |

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.

Citi's total long-term debt outstanding increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher debt across almost all categories. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 7%, largely related to senior benchmark debt at the bank and non-bank entities and customer-related debt issuances at the nonbank entities.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi's overall funding costs. During the third quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of $9.9 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

## Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities

The table below details Citi's long-term debt issuances and maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the periods presented:

## Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings

Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper issuances and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.

## Secured Funding Transactions

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi's bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi's secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions. Secured funding of $278 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased 8% year-over-year and decreased 9% from the prior quarter, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, on an average basis, secured funding was $338 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as "matched book" activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other "matched book" activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.

## Short-Term Borrowings

Citi's short-term borrowings of $41 billion as of September 30, 2024 decreased 4% year-over-year, as issuances of long-term debt replaced the need for short-term borrowings. Sequentially, short-term borrowings increased 7%, compared to June 30, 2024, driven by additional funding to support client activities (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup's and its affiliates' outstanding short-term borrowings).

## Credit Ratings

The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of September 30, 2024. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody's Ratings and A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings as of September 30, 2024.

## Ratings as of September 30, 2024

| | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Long-term | Short-term | Outlook | Long- term | Short- term | Outlook |
| Fitch Ratings (Fitch) | A | F1 | Stable | A+ | F1 | Stable |
| Moody's Ratings (Moody's) | A3 | P-2 | Stable | Aa3 | P-1 | Stable |
| S&P Global Ratings (S&P) | BBB+ | A-2 | Stable | A+ | A-1 | Stable |

## Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades

Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody's or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup's and/or Citibank's funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see "Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks" and "Credit Ratings" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Citigroup Inc. and Citibank-Potential Derivative Triggers

As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024). As detailed under "High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)" above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.

## Citibank-Additional Potential Impacts

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank's senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $11.1 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to $10.8 billion at June 30, 2024) (see Note 21).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

## MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi's trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see "Market Risk-Overview" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS

Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi's net interest income and on Citi's Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital invested in foreign currencies.

## Banking Book Interest Rate Risk

For interest rate risk purposes, Citi's non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi's Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management's Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi's risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup's Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the dayto-day management of Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi's net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi's Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:

- · Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments;
- · Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
- · Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
- · Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi's businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi's funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi's desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives.

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi's Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi's net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi's balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi's modeling and other factors.

Citi utilizes the most recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts.

Citi's IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi's deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. EVS is a net present value (NPV)-based measure of the lifetime cash flows of Citi's Banking Book. It estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book's economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter-term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk limits approved by Citigroup's Board of Directors that are aligned with Citi's risk appetite.

## Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios-Impact on AOCI

Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI , which can in turn impact Citi's common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi's CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi's capital generation capacity.

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:

| In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted | Sept. 30, 2024 | Jun. 30, 2024 | Sept. 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel interest rate shock +100 bps | | | |
| Interest rate exposure (1)(2) | | | |
| U.S. dollar | $ (227) | $ (406) | 82 |
| All other currencies | 1,388 | 1,382 | 1,214 |
| Total | $ 1,161 | $ 976 | 1,296 |
| As a percentage of average interest-earning assets | 0.05 % | 0.04 % | 0.06 % |
| Estimated initial negative impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2) | $ (1,173) | $ (1,084) | (807) |
| Estimated initial impact on CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario (3) | (14) | (14) | (12) |

The All other currencies of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by absolute size: approximately $(0.3) billion from the euro, $0.4 billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. The remaining impact is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.

Citi's balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of September 30, 2024 remained relatively stable year-over-year. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi's IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi's estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.2 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders' equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi's investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately seven months.

## Scenario Analysis

The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income and AOCI under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of September 30, 2024. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the "flooring assumption"). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest rate scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi's Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi's deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because Citi's investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

## Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates-Impacts on AOCI and Capital

As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi's tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.6 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi's CTA in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the euro, Mexican peso and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency

translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi's net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi's RWA denominated in those same currencies. This,

coupled with Citi's foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi's CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi's ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi's TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for additional information on the changes in AOCI .

## NonMarkets Net Interest Income

| In millions of dollars | 3rd Qtr. 2024 | 2nd Qtr. 2024 | 3rd Qtr. 2023 | Change 3Q24 vs. 3Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Non- Markets net interest income-taxable equivalent basis (1) | $ 11,957 $ | 11,455 $ | 12,133 | (1) % |

Citi's net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 was $13.4 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, a decrease of 3% or $0.5 billion from the prior-year period, primarily driven by a 17% decline in Markets net interest income and a 1% decline in nonMarkets net interest income. The decline in Markets net interest income was primarily driven by higher funding costs related to trading inventory in Fixed Income Markets.

The decline in nonMarkets net interest income was largely due to lower revenue from Citi's net investment in Argentina and margin compression on mortgage securities in the investment portfolio that have been extended within Corporate Treasury in All Other . The decline in nonMarkets net interest income was partially offset by loan growth in cards and maturing assets in Citi's securities portfolio being reinvested at higher yields.

Citi's net interest margin was 2.33% on a taxable equivalent basis in the current quarter, a decrease of eight basis points from the prior quarter. The decline in net interest margin was largely driven by a decline in Markets due to dividend seasonality in the prior quarter, partially offset by loan growth in cards and maturing loans and investments being refinanced and reinvested at higher yields.

## MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS

## Value at Risk (VAR)

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and longterm (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of September 30, 2024, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 22% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of June 30, 2024, the add-on was 23%.

As presented in the table below, Citi's average trading VAR for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5% from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to inventory changes in the Markets businesses.

| Average-during quarter | $ 107 |
| High-during quarter | 135 |
| Low-during quarter | 82 |

## Regulatory VAR Back-Testing

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi's VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.

As of September 30, 2024, there was one back-testing exception observed for Citi's Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

## OTHER RISKS

For additional information regarding other risks, including Citi's management of other risks, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Country Risk

## Top 25 Country Exposures

The following table presents Citi's top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2024. (Including the U.S., Citi's top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 98% of Citi's exposure to all countries as of September 30, 2024.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland,

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, in the case of the U.K., only 41% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled counterparties (45% for unfunded commitments), while the majority of the remaining loans are to counterparties domiciled in other European countries. Approximately 91% of the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of September 30, 2024.

Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

## Russia

## Overview

In Russia, Citi's remaining operations are conducted through Services , Markets , Banking and All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

Citi previously ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia and ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in the country, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations, as well as support its employees. In addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other -Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. For additional information, see "Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations" below.

For additional information about Citi's risks related to its Russia exposures, see "Risk Factors-Market-Related Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on Citi's Businesses

## Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures

Citi's remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency.

The following table summarizes Citi's exposures related to its Russia operations:

| In billions of U.S. dollars | September 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | Change 3Q24 vs. 2Q24 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loans | $ - | $ - $ | 0.2 | - |
| Investment securities (1) | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4 | (0.1) |
| Net MTM on derivatives/repos | - | 0.9 | 1.2 | (0.9) |
| Total hedges (on loans and CVA) | - | - | (0.1) | - |
| Unfunded (2) | - | - | - | - |
| Trading accounts assets | - | - | - | - |
| Country risk exposure | $ 0.2 | $ 1.2 $ | 1.7 | (1.0) |
| Cash on deposit and placements (3) | 3.0 | 1.6 | 0.6 | 1.4 |
| Deposit Insurance Agency (4) | 5.8 | 5.3 | 3.5 | 0.5 |
| National Settlements Depository (4) | - | - | - | - |
| Total third-party exposure (5) | $ 9.0 | $ 8.1 $ | 5.8 | 0.9 |
| Additional exposures to Russian counterparties that are not held by the Russian subsidiary | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | - |
| Total Russia exposure (6) | $ 9.1 | $ 8.2 $ | 5.9 | 0.9 |

During the third quarter of 2024, Citi's Russia-related exposures increased by $0.9 billion, to $9.1 billion as presented in the table above. The increase in exposures was primarily driven by inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi's clients, partially offset by depreciation of the Russian ruble. Approximately 82% of Citi's $9.1 billion of total Russiarelated exposures are corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which $5.8 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency.

Citi's net investment in Russia was approximately $0.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 (up from $0.1 billion at June 30, 2024). This increase in the net investment was due to an increase in interest income and custody revenue during the quarter, partially offset by the impact from a net ACL build on other assets, driven by increases in transfer risk for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. For more information on transfer risk reserves, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant EstimatesCiti's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)" below.

Citi hedges its Russian ruble/U.S. dollar spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI . When the Russian ruble depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent value of Citigroup's investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.

## Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi's Businesses

Services , Markets , Banking and All Other -Legacy Franchises results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including the war in Ukraine and its direct and indirect impacts on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi's businesses, see "Executive Summary" and each applicable business's results of operations above.

As of September 30, 2024, Citigroup's ACL included a $0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi's direct Russian counterparties (largely unchanged from June 30, 2024). This balance does not include the additional reserves for transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia.

## Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations

In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $71 million to date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $42 million in estimated charges (approximately $1 million in Banking and $41 million in All Other , excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and "Risk Factors" and "Managing

Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" in Citi's 2023 Form 10K.

## Deconsolidation Risk

Citi's remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (see "Risk Factors-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of September 30, 2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi's foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately $0.2 billion (up from $0.1 billion at June 30, 2024), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.7 billion (unchanged from June 30, 2024) on net intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. The $1.6 billion CTA write-off through earnings under either event is expected to be largely equity neutral, since the reversal of the CTA loss out of AOCI would improve Citi's total AOCI .

## Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients

Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi's role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions' sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payments are otherwise authorized under applicable law.

## Reputational Risks

Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi's response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi's reputation with some or all of these parties.

For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi's inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi's actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi's activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi's reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi's continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Board of Directors' Role in Overseeing Related Risks

The Citigroup Board of Directors (Board) and the Board's Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees receive regular reports from senior management regarding global geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts to Citi (including the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi's operations in Russia and Ukraine). The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the international cluster, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has provided updates to Citi's Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding cybersecurity matters (including Russia-specific risks).

## Ukraine

Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 215 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi's top priority. All of Citi's domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of September 30, 2024, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (unchanged from June 30, 2024).

## Argentina

Citi operates in Argentina through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses. As of September 30, 2024, Citi's net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.3 billion (compared to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2024). Citi uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)-denominated assets directly in earnings. Citi uses Argentina's official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of September 30, 2024, the official ARS exchange rate was 971, which devalued by 6.5% against the USD during the third quarter of 2024.

The decrease in Citi's net investment in Argentina during the quarter was primarily driven by capital repatriations from the onshore net investment, which were authorized by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) on a onetime basis in April 2024 through the purchase of certain USD-denominated bonds (BOPREALs) issued by the BCRA in a primary auction, and subsequent sales of the bonds in the secondary market and remittances of the bond proceeds to the parent entity outside Argentina. During the third quarter, Citi remitted approximately $247 million in dividends from its net investment in Argentina, thereby reducing future FX devaluation risk. In total, $435 million of dividends were remitted in 2024 due to the sale proceeds of the BOPREALs.

In addition to the capital repatriation, Citi's net investment in Argentina was also impacted by earnings from Citi's normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment, partially offset by FX translation losses on the net investment.

Other than the authorized dividend remittance described above, the BCRA continues to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi's ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. The capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina's official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is generally precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi's net monetary assets into USD. If Argentina's official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations.

Of the $1.3 billion net investment in Argentina as of September 30, 2024, Citi's net ARS exposure was approximately $0.9 billion (compared to $0.8 billion as of June 30, 2024). The net ARS exposure was reduced as of the end of the quarter as a result of Citi holding approximately $200 million of USDdenominated loans as well as approximately $200 million of certain local government bonds that are USD denominated. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the third quarter of 2024. Given current economic conditions and the local capital, currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure in the future.

In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of September 30, 2024, Citi hedged approximately $0.3 billion of its ARS exposure through offshore hedges, including NDF derivative instruments. Citi was unable to hedge its remaining ARS exposure, given the illiquidity of the offshore NDF market. To the extent that Citi is unable to execute or renew NDF contracts in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of such derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings.

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-tomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of September 30, 2024. For additional information on Citi's emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see "Risk FactorsStrategic Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

This section contains a summary of Citi's most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup's significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi's results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

## Valuations of Financial Instruments

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities .

Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI .

Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI . Such credit losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.

For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthan-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.

The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi's own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi's fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets . These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi's ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R&S timeframe. The R&S forecast period for all loans is eight quarters.

The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast scenarios-base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.

## Quantitative Component

Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.

For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi's expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.

In addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.

## Qualitative Component

The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:

- · Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
- · Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions
- · Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment

As of the third quarter of 2024, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL increased quarter-over-quarter. The increase was driven by factors such as increases in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law and macroeconomic uncertainties, partially offset by a reduction in qualitative reserves associated with consumer payment behavior related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment.

## Macroeconomic Variables

As further discussed below, Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probabilityweighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.

The tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL for each quarterly reporting period from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024:

| | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. unemployment | 4Q24 | 2Q25 | 4Q25 | 8-quarter average (1) | |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 4.4 % | 4.3 % | 4.3 % | 4.2 | % |
| Citi forecast at 4Q23 | 4.3 | 4.3 | 4.2 | 4.2 | |
| Citi forecast at 1Q24 | 4.1 | 4.1 | 4.0 | 4.0 | |
| Citi forecast at 2Q24 | 4.1 | 4.1 | 4.1 | 4.1 | |
| Citi forecast at 3Q24 | 4.4 | 4.4 | 4.3 | 4.2 | |

| | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. real GDP | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 1.0 % | 2.0 % | 2.4 % |
| Citi forecast at 4Q23 | 1.4 | 1.7 | 2.1 |
| Citi forecast at 1Q24 | 2.3 | 1.8 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 2Q24 | 2.4 | 1.8 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 3Q24 | 2.6 | 1.8 | 2.0 |

Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of the third quarter of 2024, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to slow during 2025, while the unemployment rate increases gradually into the first half of 2025 before gradually declining into 2026.

## Scenario Weighting

Citi's ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios-base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.

Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi's downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.6% in the first quarter of 2026. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2025 of 2.2%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2%.

Citi's ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions. To demonstrate this sensitivity, if Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of September 30, 2024 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the macroeconomic scenarios, there would have been a hypothetical incremental increase in the ACL of approximately $5.3 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.

This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of September 30, 2024.

## 3Q24 Changes in the ACL

As further discussed below, Citi's ending ACL balance for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.1 billion, a slight increase from June 30, 2024. The net build of $0.5 billion in the quarter was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets , an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends in Services and loan growth in USPB . Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of September 30, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.

## Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans

Citi's consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in USPB . Citi's total consumer ACLL build was $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, as a result of higher loan balances. This resulted in a September 30, 2024 ACLL balance of $15.8 billion, or 4.05% of total funded consumer loans.

For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased slightly to 8.15% at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.14% at June 30, 2024. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.08% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.09% at June 30, 2024.

## Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans

Citi had a corporate ACLL build of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, largely driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets. This resulted in a September 30, 2024 ACLL balance of $2.6 billion, or 0.89% of total funded corporate loans.

## ACLUC

Citi had an ACLUC build of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, largely driven by changes in portfolio composition in Banking and Markets . The ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities , was $1.7 billion at September 30, 2024.

## ACL on Other Financial Assets

Citi had an ACL build of $0.2 billion on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. Including FX/Other, the ACL reserve balance of $2.0 billion remained unchanged from June 30, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.

## Regulatory Capital Impact

Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies' final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.

See Notes 1 and 15 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.

## Goodwill

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi's stock price.

The impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the fair values of Citi's reporting units exceeding their carrying values for all reporting units. Additionally, the tests results showed that the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 106%, with the carrying value including approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.

While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi's management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 16 for a further discussion of goodwill.

## Litigation Accruals

## INCOME TAXES

## Effective Tax Rate

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars, except effective tax rate | | | | | | | |
| | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 | 2023 | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Income from continuing operations before income tax expense | $ 4,390 | | $ 4,788 | | $ 13,244 | | $ 15,013 |
| Provision for income taxes | 1,116 | | 1,203 | | 3,299 | | 3,824 |
| Effective tax rate | 25 | % | 25 | % | 25 | % | 25 % |

Citi's effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter of 2024 and in the third quarter of 2023, with the rates for all periods including the impact of divestitures.

## Deferred Tax Assets

For additional information on Citi's deferred tax assets (DTAs), see "Capital Resources," "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Income Taxes" and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The table below summarizes Citi's net DTAs balance:

| Jurisdiction/Component | DTAs balance | DTAs balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| Total U.S. | $ 26.8 | $ 26.3 |
| Total foreign | 3.2 | 3.3 |
| Total | $ 30.0 | $ 29.6 |

At September 30, 2024, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $30.0 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion from June 30, 2024 and an increase of $0.4 billion from December 31, 2023. The decrease quarterover-quarter was primarily from unrealized gains in Other comprehensive income and the year-to-date increase was primarily a result of Citi's geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi's $30.0 billion of net DTAs, $12.8 billion (compared to $13.6 billion at June 30, 2024) was deducted in calculating Citi's regulatory capital, and the remaining $17.2 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.

The $12.8 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.3 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $3.1 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.6 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.

## DTA Realizability

Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of $30.0 billion at September 30, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on management's expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).

## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Citi's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Citi's Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi's disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.

Citi's management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

## DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such activities.

Citi, in its First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q, identified one transaction pursuant to Section 219, and Citi, in its Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q, identified 27 transactions pursuant to Section 219. Citi did not identify any reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 during the third quarter of 2024.

## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this Form 10-Q, including but not limited to statements included within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Citigroup may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.

Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent Citigroup's and its management's beliefs regarding future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target, outlook, guidance and illustrative, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the precautionary statements included within the "Executive Summary," "Citi's Multiyear Transformation" and each business's discussion and analysis of its results of operations above, as well as those included in Citi's Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q, Citi's First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q, Citi's 2023 Form 10-K and Citi's other SEC filings; (ii) the factors listed and described under "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K; and (iii) the risks and uncertainties summarized below:

- · the potential impact to Citi from continued macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatility, including, among others, potential policy and other changes resulting from the incoming U.S. administration and Congress; government fiscal and monetary actions, such as continued interest rate reductions by central banks, changes in interest rate policy, continued reductions in central bank balance sheets, or other monetary policies, including their impacts on Citi's net interest income; increases in unemployment rates; recessions or weak or slowing economic growth in the U.S., Europe and other regions or countries; any resurgence in inflation; geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related to conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war; economic and other geopolitical challenges related to China, including slowing or weak economic growth, challenges in its real estate sector, banking and credit markets and tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan and/or involving China and/or China and the U.S.; significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets, including foreign currency volatility and devaluations and continued strength in the U.S. dollar; and protracted or widespread trade tensions;
- · the potential impact on Citi's ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, due to, among other things, regulatory capital requirements, including annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer (reduced effective October 1, 2024), recalibration of the GSIB surcharge, and supervisory expectations and assessments, including any negative findings regarding absolute capital levels or other aspects of Citi's operations; changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations, such as any changes resulting from the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), changes to the method for calculating the GSIB surcharge and changes to aspects of the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements; Citi's results of operations and financial condition, including the capital impact related to Citi's remaining divestitures; Citi's effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio; Citi's implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; and Citi's DTA utilization;
- · the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes faced by financial institutions, including Citi, in the U.S. and globally, such as potential changes to various aspects of the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to Citi; potential fiscal, monetary, tax, sanctions and other changes from the U.S. federal government, whether due to the incoming administration and Congress or otherwise; potential increased regulatory requirements and costs, such as potential changes in regulatory requirements relating to interest rate risk management; rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the EU, the U.S. and globally relating to climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas that vary and may conflict across jurisdictions, including any new disclosure requirements; and the potential impact these uncertainties and changes could have on Citi's businesses, revenues, overall results of operations, financial condition, business planning and compliance risks and costs;
- · Citi's ability to achieve its objectives, including expense savings and revenue growth, from its transformation, simplification and other strategic and other initiatives, which involve significant complexities, execution challenges and uncertainties, may not be as productive or effective as Citi expects or at all, may result in higher-than-expected expenses, litigation and regulatory scrutiny, CTA and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material, and depend, in part, on factors that Citi cannot control or mitigate, including, among others, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties, customer, client and competitor actions, regulatory requirements or changes and heightened regulatory and supervisory expectations and scrutiny;
- · the potential impact to Citi from climate change due to both physical risks, including acute risks as well as the consequences of chronic changes in climate, and
- transition risks, including those arising from regulatory, market, technological, stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a lowcarbon economy, such as increased regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs, including those associated with the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the SEC's climate disclosures rules (currently stayed), whether due to lack of information and reliable data, interpretive uncertainties or otherwise;
- · Citi's ability to utilize its DTAs and thus reduce the negative impact of the DTAs on Citi's regulatory capital, including as a result of its ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant reversal periods;
- · the potential impact to Citi if its interpretation or application of the complex income-based and non- income-based (such as withholding, stamp, service and other non-income taxes) tax laws to which it is subject in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions differs from those of the relevant governmental taxing authorities, including as a result of litigation or examinations regarding non- income-based tax matters, and the resulting payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, the reduction of certain tax benefits or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded;
- · the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi's co-branding or private label credit card relationships, due to, among other things, increasing competition among card issuers; the general economic environment; changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination of a particular relationship; or other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, whether due to the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise;
- · Citi's ability to address shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance provided by the FRB or FDIC on its resolution plan submissions;
- · the potential impact on Citi's performance and the performance of its individual businesses, including its competitive position and ability to effectively manage its businesses, and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives, if Citi is unable to hire and retain qualified employees, particularly given the highly competitive environment for talent and other factors, such as potential attrition driven by, among other things, changes in worker expectations and regulation of employee compensation in the banking industry;
- · Citi's ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and globally with both financial and non-financial services firms, including as a result of certain competitors being subject to less stringent legal, regulatory and supervisory requirements; the introduction of mobile platforms and new or emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence-driven solutions; potential mergers and acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers; changes in the payments space; reliance on third parties
- for certain product and service offerings and any impact if a third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings; and the increased operational, compliance and other risks resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt existing products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively;
- · the potential impact to Citi from a prior or future failure or disruption of its operational processes or systems, including as a result of, among other things, operational or execution failures, or deficiencies by third parties, including third parties that provide products or services to Citi, other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with Citi; deficiencies in processes or controls; inadequate management of data governance practices, data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decision-making; cyber or information security incidents; human error, such as manual transaction processing errors, which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failure of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure; other similar losses or damage to Citi's property or assets; potential disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi's businesses, as well as the operations of Citi's clients, customers or other third parties; and the increased financial and other costs and reputational, legal and compliance risks resulting from any such failure or disruption of operational processes or systems, including legal and regulatory actions or proceedings, fines and other costs;
- · the increasing risk to Citi's and third parties' computer systems, software and networks from ongoing, continually evolving, sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in, among other things, theft, loss, non-availability, misuse or disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary Citi, client, customer or employee information or assets and a disruption of computer, software or network systems; and the potential impact from such risks, including reputational damage, regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, deposit flight, additional costs (including repair, replacement, remediation and other costs), exposure to litigation and regulatory action and other financial losses;
- · the potential impact of changes or errors in accounting assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of certain accounting principles, related to the preparation of Citi's financial statements, including the estimate of Citi's ACL, which depends on its CECL models and assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and characteristics of Citi's loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets; reserves related to litigation,
- regulatory and tax matters; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and liabilities and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment; the financial impact from reclassification of any CTA component of AOCI into Citi's earnings due to a sale, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event, such as those related to Citi's remaining consumer banking divestitures or other legacy businesses; and the impact of changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations of how Citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations;
- · the potential impact to Citi's results of operations and/or regulatory capital and capital ratios if Citi's risk management and other processes, strategies or models, including, among others, those related to its comprehensive stress testing initiatives or ability to adequately manage, assess and aggregate data, are deficient or ineffective; Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models require refinement, modification or enhancement; or any negative regulatory evaluation or examination finding is issued or enforcement action is taken by Citi's U.S. banking regulators;
- · the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of risk on Citi's results of operations, including due to higher than expected defaults by or a significant downgrade in credit ratings of consumer, corporate or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, such as from indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions, including hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi's inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries impacted by macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges and uncertainties and volatilities;
- · the potential impact on Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity or due to various other factors, including, among others, general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory requirements, including changes in regulations; negative investor or counterparty perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; competition for funding, including a decrease in demand for corporate debt securities; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; changes in Citi's credit spreads; changes in interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;

- · the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the 2020 consent orders with the FRB and OCC and the amendment to the 2020 OCC consent order, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risk and controls, such as enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; Citi's ability to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements to comply with the consent orders, which will continue to require significant investments to meet regulatory expectations; and the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies that may be sought by regulators, such as large civil monetary penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends, changes to directors and/or officers and significant collateral consequences arising from such outcomes; and
- · the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in the emerging markets, including, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar; changes in central bank interest rate and other monetary policies; unemployment, recessions or weak or slowing economic growth; the effects of potential policy and other changes resulting from the incoming U.S. administration and Congress; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; foreign exchange controls, including the inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic, geopolitical and domestic political challenges and uncertainties and volatility; cyberattacks; restrictions arising from retaliatory laws and regulations; sanctions or asset freezes; sovereign debt volatility; fluctuations in commodity prices; election outcomes; regulatory changes, including potential conflicts among regulations with other jurisdictions where Citi does business; limitations on foreign investment; sociopolitical instability; civil unrest; crime, corruption and fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; confiscation of assets; and the need to record CTA and other losses, as well as additional reserves for expected losses for credit exposures based on

the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date that the forward-looking statements were made.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES

______________________________________________________________________

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the accounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included within Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K), Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q) and Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q).

Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.

Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While management uses its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates.

As noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited.

Throughout these Notes, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods' financial statements and notes to conform to the current period's presentation.

Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.

## ACCOUNTING CHANGES

## Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions

In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions.

Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial statements of the Company.

## Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expanded the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as components of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the Company to elect to use the proportional amortization method to account for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized investments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of 2023 accounting changes.

## FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES

## Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) , to improve the disclosures of expenses by requiring public business entities to provide further disaggregation of relevant expense captions (i.e., employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization) in a separate note to the financial statements, a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and the total amount of selling expenses and, in an annual reporting period, an entity's definition of selling expenses.

The ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective or prospective basis and will be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2027 and interim periods for the interim period beginning January 1, 2028. Citi is currently evaluating the impact on its disclosures.

## Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity's crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and changes during the reporting period. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. Citi does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the guidance.

## Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public business entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws; enactment of new tax credits; effect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign

taxes and by jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative threshold.

The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.

## Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended to improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and all segments' profit or loss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis. The amendments also clarified that public entities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment's profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.

Citi plans to adopt the ASU on a retrospective basis for its annual period ending December 31, 2024 and for the interim period beginning January 1, 2025.

## Other Business Exits

## Wind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking Business

On October 25, 2021, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business, which is reported in All Other -Legacy Franchises. In connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) commenced a voluntary early termination program (Korea VERP). Due to the voluntary nature of this termination program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then irrevocably accepted by those employees, at which time related charges are recorded in Compensation and benefit expenses.

The following table summarizes the reserve charges related to the Korea VERP and other initiatives reported in All Other :

| In millions of dollars | Employee termination costs |
| --- | --- |
| Total Citigroup (pretax) | |
| Original charges in fourth quarter 2021 | $ 1,052 |

| Additional charges (releases) | $ (3) |
| Utilization | (670) |
| Foreign exchange | (41) |
| Balance at June 30, 2022 | $ - |

Note: There were no additional charges after June 30, 2022.

The total cash charges for the wind-down were $1.1 billion through 2022, most of which were recognized in 2021. Citi does not expect to record any additional charges in connection with the Korea VERP.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for details on the pension impact of the Korea wind-down.

## Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking Businesses

- · During the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and the first and second quarters of 2024, as part of the previously disclosed cards referral agreement with a Russian bank, approximately $55 million of credit card receivables were settled upon referral and refinanced.

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS

______________________________________________________________________

The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.

Citi is organized into five reportable operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and Wealth , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations. See operating segment details in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

During the third quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain deposit balances from Markets to All Other , to consolidate funding strategies across the Company. This change had no material impact to operating results of Markets or All Other. Prior periods were not reclassified and Citi's consolidated results remained unchanged for all periods presented.

During the second quarter of 2024, Citi realigned businesses engaged in financing and securitization activities within Banking and Markets , transferred the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to All Other and made other immaterial reclassifications to align with Citi's transformation and strategy. These reclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other results, and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi's consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain customer balances between All OtherLegacy Franchises, Services , Markets and Banking in preparation for the IPO of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial reclassifications. These reallocations and reclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other results and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi's consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from All Other based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.

Revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components are treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding charges paid by operating segments and funding credits received by Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in net interest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations within All Other to reconcile the operating segment results to Citi's consolidated results.

The accounting policies of these reportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The following tables present certain information regarding the Company's continuing operations by reportable operating segments and All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-related impacts. Performance measurement is based on Income (loss) from continuing operations . These results are used by the CODM, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

9. RESTRUCTURING

______________________________________________________________________

As previously disclosed, Citi is pursuing various initiatives to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy. As part of its overall simplification initiatives, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi eliminated the previous Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth Management layers, exited certain institutional business lines, and consolidated its regional structure, creating one international group, while centralizing client capabilities and streamlining its global staff functions.

Citi has recorded net restructuring charges of approximately $1.051 billion program-to-date.

Restructuring charges are recorded as a separate line item within Operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. These charges were included within All Other -Corporate/Other.

The following costs associated with these initiatives are included in restructuring charges:

- · Personnel costs: severance costs associated with actual headcount reductions (as well as those that were probable and could be reasonably estimated)
- · Other: costs associated with contract terminations and other direct costs associated with the restructuring, including asset write-downs (non-cash write-downs of capitalized software, which are included in Premises and equipment related to exited businesses)

The following table is a rollforward of the liability related to the restructuring charges:

The Company's policy is to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.

The following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45.

## Evaluating Investments for Impairment-AFS Debt Securities

## Overview

The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company's intent to sell such securities.

For more information on evaluating investments for impairment, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Recognition and Measurement of Impairment

The following table presents total impairment on AFS investments recognized in earnings:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company intends to sell, would more-likely-than-not be required to sell or will be subject to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise | $ 13 | 43 | 36 $ | 137 |

## Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities

The allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was $8 million and $8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

## Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at

## Fair Value

Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to fair value through earnings.

Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at September 30, 2024 and De cember 31, 2023 :

| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Measurement alternative: | | |
| Carrying value | $ 1,762 | $ 1,639 |

Below are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Measurement alternative : (1) | | | | |
| Impairment losses | $ 32 | $ 27 | $ 56 | $ 90 |
| Downward changes for observable prices | 1 | 4 | 2 | 24 |
| Upward changes for observable prices | 25 | 17 | 77 | 49 |

| --- | --- |
| Measurement alternative: | |
| Impairment losses | $ 385 |
| Downward changes for observable prices | 36 |
| Upward changes for observable prices | 1,027 |

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $2 million and $61 million of consumer loans, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $1 million and $1,831 million of consumer loans, respectively. The decline was mainly due to the reclassification of a larger mortgage portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. Except for the acquisition of an approximate $700 million credit card portfolio during the quarter, the Company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Loans held by a business for sale are not included in the above since they have been reclassified to Other assets . See Note 2 for additional information regarding Citigroup's businesses held-for-sale.

## Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)

The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi's U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available. With respect to Citi's consumer loan

portfolio outside of the U.S. as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($76.2 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of customers (see "Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America" below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.

## Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios-U.S. Consumer Mortgages

LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are calculated at

origination and updated by applying market price data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for Citi's U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for substantially all of the portfolio, applied at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

## Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty

Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral and ultimately maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi's significant consumer modification programs are described below.

## Credit Cards

Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers' entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi's standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.

## Residential Mortgages

Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower's formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $8 million and $22 million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $12 million and $22 million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs.

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi's goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

| Total intangible assets | $ 10,791 | $ 6,670 | 4,121 | $ 10,810 | $ 6,389 | 4,421 |

While the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.

## The previous tables do not include:

- · certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;
- · certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company's maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions was $7.3 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively (see Note 14 and Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K);
- · certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm's-length terms;
- · certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 22 for more information on these positions);
- · certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and
- · VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company's funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company's investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, crosscurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include thirdparty assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.

## Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)

The fair value of Citi's capitalized MSRs was $683 million and $729 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $55 billion and $52 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Balance, beginning of period | $ 709 $ | 681 | $ 691 | 665 |
| Originations | 32 | 23 | 68 | 54 |
| Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions | (40) | 42 | (23) | 61 |
| Other changes (1) | (18) | (17) | (53) | (51) |
| Balance, as of September 30 | $ 683 $ | 729 | $ 683 | 729 |

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets .

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Servicing fees | $ 30 | $ 32 | $ 95 | $ 97 |
| Late fees | - | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| Total MSR fees | $ 30 | $ 33 | $ 96 | $ 100 |

In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as Commissions and fees , and changes in MSR fair values are classified as Other revenue .

## Re-securitizations

The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi heldno retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $6.3 billion and $17.0 billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $4.3 billion and $12.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $2.3 billion (including $1.5 billion related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024), compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 (including $930 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately $79.0 billion and $84.1 billion, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.

## Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $20.3 billion and $21.1 billion of purchased assets outstanding, and unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $18.7 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively.

Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At September 30, 2024

and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 63 and 68 days, respectively.

Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancements, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Each credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi's internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit's assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $2.1 billion and $2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $9.2 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company's investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

## Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.

The Company provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $0.6 billion and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

## Asset-Based Financing

The primary types of Citi's asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi's maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

22. DERIVATIVES

______________________________________________________________________

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi's use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10K.

Information pertaining to Citigroup's derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi's exposure to derivative transactions. Citi's derivative exposure arises primarily from

market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi's market share, levels of client activity and other factors.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company's derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.

In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the Company's balance sheet presentation, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 for further information.

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are presented below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains (losses) on the economically hedged items:

## Cumulative Basis Adjustment

Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi's hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.

## Cash Flow Hedges

Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.

For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:

| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |

| Net pretax change in cash flow hedges included within AOCI | $ | (171) | $ | 958 | $ | 772 | | $ 1,670 |

The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of September 30, 2024 is approximately $(0.5) billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 14 years.

The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is presented in Note 19.

## Net Investment Hedges

Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup's equity investments in several nonU.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI .

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $(92) million and $1,158 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $363 million and $(586) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

## Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives

Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $14 billion and $15 billion, respectively. The Company posted $12 billion and $12 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of September 30, 2024, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.2 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $16 million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion.

## Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers

For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

At September 30, 2024, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $5.3 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of September 30, 2024 was $168 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $31 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $4.3 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $121 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $29 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

______________________________________________________________________

For additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

- · Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
- · Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable in the market.
- · Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable .

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible.

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data-driven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:

- · The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based on the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date.
- · A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.
- · Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

## Market Valuation Adjustments

The table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the fair value of derivative instruments (recorded in Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

| | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| Counterparty CVA | $ (531) $ | (580) |
| Asset FVA | (478) | (562) |
| Citigroup (own credit) CVA | 342 | 381 |
| Liability FVA | 213 | 255 |
| Total CVA and FVA-derivative instruments | $ (454) $ | (506) |

The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in CVA and FVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges (recorded in Principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income), and changes in debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi's own fair value option (FVO) liabilities (recorded in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income) for the periods indicated:

| | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) |

| Own credit CVA | (2) | 14 | (48) | (134) |
| Liability FVA | (13) | 38 | (42) | (5) |
| Total CVA and FVA- derivative instruments | $ (52) | 70 | $ (59) | $ (57) |
| DVA related to own FVO liabilities (1) | $ (201) | 395 | $ (608) | $ (875) |
| Total CVA, DVA and FVA | $ (253) | 465 | $ (667) | $ (932) |

## Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company may hedge

positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables:

## Level 3 Fair Value Transfers

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024:

- · During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, transfers of Long-term debt were $0.9 billion and $22.6 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, and $0.6 billion and $3.7 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. The Level 3 to Level 2 YTD transfers were primarily the result of enhanced significance testing of unobservable input for certain structured debt instruments. The Level 2 to Level 3 YTD transfers were primarily the result of certain unobservable inputs becoming more significant to the overall valuation of these instruments.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023:

- · During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, transfers of Long-term debt were $1.0 billion and $4.2 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. Of the $4.2 billion transfer, approximately $3.6 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.6 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $1.3 billion and $7.4 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

## Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

## Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.

The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:

| In millions of dollars | Fair value | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

The following tables present the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup's financial instruments that are not carried at fair value. The tables below therefore exclude items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.

The estimated fair values of the Company's corporate unfunded lending commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $15.2 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

24. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

______________________________________________________________________

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election

may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI .

The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 for additional details on Citi's MSRs.

Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 23.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

| | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Three Months Ended September 30, | Three Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |

| Long-term debt (2) | (6,216) | 2,443 | (8,338) | (4,053) |
| Total liabilities | (6,546) $ | 2,391 | (9,310) $ | (3,936) |

## Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)

Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi's credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19 for additional information.

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company's credit spreads.

The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company's own credit spread (or instrumentspecific credit risk) were a loss of $(201) million and a gain of $395 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a loss of $(608) million and $(875) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company's current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.

## The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

## Certain Loans and Other Credit Products

Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup's lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.

The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:

| | September 30, 2024 | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | Trading assets | Loans | Trading assets | Loans |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 4,059 | 8,106 | 4,518 | $ 7,594 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | 109 | (71) | 88 | 10 |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | 2 | - | 1 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | 1 | - | 1 |

In addition to the amounts reported above, $280 million and $391 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk were a gain of $6 million and a loss of $(27) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.

## Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals

Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi's receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.

## Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)

Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.

The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:

| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 948 $ | 571 |
| Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance | 29 | 17 |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | 1 | 3 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | - |

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrumentspecific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

## Certain Debt Liabilities

The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt or Short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of risk:

| In billions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest rate linked | $ 60.3 $ | 60.4 |
| Foreign exchange linked | 0.2 | - |
| Equity linked | 44.1 | 45.9 |
| Commodity linked | 6.4 | 5.3 |
| Credit linked | 6.3 | 4.7 |
| Total | $ 117.3 $ | 116.3 |

The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions . Changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions .

The following table provides information about long-term debt and short-term borrowings carried at fair value:

| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-term debt | | |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 117,286 | 116,338 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | (2,281) | (2,842) |
| Short-term borrowings | | |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 11,896 | 6,545 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | (330) | (60) |

| Total | $ | 317.4 $ | 94.7 $ | 412.1 | 1,156 |

## Loans Sold with Recourse

In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $12 million and $11 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

## Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing

Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client's derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client's positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi's credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform.

## Carrying Value-Guarantees and Indemnifications

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities .

## Collateral

Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $53.5 billion and $52.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $71.3 billion and $67.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.

## Performance Risk

Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.

| | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars at September 30, 2024 | | Investment grade | Non-investment grade | Not rated | Total |
| Financial standby letters of credit | | $ 67.4 $ | 11.7 | $ - | 79.1 |

| Loans sold with recourse | | - | - | 1.8 | 1.8 |
| Other | | - | 7.7 | - | 7.7 |
| Total | $ | 70.5 $ | 18.5 $ | 1.8 $ | 90.8 |

## Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit

The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.

The table below summarizes Citigroup's credit commitments:

| In millions of dollars | U.S. | Outside of U.S. (1) | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial and similar letters of credit | $ 779 | $ 3,349 | 4,128 $ | 5,345 |
| One- to four-family residential mortgages | 592 | 499 | 1,091 | 1,245 |

## Other Commitments

As a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $4.5 billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.

In the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi had approximately $128.6 billion and $120.9 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $135.3 billion and $96.4 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 11 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company's policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

These amounts are not included in the table above.

## Restricted Cash

Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers' primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority.

Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:

| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cash and due from banks | $ 3,778 | $ 3,479 |
| Deposits with banks, net of allowance | 16,293 | 15,538 |
| Total | $ 20,071 | $ 19,017 |

In addition to the restricted cash amounts presented above, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $5.8 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, was held at the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) and was subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. These restricted amounts are reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

26. LEASES

______________________________________________________________________

The Company's operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of September 30, 2024.

For additional information regarding Citi's leases, see Notes 1 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities , respectively:

| In millions of dollars | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ROU asset | $ 2,822 | 2,801 |
| Lease liability | 2,991 | 2,974 |

The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had a future lease commitment scheduled to commence in April 2025 with fixed lease payments (undiscounted) totaling approximately $255 million over a 15-year lease term.

27. CONTINGENCIES

______________________________________________________________________

The following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosures in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Citigroup's Second Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q, Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Citigroup's First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q and Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.

In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.

If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At September 30, 2024, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate.

As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.

Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup's management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup's accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

28. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES

______________________________________________________________________

Citigroup Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities

to the extent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.'s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 18). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.

RWA: Risk-weighted assets. Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches), which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk for Advanced Approaches. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced Approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk weightings, which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches.

Standardized Approach: Established through Basel III, the Standardized Approach aligns regulatory capital requirements more closely with the key elements of banking risk by introducing a wider differentiation of risk weights and a wider recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques, while avoiding excessive complexity. Accordingly, the Standardized Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual economic risks that banks face.

GAAP measures on a taxable equivalent basis, including the metrics derived from these measures, are non-GAAP financial measures.

TDR: Troubled debt restructuring. Prior to January 1, 2023, a TDR was deemed to occur when the Company modified the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty. Loans
