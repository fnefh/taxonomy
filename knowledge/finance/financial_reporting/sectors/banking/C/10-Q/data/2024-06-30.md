<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (referred to herein as Citi's 2023 Form 10-K) and Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q).</p>
<p>Throughout this report, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All "Note" references correspond to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>For a list of certain terms and acronyms used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other Citigroup presentations, see "Glossary of Terms and Acronyms" at the end of this report.</p>
<p>Additional information about Citigroup is available on Citi's website at www.citigroup.com. Citigroup's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as well as other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge through Citi's website by clicking on "SEC Filings" under the "Investors" tab. The SEC's website also contains these filings and other information regarding Citi at www.sec.gov.</p>
<p>Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial statements and disclosures to conform to the current period's presentation, including certain reclassifications to align with Citi's transformation and strategy, for all periods presented. In connection therewith, during the second quarter of 2024, Citi transferred the retail banking business in the United Kingdom (U.K.), which is being wound down, from Wealth to Legacy Franchises (managed basis) within All Other (managed basis).</p>
<p>Please see "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Citi believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results for investors, industry analysts and others, including increased transparency and clarity into Citi's results, and improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its businesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.</p>
<p>Citi's non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts</li>
<li>· Expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment and divestiture-related impacts</li>
<li>· All Other (managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts</li>
<li>· Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)</li>
<li>· Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges</li>
<li>· NonMarkets net interest income</li>
</ul>
<p>Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts exclude items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi's previously announced exit markets within All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi's Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly reviews financial information for All Other on a managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more information on Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts, see "Executive Summary" and " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.</p>
<p>For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see "Capital Resources-Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity" below.</p>
<p>For more information on Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gains (losses) on loan hedges, see "Executive Summary" and " Banking " below.</p>
<p>For more information on nonMarkets net interest income, see "Market Risk-NonMarkets Net Interest Income" below.</p>
<p>Citigroup is managed pursuant to five operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth. Activities not assigned to the operating segments are included in All Other . For additional information, see the results of operations for each of the operating segments within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Within International, Citi is organized into six clusters: United Kingdom; Japan, Asia North and Australia (JANA); Latin America (LATAM); Asia South; Europe; and Middle East and Africa (MEA). The chief operating decision maker (CODM) does not manage the five core businesses by cluster, but Citi is providing additional selected financial information (revenue and corporate credit metrics) below for the six clusters within International.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Second Quarter of 2024-Results Demonstrated Improved Business Performance and Citi's Continued Focus on Executing Its Strategy As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the second quarter of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Citi's revenues increased 4% versus the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts of $33 million, revenues increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, including an approximate $400 million episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter. A significant portion of this gain was reflected in Markets , with the remainder in All Other (managed basis). The revenue growth across the reportable operating segments was partially offset by a decline in All Other (managed basis).</li>
<li>· Citi's expenses decreased 2% versus the prior-year period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the current quarter and the prior-year period, expenses also decreased 2%. The decrease was driven by savings associated with Citi's organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in Citi's transformation and the accrual for the civil money penalties imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (Civil Money Penalties). (See "Citi's Multiyear Transformation" below.)</li>
<li>· Citi's cost of credit was approximately $2.5 billion versus $1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in U.S. Personal Banking ( USPB ), partially offset by allowance for credit losses (ACL) releases in all businesses except USPB and All Other . The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected the maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.</li>
<li>· Citi returned $1.0 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends.</li>
<li>· Citigroup's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.6% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of June 30, 2023 (see "Capital Resources" below). This compares to Citigroup's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% under the Basel III Standardized Approach. On October 1, 2024, Citigroup's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio is expected to decrease to 12.1% from 12.3%</li>
</ul>
<p>under the Standardized Approach, reflecting the decrease in the indicative Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement to 4.1% from 4.3% (see "Capital Resources-Stress Capital Buffer" below).</p>
<ul>
<li>· As previously disclosed, on July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup in the amount of approximately $61 million, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, in the amount of $75 million (collectively, the 2024 Consent Orders). The OCC and Citibank also entered into an Amendment (the Amendment) to the October 7, 2020 OCC Consent Order. The Amendment requires Citibank to submit a Resource Review Plan to the OCC within 30 days and establishes certain provisions governing payment of intercompany dividends from Citibank ultimately to Citigroup. Copies of the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment were included as exhibits to Citi's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 10, 2024 (the July 10, 2024 Form 8-K). For additional information regarding the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment, see the July 10, 2024 Form 8-K and "Citi's Multiyear Transformation" below.</li>
<li>· In July 2024, Citi completed the sale and migration of its China consumer portfolios, finalizing Citi's previously announced exit of its consumer banking business in China. Citi also continued to make progress with the wind-downs of the Korea consumer banking business and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as the separation of Citi's consumer banking and small business and middlemarket banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned initial public offering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second Quarter of 2024 Results Summary</h2>
<h2>Citigroup</h2>
<p>Citigroup reported net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.52 per share, compared to net income of $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per share in the prior-year period. Net income increased 10% versus the prior-year period, as the higher revenues and the lower expenses more than offset the higher cost of credit. Citigroup's effective tax rate in the current quarter was approximately 24%, compared to 27% in the prior-year period, reflecting the impact of the geographic mix of earnings and the effects of state tax law changes in the current quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%.</p>
<p>Citigroup revenues of $20.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior-year period, on a reported basis. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues of $20.1 billion increased 3%, driven by growth across all reportable operating segments, including the approximate $400 million episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter. The revenue growth across the reportable operating segments was partially offset by a decline in All</p>
<p>Other (managed basis). (For additional information on the divestiture-related impacts, see " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.) (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)</p>
<p>Services revenues were driven by higher revenues in Securities Services as well as the impact of continued underlying momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), partially offset by lower revenue from the net investment in Argentina. Markets revenues were driven by strength in Equity Markets, which included the episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter, while Banking revenues largely reflected growth in Investment Banking. USPB revenues benefited from loan growth in cards, as well as lower partner payments, and Wealth revenues were primarily driven by higher investment fee revenue.</p>
<p>Citigroup's end-of-period loans were $688 billion, up 4% versus the prioryear period, largely reflecting loan growth in cards in USPB and higher loans in Markets and Services .</p>
<p>Citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 3% versus the prior-year period, largely due to a decline in TTS in Services , primarily reflecting quantitative tightening. For additional information about Citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each applicable business's results of operations and "Liquidity Risk-Deposits" below.</p>
<h2>Expenses</h2>
<p>Citigroup's operating expenses of $13.4 billion decreased 2% from the prioryear period. Expenses in the second quarter of 2024 included divestiturerelated impacts of $85 million (compared to $79 million in the prior-year period). Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods and an incremental FDIC special assessment of $34 million, expenses also decreased 2%, driven by savings associated with Citi's organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in the transformation and the $136 million of Civil Money Penalties. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment are non-GAAP financial measures.)</p>
<h2>Cost of Credit</h2>
<p>Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $2.5 billion, compared to a cost of $1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB , partially offset by ACL releases in all businesses except USPB and All Other . The higher cards net credit losses primarily reflected maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.</p>
<p>For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)" below.</p>
<p>Net credit losses of $2.3 billion increased 52% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.2 billion increased 52%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates. Corporate net credit losses increased to $108 million from $75 million.</p>
<p>For additional information on Citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "Credit Risk" below.</p>
<h2>Capital</h2>
<p>Citigroup's CET1 Capital ratio was 13.6% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of June 30, 2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by the net income, a decrease in RWA, interest rate impacts on Citigroup's investment portfolio and impacts from the sales of certain Asia consumer banking (Asia Consumer) businesses, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, and share repurchases, as well as higher disallowed deferred tax assets.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2024, Citi paid $1.0 billion of common dividends (see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below). As previously announced, Citi currently expects to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of common shares during the third quarter of 2024. In future periods, Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below and "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 2024 was 5.9%, compared to 6.0% as of June 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital and an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, see "Capital Resources" below.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Services net income of $1.5 billion increased 21% from the prior-year period, driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Services expenses of $2.7 billion increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, compared to a cost of $223 million in the prioryear period. The current-quarter ACL release was primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.</p>
<p>Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services, as well as the impact of continued underlying momentum in TTS. The increase in revenues was partially offset by lower net interest income from the net investment in Argentina. Net interest income decreased 1%, largely driven by lower revenue from</p>
<p>the net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates. Non-interest revenue increased 11%, on continued strength across underlying fee drivers, as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina.</p>
<p>TTS revenues of $3.4 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior-year period. TTS non-interest revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by continued growth in underlying drivers, including increases in cross-border transaction value, U.S. dollar clearing volumes and commercial card spend volume. The increase in non-interest revenue was offset by a 3% decline in net interest income, driven by lower revenue from the net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates relative to the prior-year period.</p>
<p>Securities Services revenues of $1.2 billion increased 10%, largely driven by a 14% increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads, and a 7% increase in non-interest revenue. The increase in noninterest revenue was primarily driven by fee growth due to higher assets under custody and administration (AUC/AUA) balances, which benefited from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations.</p>
<p>For additional information about Citi's exposure in Argentina, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risk-Country Risk-Argentina" below. For additional information on the results of operations of Services in the second quarter of 2024, see " Services " below.</p>
<h2>Markets</h2>
<p>Markets net income of $1.4 billion increased 29% from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses. Markets expenses of $3.3 billion decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million versus a benefit of $17 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter ACL release was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition combined with an improved macroeconomic outlook, which was partially offset by higher net credit losses.</p>
<p>Markets revenues of $5.1 billion increased 6%, driven by growth in Equity Markets, up 37%, partially offset by a 3% decline in Fixed Income Markets. The decline in Fixed Income Markets was largely driven by rates and currencies, down 11%, on lower volatility and tighter spreads, partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees. Equity Markets benefited from growth across equity derivatives, which included the episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter. Momentum continued in prime balances.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of Markets in the second quarter of 2024, see " Markets " below.</p>
<h2>Banking</h2>
<p>Banking net income was $406 million, compared to net income of $50 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower benefit from cost of credit. Banking expenses of $1.1 billion decreased 10%, primarily driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, versus a benefit of $148 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the current quarter was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook.</p>
<p>Banking revenues of $1.6 billion increased 38%, driven by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending, as well as a gain on loan hedges ($9 million gain versus $66 million loss in the prior-year period). Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, driven by the Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) businesses as well as Advisory, each reflecting an increased wallet and wallet share gains. Corporate Lending revenues increased 20%, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.)</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of Banking in the second quarter of 2024, see " Banking " below.</p>
<h2>U.S. Personal Banking</h2>
<p>USPB net income of $121 million decreased 74% from the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses. USPB expenses of $2.4 billion decreased 2%, reflecting lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 59%, primarily reflecting the maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The ACL build of $382 million reflected cards loan growth.</p>
<p>USPB revenues of $4.9 billion increased 6%, driven by a 5% increase in net interest income due to loan growth in cards, and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 8%, primarily driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9%, as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth. Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by the lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as higher net interest income on higher interest-earning loan balances. Retail Banking revenues of $636 million increased 3%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment</p>
<p>loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth .</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of USPB in the second quarter of 2024, see " U.S. Personal Banking " below.</p>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>Wealth net income was $210 million, versus $84 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit. Wealth expenses decreased 4% to $1.5 billion, primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million, compared to a cost of $53 million in the prior-year period, as an ACL release reflecting an improved macroeconomic outlook was partially offset by higher net credit losses.</p>
<p>Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion increased 2%, driven by a 13% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in net interest income, largely due to higher mortgage funding costs.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of Wealth in the second quarter of 2024, see " Wealth " below.</p>
<h2>All Other (Managed Basis)</h2>
<p>All Other (managed basis) net loss was $402 million, compared to net income of $78 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, higher cost of credit and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower expenses. All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.1 billion decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by the Civil Money Penalties imposed by the FRB and the OCC. Cost of credit of $243 million increased 22%, largely driven by an ACL build for other assets and higher net credit losses in the current quarter, compared to a release for other assets in the prior-year period. The increase in cost of credit was partially offset by the absence of an ACL build for loans in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 22% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the benefit from the Visa B exchange.</p>
<p>Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were $1.7 billion, a decline of 10% from the prior-year period, due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis), reflecting the closed exits and wind-downs, and Legacy Holdings Assets, driven by higher funding costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues across cards, SBMM and retail banking in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).</p>
<p>Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $253 million, compared to $609 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher funding costs, partially offset by the benefit from the Visa B exchange.</p>
<p>For additional information on the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) in the second quarter of 2024, see " All Other -DivestitureRelated Impacts (Reconciling Items)" and " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.</p>
<h2>Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties</h2>
<p>Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to impact economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, central bank interest rates policies, continued elevated inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to the Russia-Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East, and China. These and other factors have negatively impacted global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and could result in a recession in various regions and countries globally. In addition, these and other factors, including upcoming elections in the U.S., could adversely affect Citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2024.</p>
<p>For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during the remainder of 2024, see "Second Quarter of 2024 Results Summary" above and each respective business's results of operations, "Managing Global Risk," including "Managing Global Risk-Other RisksCountry Risk-Russia" and "-Argentina," and "Forward-Looking Statements" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>CITI'S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As previously announced, Citi's transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders with the FRB and OCC, is a multiyear endeavor that is not linear. Citi is modernizing and simplifying the Company in order to lead in a dynamic, competitive and digital world. Citi's transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure, going beyond remedying regulatory concerns to intentionally transform how the organization operates, and making investments that not only support current needs, but also benefit the Company over the long term.</p>
<p>Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory challenges and risks. As discussed in the "Executive Summary" above, on July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citibank (collectively, the 2024 Consent Orders). In addition, the OCC and Citibank entered into an Amendment (the Amendment) to the October 7, 2020 Consent Order. For additional information about the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment, see Citi's July 10, 2024 Form 8-K and "Transformation Focus Areas and Status" and "FRB and OCC Consent Orders Compliance" below.</p>
<p>Citi's transformation initiatives will take several years to complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi may continue to experience significant challenges in satisfying the regulators' expectations in both sufficiency and timing. The regulators may also identify additional risk and control issues that could result in further regulatory actions. For additional information about these regulatory risks, see "Risk Factors-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment, the transformation's target outcomes remain focused on changing Citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance data quality, reduce risk and improve Citi's regulatory compliance and its culture, and (ii) enhance Citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders.</p>
<h2>Transformation Focus Areas and Status</h2>
<p>Over the last several years, Citi has made key investments to modernize the Company's infrastructure, simplify and automate manual processes, enhance data quality and governance, strengthen controls and reduce risk. In 2023, Citi incurred transformation-related expenses of $2.9 billion (compared to $2.8 billion in 2022), including significant investments in technology, additional hiring in data and risk and controls and contracting third-party consultants. Citi's transformation initiatives will continue to entail significant investments during the remainder of 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>Citi completed significant planning and foundational work for the transformation in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, Citi progressed its transformation efforts into implementation mode. Citi's transformation initiatives in the near term (the remainder of 2024 through 2025) will continue to focus on (i) accelerating progress on automating regulatory processes and</p>
<p>in remediating data, particularly related to regulatory reporting, and (ii) further strengthening stress testing and resolution and recovery capabilities.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>Examples of Citi's transformation progress to date include the following:</p>
<h2>Improved Risk Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Built greater efficiency and scale in the risk management of Citi's Global Spread Products business, with 99% of risk computations now occurring on cloud-based infrastructure</li>
<li>· Implemented automated controls representing more than 80% of transaction volumes across the Markets business to avoid manual trade errors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simplification</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Retired almost 300 legacy applications year-to-date, and more than 1,000 since 2022, thereby simplifying its technology infrastructure and enabling greater focus on more strategic platforms</li>
<li>· Consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to one modern platform</li>
<li>· As of the second quarter of 2024, reduced time to book new or amended loans in North America by over 50%</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resiliency</h2>
<ul>
<li>· As of the second quarter of 2024, improved resiliency and reduced downtime by simplifying system restoration to a single click for approximately 30% of critical applications</li>
<li>· Optimizing virtual workloads to reduce data center footprint and lower operational costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding Citi's investments and remediation efforts, as set forth in the FRB's 2024 Consent Order, the FRB found that, based on examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Citigroup had ongoing deficiencies related to its data quality management program and inadequate measures for managing and controlling its data quality risks. In addition, as set forth in the OCC's 2024 Consent Order and the Amendment, the OCC deemed that Citibank had failed to make sufficient and sustainable progress toward achieving compliance with the OCC's 2020 Consent Order.</p>
<h2>Organizational Simplification</h2>
<p>During the first quarter of 2024, Citi completed its organizational simplification announced in September 2023. The result is a simpler management structure that aligns to and facilitates Citi's strategy, while improving accountability and decision making. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi's new operating model included the elimination of the Institutional Clients Group , Personal Banking and Wealth Management and Legacy Franchises operating segments and resulted in the five current reportable operating segmentsServices , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth -and a new financial reporting structure. Activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments are included in All Other , including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. Citi also</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>consolidated its regional structure from four to two regions, consisting of North America and International. Citi's organizational simplification efforts will also assist in advancing the execution of the transformation.</p>
<h2>FRB and OCC Consent Orders Compliance</h2>
<p>On July 10, 2024, the FRB entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citigroup in the amount of approximately $61 million, and the OCC entered into a Civil Money Penalty Consent Order with Citibank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, in the amount of $75 million. The OCC and Citibank also entered into an Amendment to the October 7, 2020 OCC Consent Order. The Amendment requires Citibank to formalize a process to determine whether sufficient resources are being appropriately allocated toward achieving timely and sustainable compliance with the OCC's 2020 Consent Order, including any requirements on which Citibank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress (such process, the Resource Review Plan). Citibank must submit a Resource Review Plan to the OCC within 30 days. While the Resource Review Plan is being finalized, Citibank will need to ensure that the OCC has no objection to payment of intercompany dividends from Citibank ultimately to Citigroup above the amounts necessary for Citigroup debt service, preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations. Copies of the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment were included as exhibits to Citi's July 10, 2024 Form 8-K. For additional information regarding the 2024 Consent Orders and the Amendment, see the July 10, 2024 Form 8-K.</p>
<p>As discussed above, Citi's transformation efforts include effective implementation of the October 7, 2020 FRB and OCC Consent Orders issued to Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. The 2020 Consent Orders require Citigroup and Citibank to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis, detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of (i) enterprise-wide risk management, (ii) compliance risk management, (iii) data quality management and governance, and (iv) internal controls. Citi continues to work constructively with the FRB and OCC and provide additional information regarding its plans and progress to both regulators on an ongoing basis. Citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts. For additional information about the requirements under the 2020 Consent Orders, see Citi's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 9, 2020.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>Citi has built an organization and infrastructure to manage, guide and support its transformation, which spans all businesses and functions to ensure consistency. Additionally, the Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of each Board, to provide oversight of Citi's efforts to improve its risk and control environment and management's remediation efforts under the consent orders.</p>
<p>While every member of Citi's executive management team, or EMT, is involved in the transformation and plays a</p>
<p>key, direct role in its implementation, Citi's CEO has taken a leading role in managing the effort. As part of this effort, Citi's CEO has assembled a team consisting of long-tenured colleagues and new hires from across various disciplines and areas of expertise and experience, along with representatives from each of Citi's businesses and functions, to lead the various transformation programs. Citi is focusing the Company's most senior talent on this effort and has a detailed, integrated approach to execute on the transformation. Citi's Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by Citi's CEO, sets the overall direction for the transformation and communicates progress to the Citigroup Board of Directors, as well as seeks input and feedback from the Board.</p>
<p>In 2023, Citi appointed a new Chief Operating Officer, who reports to the CEO and is responsible for running Citi's overall transformation efforts, as well as leading Citi's efforts to improve operating efficiency and returns along with Citi's enterprise-wide effort to strengthen its risk and controls and data quality, and modernize infrastructure, while simplifying the Company.</p>
<h2>Transformation Bonus Program</h2>
<p>In 2021, the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee (the Compensation Committee) of Citigroup's Board of Directors approved a long-term performance-based bonus program to incentivize effective execution in connection with the transformation and remediation of the consent orders and to drive change in Citi's risk and control environment and culture (the Transformation Bonus Program, or the Program). There are currently 200 senior employees who were deemed critical to the execution of the transformation and are therefore eligible for the Program.</p>
<p>Performance is measured, and the bonus, if any, payable pursuant to the Transformation Bonus Program is paid in three tranches, each representing a separate performance period. Well-defined goals and related metrics are established for each of the three tranches, which may reflect qualitative considerations, including regulatory actions. At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee determines the appropriate level of payout given the accomplishments for the performance period relative to the specific goals and related metrics. The maximum portion of the bonus payable for each tranche is 25% for the first tranche, 25% for the second tranche and 50% for the third tranche.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the first performance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending December 31, 2022 was 94%, reflecting the Compensation Committee's assessment of performance relative to the predetermined targets set for that tranche under the Program. The targets established for the first performance period included Citi's submission to the FRB and OCC of plans to remediate the issues addressed by the 2020 Consent Orders, and objectively measurable targets to assess performance on transformation milestones. The Compensation Committee recognized that management performed above 90% achievement relative to targets on each metric category during</p>
<p>the first performance period, with the exception of one (the percentage of milestones that were at risk for not being completed on time) for which Citi fell three percentage points short of target.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the second performance measurement period under the Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period ending December 31, 2023 was 80%. The criteria for the second performance measurement period were composed of two quantitative metrics: timely execution of the commitments scheduled to be completed, and execution quality, which is the percentage of those commitments deemed complete by Citi's Internal Audit function. The third criterion for the second performance measurement period was a qualitative consideration of Citi's cultural change, measured by its broad-based 2023 Voice of the Employee survey designed to measure cultural alignment with Citi's Leadership Principles.</p>
<p>The Compensation Committee has determined that the metric categories for the third tranche of the Program, covering the calendar year 2024 performance period, will be the same as the metric categories for the second tranche. The Compensation Committee has set specific objective targets with respect to performance metrics within those categories.</p>

<p>(3)</p>
<p>Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.</p>
<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net income of $1.5 billion increased 21%, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher revenues in Securities Services, as well as the impact of continued underlying momentum in TTS. The increase in revenues was partially offset by lower net interest income from the net investment in Argentina.</p>
<p>TTS revenues were largely unchanged, as a 14% increase in non-interest revenue was offset by a 3% decrease in net interest income. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by continued strength in underlying fee drivers, including an increase in cross-border transaction value of 6%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 7% and an increase in commercial card spend volume of 4%. The increase in non-interest revenue was also driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The decrease in net interest income was driven by lower revenues from the net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates relative to the prior-year period. For additional information about Citi's exposure in Argentina, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risk-Country Risk-Argentina" below.</p>
<p>Securities Services revenues increased 10%, largely driven by 14% growth in net interest income, primarily driven</p>
<p>by higher deposit spreads, and 7% growth in non-interest revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily driven by fee growth due to 9% growth in AUC/AUA balances, benefiting from new client onboarding, deepening relationships with existing clients and higher market valuations.</p>
<p>Expenses were up 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and technology.</p>
<p>Provisions were a benefit of $27 million, compared to $223 million in the prior-year period. The current-quarter ACL release was largely due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. See "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on Services ' corporate credit portfolio, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Corporate Credit" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on trends in Services ' deposits and loans, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Loans" and "Managing Global RiskLiquidity Risk-Deposits" below.</p>
<p>For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to Services ' future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Argentina" and "-Russia" below, and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD</h2>
<p>Net income of $3.0 billion increased 18%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities Services, reflecting higher non-interest revenue and higher net interest income.</p>
<p>TTS revenues increased 3%, driven by a 12% increase in non-interest revenue, as net interest income was largely unchanged. The increase in noninterest revenue reflected continued growth in underlying fee drivers, including higher cross-border transaction value (up 7%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 5%) and commercial card spend volume (up 5%).</p>
<p>Securities Services revenues increased 14%, as net interest income grew 15% and non-interest revenue grew 14%. The increase in net interest income was driven by spread improvement from higher interest rates across currencies and deposit mix. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by the same factors described above, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.</p>
<p>Expenses were up 10%, primarily driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, continued investment in technology and other risk and controls and business-led investments.</p>
<p>Provisions were $37 million, compared to $209 million in the prior-year period, driven by the ACL release in the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the improved macroeconomic outlook.</p>

<h2>MARKETS</h2>
<p>Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.</p>
<p>As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions . Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.</p>
<p>The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking -Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.</p>
<p>Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.</p>
<p>Markets ' international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.</p>

<p>NM Not meaningful</p>
<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net income of $1.4 billion increased 29%, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 6%, driven by higher Equity Markets revenues, partially offset by lower Fixed Income Markets revenues.</p>
<p>Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 3%, reflecting a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 11%, largely reflecting lower volatility as well as tighter spreads in currencies. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 20%, driven by spread products, primarily due to continued loan growth in asset-backed lending and higher securitization and underwriting fees. This increase was partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues.</p>
<p>Equity Markets revenues increased 37%, driven by equity derivatives revenues, which included the impact from an episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange completed in the current quarter, as well as due to increased client financing activity. Equity Markets also continued to experience an increase in prime balances.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 1%, largely driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.</p>
<p>Provisions were a benefit of $11 million, compared to a benefit of $17 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL release of $77 million, compared to a release of $19 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the current quarter was primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition combined with an improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on Markets ' corporate credit portfolio, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Corporate Credit" below.</p>

<h2>2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD</h2>
<p>Net income of $2.9 billion decreased 4%, driven by higher expenses, lower revenues and higher cost of credit.</p>
<p>Revenues declined 1%, primarily driven by lower Fixed Income Markets revenues, partially offset by higher Equity Markets revenues.</p>
<p>Fixed Income Markets revenues decreased 7%, reflecting a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 17%, largely reflecting lower volatility and strong prior-year performance. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 25%, largely driven by increased client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending and mortgages. The increase was partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues.</p>
<p>Equity Markets revenues increased 21%, driven by growth in cash trading, due to higher volumes and increased trading activity, as well as higher equity derivative revenues, which included the impact from the episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange. Equity Markets also continued to experience an increase in prime balances.</p>
<p>Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by the absence of a legal reserve release in the prior-year period and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.</p>
<p>Provisions were $188 million, compared to $67 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net credit losses.</p>
<h2>BANKING</h2>
<p>Banking includes Investment Banking, which supports clients' capital-raising needs to help strengthen and grow their businesses, including equity and debt capital markets-related strategic financing solutions, as well as advisory services related to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings and corporate defense activities; and Corporate Lending, which includes corporate and commercial banking, serving as the conduit for Citi's full product suite to clients.</p>
<p>Banking revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024, Banking had $147 billion in assets including $87 billion in loans, and $0.5 billion in deposits.</p>

<p>The discussion of the results of operations for Banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.</p>
<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net income was $406 million, compared to net income of $50 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower benefit from cost of credit.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 38% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues, driven by continued recovery of the global investment banking wallet and wallet share gains, as well as higher revenues in Corporate Lending and gains on loan hedges ($9 million gain versus $66 million loss in the prior-year period). Excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 30%.</p>
<p>Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, driven by the DCM and ECM businesses as well as Advisory, reflecting the increased wallet and wallet share gains. DCM underwriting fees increased 90%, which continued to benefit from strong issuance activity, primarily in investment grade. ECM underwriting fees increased 10%, primarily driven by an increase in IPO activity and continued convertible issuance. Advisory fees increased 72%, driven by higher revenues from the relatively low announced mergers and acquisitions activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close.</p>
<p>Corporate Lending revenues increased 20%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base.</p>
<p>Provisions reflected a benefit of $32 million, compared to a benefit of $148 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses decreased to $40 million, compared to $57 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release was $72 million, compared to a net release of $205 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the current quarter was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on Banking 's corporate credit portfolio, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Corporate Credit" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on trends in Banking 's deposits and loans, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit Risk-Loans" and "Managing Global RiskLiquidity Risk-Deposits" below.</p>
<p>For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to Banking 's future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Argentina" and "-Russia" below, and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD</h2>
<p>Net income was $930 million, compared to net income of $105 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower benefit from cost of credit.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 42% (including losses on loan hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues, driven by the same factors described above, as well as higher revenues in Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges ($95 million loss versus $265 million loss in the prioryear period). Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 32%.</p>
<p>Investment Banking revenues increased 44%, driven by the DCM and ECM businesses, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity. DCM underwriting fees increased 73%, driven by the same factors described above. ECM underwriting fees increased 29%, driven by the same factors described above. Advisory fees increased 15%, driven by the same factors described above.</p>
<p>Corporate Lending revenues increased 40%, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 20%, largely driven by higher revenue share.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base.</p>
<p>Provisions reflected a benefit of $161 million, compared to $271 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased to $106 million, compared to $69 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release was $267 million, compared to $340 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release in the current period was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and changes in portfolio composition.</p>
<h2>U.S. PERSONAL BANKING</h2>
<p>U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) includes Branded Cards and Retail Services, with proprietary credit card portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded card portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines) within Branded Cards, and co-brand and private label relationships within Retail Services (including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy's and Sears). USPB also includes Retail Banking, which provides traditional banking services to retail and small business customers. At June 30, 2024, USPB had 641 retail bank branches concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Miami. USPB had $164 billion in outstanding credit card balances, $86 billion in deposits, $41 billion in mortgages and $5 billion in personal and small business loans.

<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net income was $121 million, compared to $461 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 6%, due to higher net interest income (up 5%), largely driven by loan growth in cards, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 30%). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses.</p>
<p>Cards revenues increased 7%. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%, primarily driven by interest-earning balance growth (up 9%), as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volumes growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 10%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and the lower card payment rates. Branded Cards card spend volume increased 3%, driven by more affluent customers.</p>
<p>Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by higher noninterest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see "Provisions" below and Note 5), as well as higher net interest income on higher interest-earning balances (up 8%). Retail Services average loans increased 4%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates, and card spend volumes decreased 4%, primarily due to continued lower in-store foot traffic.</p>
<p>Retail Banking revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth . Average mortgage loans increased 14%, primarily driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and mortgage originations exceeding prepayments. Average deposits decreased 18%, largely reflecting the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth ($27 billion over the last 12 months).</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.</p>
<p>Provisions were $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 59%, primarily reflecting the maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the continued higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses were up 69% to $1 billion and Retail Services net credit losses of $0.8 billion were up 50%.</p>
<p>The net ACL build was $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 billion in the prioryear period. The net ACL build in the current quarter primarily reflected cards loan growth. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>
<p>For additional information on USPB 's Branded Cards, Retail Services and Retail Banking loan portfolios, see "Managing Global Risk-Credit RiskConsumer Credit" below.</p>
<p>For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to USPB 's future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Risk FactorsStrategic Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD</h2>
<p>Year-to-date, USPB experienced similar trends to those described above. Net income was $468 million, compared to $863 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues and lower expenses.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 8%, driven by the same factors described above. Cards revenues increased 9%. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by the same factors described above.</p>
<p>Retail Services revenues increased 12%, driven by the same factors described above.</p>
<p>Retail Banking revenues increased 2%, driven by the same factors described above.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 1%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and volume-related expenses.</p>
<p>Provisions were $4.5 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 66%, driven by the same factors described above. Branded Cards net credit losses of $2 billion increased 77% and Retail Services net credit losses of $1.6 billion were up 57%.</p>
<p>The net ACL build was $0.7 billion, compared to $0.9 billion in the prioryear period. The net ACL build in the current period primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>

<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net income was $210 million, compared to $84 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit.</p>
<p>Revenues increased 2%, driven by an increase in non-interest revenue (up 13%), primarily reflecting higher investment fee revenues, driven by net new client investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuations, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income (down 4%), largely driven by higher mortgage funding costs.</p>
<p>Average loans were largely unchanged. Average deposits increased 2%, mainly due to the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits from USPB ($27 billion over the last 12 months), partially offset by lower deposits in Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued transfers to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform.</p>
<p>Client balances increased 9%, primarily driven by the higher client investment assets as well as the higher deposits.</p>
<p>Private Bank revenues increased 1%, driven by improved deposit spreads and the higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by the higher mortgage funding costs.</p>
<p>Wealth at Work revenues decreased 13%, driven by lower deposit spreads and the higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by the higher investment fee revenues.</p>
<p>Citigold revenues increased 6%, driven by the higher investment fee revenues.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by benefits from prior repositioning and restructuring actions.</p>
<p>Provisions were a benefit of $9 million, compared to a cost of $53 million in the prior-year period, as an ACL release more than offset higher net credit losses.</p>
<p>The net ACL release was $43 million, compared to a build of $31 million in the prior-year period, reflecting an improvement in macroeconomic outlook. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>

<p>Citigold revenues increased 1%, driven by the higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads.</p>
<p>Expenses were largely unchanged, as technology investments focused on risk and controls and platform enhancements were offset by benefits from repositioning and restructuring actions.</p>
<p>Provisions were a benefit of $179 million, compared to a benefit of $5 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a higher net ACL release. The higher net ACL release was primarily driven by a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.</p>

<h2>ALL OTHER-Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)</h2>
<p>All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments ( Services , Markets , Banking , USPB and Wealth ), including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.</p>
<p>All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the "Reconciling Items" column in the table below) related to (i) Citi's divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) are non-GAAP financial measures (see "Overview-Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above).</p>
<p>The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis).

<p>Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in Korea and Russia. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales process of its consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises' consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<h2>2Q24 vs. 2Q23</h2>
<p>Net loss was $402 million, compared to net income of $78 million in the prioryear period, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower expenses.</p>
<p>All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 22%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis).</p>
<p>Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 10%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).</p>
<p>Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues increased 16%, mainly due to higher loan balances in retail banking, cards and SBMM and higher deposits in SBMM. Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 54%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.</p>
<p>Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(133) million, compared to $38 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to Legacy Holdings Assets (see Note 3). Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $253 million, compared to $609 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher funding costs, partially offset by an episodic benefit from the Visa B exchange.</p>
<p>Expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower expenses from the closed exits and wind-downs, partially offset by the Civil Money Penalties.</p>
<p>Provisions were $243 million, compared to $200 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL build for other assets and higher net credit losses in the current quarter, compared to a release for other assets in the prioryear period. The increase in provisions was partially offset by a modest net ACL release for loans compared to a build in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased 8%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.</p>
<p>For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.</p>
<p>For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to All Other 's (managed basis) future results, see "Executive Summary" above and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" below, and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD</h2>
<p>Net loss was $879 million, compared to net income of $260 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower cost of credit.</p>
<p>All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 16%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis).</p>
<p>Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 5%, mainly due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).</p>
<p>Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues increased 19%, primarily due to higher loan balances in retail banking, cards and SBMM, higher deposits in SBMM and Mexican peso appreciation.</p>
<p>Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 52%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.</p>
<p>Legacy Holdings Assets revenues decreased to $(129) million, compared to $74 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher funding costs related to the transfer of the retail banking business in the U.K.</p>
<p>Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $810 million, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher funding costs.</p>
<p>Expenses increased 5%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment, restructuring charges (see Note 9) and the Civil Money Penalties, partially offset by the closed exits and wind-downs.</p>
<p>Provisions were $429 million, compared to $645 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net ACL release for loans compared to a build in other assets in the prior-year period. The decrease was partially offset by a 17% increase in net credit losses, primarily due to higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.</p>
<h2>CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>For additional information about capital resources, including Citi's capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see "Capital Resources" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2024, Citi returned a total of $1.0 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends. For additional information, see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below.</p>
<p>Citi paid common dividends of $0.53 per share for the second quarter of 2024, and on July 18, 2024, declared common dividends of $0.56 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Citi plans to maintain a quarterly common dividend of $0.56 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors' approval. As previously announced, Citi currently expects to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of common shares during the third quarter of 2024. In future periods, Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see "Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below.</p>
<h2>Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio</h2>
<p>Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.6% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 13.5% as of March 31, 2024 and 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.2% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 12.0% as of March 31, 2024 and 12.1% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework.</p>
<p>Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from March 31, 2024, driven primarily by net income and decreases in Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches RWA, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from year-end 2023, driven primarily by year-to-date net income of $6.6 billion, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and higher disallowed deferred tax assets. The increase in the CET1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach was also driven by a decrease in Standardized Approach RWA.</p>
<h2>Stress Capital Buffer</h2>
<p>In June 2024, the FRB communicated that Citi's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement (which will be finalized by August 2024) is expected to decrease from the current requirement of 4.3% to 4.1%, starting from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.</p>
<p>Accordingly, effective October 1, 2024, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio is expected to decrease to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the indicative 4.1% SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) will remain unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding regulatory capital buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Buffers" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>As presented in the table above, Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.9% at June 30, 2024, compared to 5.8% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to net income and net issuance of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends. The ratio increased from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to year-to-date net income of $6.6 billion, net issuance of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and higher disallowed deferred tax assets.</p>

<p>As presented in the table above, Citibank's capital ratios at June 30, 2024 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was "well capitalized" as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Citibank's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.0% at June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, compared to 6.9% at December 31, 2023. The ratio increased from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to year-to-date net income of $6.9 billion and a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends.</p>
<h2>Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios</h2>
<p>The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup's and Citibank's capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of June 30, 2024. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the</p>
<p>impact that a change in Citigroup's or Citibank's financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments</h2>
<h2>Basel III Revisions</h2>
<p>On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Citi continues to monitor the joint regulators' review of and discussions related to the new regulations following the industry comment period, including recent comments by the Chair of the FRB.</p>
<p>The capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule's dualrequirement structure for risk-weighted assets, but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of RWA. The capital proposal would also replace the current market risk framework with a new standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology for calculating RWA for market risk. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints.</p>
<p>The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational RWA amounts.</p>
<p>If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal's impact on RWA amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external longterm debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see "GSIB Surcharge" below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would materially increase Citi's required regulatory capital.</p>
<p>For information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>GSIB Surcharge</h2>
<p>Separately on July 27, 2023, the FRB proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year's surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Debt Requirements</h2>
<p>On August 29, 2023, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50% of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100%. These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.</p>
<h2>Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity</h2>
<p>Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.</p>

<p>The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB</p>
<p>and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.</p>

<p>Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.</p>
<p>In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi's interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.</p>
<p>Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p>Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of June 30, 2024. Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been observed.</p>
<p>As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.</p>

<h2>Exposure to Commercial Real Estate</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citi's total credit exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $64 billion (largely unchanged from March 31, 2024), including $7 billion of exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of approximately $53 billion related to corporate clients, included in the real estate category in the table above, and approximately $11 billion related to Wealth clients that is not in the table above as they are not considered corporate exposures.</p>
<p>In addition, as of June 30, 2024, approximately 78% of Citi's total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the total funded CRE exposure (including Wealth ) was approximately 1.61%, and there were $339 million of non-accrual CRE loans.</p>

<h2>Credit Risk Mitigation</h2>
<p>As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $39.7 billion, $38.4 billion and $35.9 billion, respectively. Citi's expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:</p>

<p>As of June 30, 2024, approximately 78% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as U.S. cards net credit losses represented approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses for the second quarter of 2024. As of June 30, 2024, Branded Cards represented 68% of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail Services represented 32% of U.S. cards EOP loans.</p>
<p>As presented in the chart above, the second quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, including those with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic.

<p>USPB 's Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see "Loan-toValue (LTV) Ratios" in Note 14.</p>
<p>As presented in the chart above, the second quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Retail Banking was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the growth and seasoning of personal loans.</p>

<p>As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, credit cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold businesses. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and credit cards.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, approximately $44 billion, or 29%, of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 75% were rated investment grade. While the 90+ days past due delinquency rates shown in the chart above were calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rates shown were calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.</p>
<p>As presented in the chart above, the second quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Wealth were broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios.</p>

<p>The FICO distribution of both cards portfolios trended up from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal portfolio quality improvements, and declined from the prior year, primarily reflecting continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated in recent years, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional information on FICO scores.</p>

<h2>Non-Accrual Loans and Assets</h2>
<p>For additional information on Citi's non-accrual loans and assets, see "NonAccrual Loans and Assets" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Non-Accrual Loans</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes Citigroup's non-accrual loans (NAL) as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.</p>

<h2>LIQUIDITY RISK</h2>
<p>For additional information on funding and liquidity at Citi, including objectives and stress testing, see "Liquidity Risk" and "Risk FactorsLiquidity Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Citi's liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury through the Liquidity Risk Management Policy (Policy), which sets forth the minimum requirements for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting liquidity risk, consistent with Citi's risk appetite in conjunction with local treasurers and with oversight provided by Independent Risk Management and the Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The Policy establishes the framework for sound management of Citi's liquidity risk, to facilitate transparency and comparability of liquidity risk-taking activities, and supports Citi's maintenance of adequate liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events including those involving the loss or impairment of both unsecured and secured funding sources.</p>
<p>Citi's enterprise-wide liquidity management framework establishes a risk appetite that is expressed as a set of quantitative minimum levels for Citigroup and Citibank, consolidated to maintain liquidity levels above limits for the U.S. Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR) and Internal Liquidity Stress Tests (ILST). Liquidity concentration risk, which is defined as liquidity risk due to funding concentration to a specific counterparty, industry, product type or maturity, among other categories, is an integral part of Citi's liquidity management framework and is managed in accordance with established risk appetite limits. For example, product concentration limits consider specific attributes of a product (e.g., wholesale deposits, secured versus unsecured, etc.).</p>
<p>Similar requirements applicable to country legal entities, material legal entities (as defined in the public section of Citi's 2023 resolution plan) or other legal entities are specified in the Liquidity Risk Management Procedures (Procedures). The Procedures provide for liquidity risk management, risk identification, risk appetite, risk limits and triggers, and monitoring including escalation, stress testing, risk reporting, training and review, oversight and approval of key liquidity risk proposals, and analytical tools applicable to the entities within the Procedures' scope. In addition, the Procedures provide for data governance, roles and responsibilities, and reference to frameworks within Citi's liquidity management.</p>
<p>Liquidity risk in foreign jurisdictions and legal entities is managed as part of Citi's legal entity liquidity management framework (similar to Citigroup and Citibank), in which legal entities, including those in foreign jurisdictions, are subject to regulatory and internal liquidity stress tests on a standalone basis, managed against legal entity limits set in accordance with Citi's risk appetite and governed by local governance forums. Citi also has other local governance forums for managing its balance sheet and liquidity at various organizational levels, including material legal entities.</p>
<p>Citi's Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer co-chair Citigroup's ALCO, which includes Citi's Treasurer and other senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (see "Risk Governance-Board and Executive Management Committees" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations require approval by the ALCO.</p>

<p>Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Changes in HQLA line categories from prior periods were primarily driven by the re-allocation of nontransferable HQLA, which did not change total average HQLA, and thus did not impact Citi's LCR ratio.</p>
<p>The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup's operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup's consolidated LCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup's average HQLA decreased quarter-over-quarter as of the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citigroup had approximately $899 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($528 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($239 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi's HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($132 billion).</p>
<p>Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi's major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi's LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:</p>

<p>Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citigroup's average LCR was unchanged from the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as Citi's average HQLA and net outflows decreased proportionally during the two periods.</p>
<p>In addition, considering Citi's total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $899 billion, Citi maintained approximately $435 billion of excess liquidity resources above the stressed average net outflow of approximately $464 billion, presented in the LCR table above.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)</h2>
<p>The NSFR is required by a rule promulgated by the U.S. banking agencies and measures the availability of a bank's stable funding against the required stable funding in accordance with the calculation as defined by the rule.</p>
<p>In general, a bank's available stable funding includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must be greater than 100%.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, Citigroup's consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. Refer to Citi's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 on Citi's Investor Relations website for additional information.</p>

<p>Citi's deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies and is subject to Citi's Liquidity Risk Management Policy and Procedures.</p>
<p>End-of-period deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, largely due to a decline in TTS in Services , primarily reflecting quantitative tightening. Endof-period deposits decreased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal outflows and transfer to investments in Wealth as well as non-operating outflows in TTS.</p>
<p>On an average basis, deposits declined 2% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. In the second quarter of 2024, average deposits for:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Services decreased 1% year-over-year, as TTS decreased 2%, partially offset by an increase in Securities Services of 2%. This net decline reflected the impact of quantitative tightening and non-operating deposit outflows.</li>
<li>· USPB decreased 18% year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth more than offset the underlying growth.</li>
<li>· Wealth increased 2% year-over-year, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits from USPB , partially offset by the shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform.</li>
<li>· All Other decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the continued wind-downs of Asia Consumer and the U.K. retail banking business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of Citi's $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately $807 billion) and span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi.</p>
<p>Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $404 billion of USPB and Wealth deposits as of the end of the current quarter, which are diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within Wealth , as well as USPB , and across regions and products. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately 71% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 37% of Private Bank ultra-high net worth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. In addition, USPB 's deposits are spread across six key metropolitan areas in the U.S.</p>

<p>Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.</p>
<p>Citi's total long-term debt outstanding increased 2% year-over-year, largely driven by increased senior benchmark debt, FHLB borrowings by the bank and subordinated debt at the non-bank entities. The increase was partially offset by a decline in customer-related debt and senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding decreased 2%, largely related to customer-related debt redemptions.</p>
<p>As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi's overall funding costs. During the second quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of $16.3 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.</p>

<h2>Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings</h2>
<p>Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper issuances and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.</p>
<h2>Secured Funding Transactions</h2>
<p>Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi's bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi's secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions.</p>
<p>Secured funding of $305 billion as of June 30, 2024 increased 17% yearover-year and 2% sequentially, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended June 30, 2024, on an average basis, secured funding was $336 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as "matched book" activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other "matched book" activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Borrowings</h2>
<p>Citi's short-term borrowings of $39 billion as of June 30, 2024 decreased 4% year-over-year, as issuances of long-term debt replaced the need for short-term borrowings. Sequentially, short-term borrowings increased 21%, compared to March 31, 2024, driven by additional funding to support client activities (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup's and its affiliates' outstanding short-term borrowings).</p>

<h2>Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades</h2>
<p>Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody's or S&amp;P could negatively impact Citigroup's and/or Citibank's funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.</p>
<p>For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see "Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks" and "Credit Ratings" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Citigroup Inc. and Citibank-Potential Derivative Triggers</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (compared to $0.2 billion as of March 31, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion (compared to $0.3 billion as of March 31, 2024). Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.</p>
<p>In total, as of June 30, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion, compared to $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. As detailed under "High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)" above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.</p>
<h2>Citibank-Additional Potential Impacts</h2>
<p>In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank's senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of June 30, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $10.8 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to $11.1 billion at March 31, 2024) (see Note 21).</p>
<p>In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.</p>
<h2>MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Market risk arises from both Citi's trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see "Market Risk-Overview" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS</h2>
<p>Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi's net interest income and on Citi's Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital invested in foreign currencies.</p>
<h2>Banking Book Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>For interest rate risk purposes, Citi's non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi's Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management's Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi's risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup's Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the dayto-day management of Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.</p>
<p>Changes in interest rates impact Citi's net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi's Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments;</li>
<li>· Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;</li>
<li>· Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and</li>
<li>· Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their ongoing activities, Citi's businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi's funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi's desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi's Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi's net interest income.</p>
<p>The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi's balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi's modeling and other factors.</p>
<p>Citi utilizes the most recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts.</p>
<p>Citi's IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi's deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.</p>
<p>In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. EVS is a net present value (NPV)-based measure of the lifetime cash flows of Citi's Banking Book. It estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book's economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter-term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk limits approved by Citigroup's Board of Directors that are aligned with Citi's risk appetite.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios-Impact on AOCI</h2>
<p>Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI , which can in turn impact Citi's common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi's CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.</p>
<p>AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential</p>
<p>changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi's capital generation capacity.</p>
<p>Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:</p>

<p>The All other currencies of $1,382 million as of June 30, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by absolute size: approximately $(0.2) billion from the euro, $0.2 billion each from the British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee and Chinese yuan. The remaining balance is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.</p>
<p>Citi's balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of June 30, 2024 decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-overyear, primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in Citi's balance sheet. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi's IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi's estimated IRE.</p>
<p>In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.1 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders' equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi's investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months.</p>
<h2>Scenario Analysis</h2>
<p>The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income and AOCI under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of June 30, 2024. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the "flooring assumption"). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.</p>

<p>Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.</p>
<p>As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi's Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi's deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because Citi's investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.</p>
<h2>Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates-Impacts on AOCI and Capital</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi's tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi's CTA in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.</p>
<p>This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency</p>
<p>translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi's net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value</p>
<p>of Citi's RWA denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi's foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi's CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.</p>
<p>The effect of Citi's ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi's TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for additional information on the changes in AOCI .</p>

<p>Citi's net interest income in the second quarter of 2024 was $13.5 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, a decrease of 3% or $0.4 billion from the prior-year period, primarily driven by a 4% decline in nonMarkets net interest income. The decline in nonMarkets net interest income largely reflected lower revenue from Citi's net investment in Argentina, higher mortgage funding costs in Wealth and higher funding costs in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in Corporate Treasury within All Other , partially offset by loan growth in cards. Markets net interest income increased 2%, primarily driven by Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by Equity Markets.</p>
<p>Citi's net interest margin was 2.41% on a taxable equivalent basis in the current quarter, a decrease of one basis point from the prior quarter, largely driven by the lower revenue from Citi's net investment in Argentina and seasonally lower revolving balances in cards, largely offset by the benefits of dividend seasonality in Markets .</p>

<h2>MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS</h2>
<h2>Value at Risk (VAR)</h2>
<p>Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and longterm (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of June 30, 2024, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 23% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of March 31, 2024, the add-on was 30%.</p>
<p>As presented in the table below, Citi's average trading VAR for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 26% from the first quarter of 2024, primarily from inventory changes in the Markets businesses and a reduction in volatility.</p>

<h2>Regulatory VAR Back-Testing</h2>
<p>In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.</p>
<p>Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi's VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, there were two back-testing exceptions observed for Citi's Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.</p>
<h2>OTHER RISKS</h2>
<p>For additional information regarding other risks, including Citi's management of other risks, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Country Risk</h2>
<h2>Top 25 Country Exposures</h2>
<p>The following table presents Citi's top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2024. (Including the U.S., Citi's top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 98% of Citi's exposure to all countries as of June 30, 2024.)</p>
<p>For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries,</p>
<p>most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 40% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (46% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 85% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.</p>

<h2>Russia</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Russia, Citi's remaining operations are conducted through Services , Markets , Banking and All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.</p>
<p>Citi previously ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other -Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank.</p>
<p>Citi ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi continues to manage its existing legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as support its employees. For additional information, see "Citi's WindDown of Its Russia Operations" below.</p>

</table>
<p>During the second quarter of 2024, Citi's Russia-related exposures increased by $1.2 billion, as presented in the table above. The increase in exposures was primarily driven by inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi's clients. Approximately 77% of Citi's $8.2 billion of total Russia exposures are corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which $5.3 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Citi's net investment in Russia was approximately $0.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 (down from $0.2 billion at March 31, 2024).</p>
<p>Citi hedges its Russian ruble/U.S. dollar spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI . When the Russian ruble depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent value of Citigroup's investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.</p>
<h2>Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi's Businesses</h2>
<p>Services , Markets , Banking and All Other -Legacy Franchises results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including the war in Ukraine and its direct and indirect impacts on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi's businesses, see "Executive Summary" and each applicable business's results of operations above.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, Citigroup's ACL included a $0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi's direct Russian counterparties (largely unchanged from December 31, 2023). This balance does not include the additional reserves for transfer risk for exposures in Russia.</p>
<h2>Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations</h2>
<p>In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $67 million to-date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $54 million in estimated charges (approximately $1 million in Banking and $53 million in All Other , excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and "Risk Factors" and "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Deconsolidation Risk</h2>
<p>Citi's remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (see "Risk Factors-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of June 30, 2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.</p>
<p>In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi's foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately $0.1 billion (down from $0.2 billion at March 31, 2024), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from March 31, 2024) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.7 billion (up from $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2024) on net intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve.</p>
<h2>Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients</h2>
<p>Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi's role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions' sanctions laws.</p>
<p>These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payments are otherwise authorized under applicable law.</p>
<h2>Reputational Risks</h2>
<p>Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi's response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi's reputation with some or all of these parties.</p>
<p>For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi's inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi's actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi's activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses.</p>
<p>While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi's reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures.</p>
<p>Citi's continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Board of Directors' Role in Overseeing Related Risks</h2>
<p>The Citigroup Board of Directors (Board) and the Board's Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi's operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as the war's broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts. The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the international cluster, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has also provided updates to Citi's Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding Citi's Russia-related risks, including with respect to cybersecurity matters.</p>
<h2>Ukraine</h2>
<p>Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 220 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi's top priority. All of Citi's domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of June 30, 2024, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (compared to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2024).</p>
<h2>Argentina</h2>
<p>Citi operates in Argentina through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses. As of June 30, 2024, Citi's net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.4 billion (compared to $1.6 billion at March 31, 2024). Citi uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)-denominated assets directly in earnings. Citi uses Argentina's official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of June 30, 2024, the official ARS exchange rate was 911.50, which devalued by 6% against the USD during the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The decrease in Citi's net investment in Argentina during the quarter was primarily driven by capital repatriations from the onshore net investment, which were authorized by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) on a onetime basis in April 2024 through the purchase of certain USD-denominated bonds (BOPREALs) issued by the BCRA in a primary auction, and subsequent sales of the bonds in the secondary market and remittances of the bond proceeds to the parent entity outside Argentina. During the second quarter, Citi remitted a total of approximately $190 million in dividends from its net investment in Argentina, thereby reducing future FX devaluation risk. Citi expects to remit additional dividends during the third quarter following further sales of the BCRA bonds, though the final amount to be remitted is subject to the sales proceeds on the bonds.</p>
<p>In addition to the capital repatriation, Citi's net investment in Argentina was also impacted by earnings from Citi's normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment, which were partially offset by a transaction tax expense and mark-to-market impacts on the BCRA bonds purchased for the dividend remittance, as well as FX translation losses on the net investment.</p>
<p>Other than the authorized dividend remittance described above, the BCRA continues to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi's ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. The capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina's official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is generally precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi's net monetary assets into USD. If Argentina's official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations.</p>
<p>Of the $1.4 billion net investment in Argentina as of June 30, 2024, Citi's net ARS exposure was approximately $0.8 billion. The net ARS exposure was reduced as of the end of the quarter as a result of Citi holding approximately $200 million of USD-denominated loans as well as approximately $400 million of certain local government bonds that are either USD denominated or are indexed to the higher of the USD exchange rate or the local inflation index. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the second quarter of 2024. Given current economic conditions and the local capital, currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of June 30, 2024, Citi was unable to hedge a substantial portion of the remaining ARS exposure, given that the</p>
<p>offshore NDF market remained illiquid. Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute additional NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings.</p>
<p>Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-tomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of June 30, 2024. For additional information on Citi's emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see "Risk FactorsStrategic Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>This section contains a summary of Citi's most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup's significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi's results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.</p>
<h2>Valuations of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities .</p>
<p>Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.</p>
<p>When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.</p>
<p>Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI .</p>
<p>Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI . Such credit losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.</p>
<p>For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthan-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.</p>
<p>The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi's own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi's fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)</h2>
<p>The table below presents Citi's allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and total ACL as of the second quarter of 2024. For information on the drivers of Citi's ACL build in the second quarter of 2024, see below. For additional information on Citi's accounting policy on accounting for credit losses under ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses; Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) , see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets . These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi's ability to estimate expected credit</p>
<p>losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&amp;S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R&amp;S timeframe. The R&amp;S forecast period for all loans is eight quarters.</p>
<p>The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast scenarios-base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.$^{(1)}$</p>
<h2>Quantitative Component</h2>
<p>Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&amp;S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi's expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.</p>
<p>In addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.</p>
<h2>Qualitative Component</h2>
<p>The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law</li>
<li>· Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions</li>
<li>· Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the higher inflationary and interest rate environment</li>
</ul>
<p>As of the second quarter of 2024, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL decreased quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the full release of COVID-19-related uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and losses have increased and these risks are captured in the quantitative component of the ACL, partially offset by a build for risks associated with consumer payment behavior given the higher inflationary and interest rate environment.</p>
<h2>Macroeconomic Variables</h2>
<p>As further discussed below, Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probabilityweighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.</p>
<p>The tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL for each quarterly reporting period from the second quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024:</p>

<p>Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of the second quarter of 2024, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to slow during 2025, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase slightly over the eight-quarter forecast horizon.</p>
<h2>Scenario Weighting</h2>
<p>Citi's ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios-base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi's downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&amp;S period, with a peak difference of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2025 of 1.9%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.3%.</p>
<p>Citi's ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of June 30, 2024 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple</p>
<p>macroeconomic scenarios. Since Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions, applying a 100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $5.0 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.</p>
<p>This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>2Q24 Changes in the ACL</h2>
<p>As further discussed below, Citi's ending ACL balance for the second quarter of 2024 was $21.8 billion, a slight increase from March 31, 2024. The net build of $0.2 billion in the quarter was primarily driven by higher loan balances in U.S. cards in the quarter. These builds were partially offset by releases in Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth , all driven primarily by an improved macroeconomic outlook in addition to changes in portfolio composition driving the release in Markets . Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of June 30, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans</h2>
<p>Citi's consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in USPB . Citi's total consumer ACLL build was $0.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024, as a result of higher cards loan balances, partially offset by a release in Wealth driven by improvements in macroeconomic outlook. This resulted in a June 30, 2024 ACLL balance of $15.7 billion, or 4.08% of total funded consumer loans.</p>
<p>For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans decreased slightly to 8.14% at June 30, 2024, compared to 8.16% at March 31, 2024, primarily related to an increase in loan balances, as well as impacts from an improved macroeconomic outlook. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.09% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.16% at March 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans</h2>
<p>Citi had a corporate ACLL release of $0.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024, largely driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook in Services , Markets and Banking in addition to the release in Markets due to changes in the composition of the portfolio. This resulted in a June 30, 2024 ACLL balance of $2.5 billion, or 0.85% of total funded corporate loans.</p>
<h2>ACLUC</h2>
<p>Citi had an ACLUC release of less than $0.1 billion in the second quarter of 2024, primarily in Banking . The ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities , was $1.6 billion at June 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>ACL on Other Financial Assets</h2>
<p>Citi had an ACL build of $0.1 billion on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the second quarter of 2024. Including FX/Other, the ACL reserve balance increased $0.2 billion to $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Capital Impact</h2>
<p>Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies' final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.</p>
<p>See Notes 1 and 15 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.</p>
<h2>Goodwill</h2>
<p>Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi's stock price.</p>
<p>The impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the fair values of Citi's reporting units exceeding their carrying values for all reporting units. Additionally, the tests results showed that the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 106%, with the carrying value including approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.</p>
<p>While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi's management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 16 for a further discussion of goodwill.</p>

<p>Citi's effective tax rate was 24% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 27% in the second quarter of 2023, both including the impact of divestitures. The approximate change of three percentage points was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings and the effects of state tax law changes.</p>
<h2>Deferred Tax Assets</h2>
<p>For additional information on Citi's deferred tax assets (DTAs), see "Capital Resources," "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Income Taxes" and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>At June 30, 2024, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $30.2 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion from March 31, 2024 and an increase of $1.7 billion from June 30, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was a result of temporary differences and the year-over-year increase was primarily a result of Citi's geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi's $30.2 billion of net DTAs, $13.6 billion (compared to $14.1 billion at March 31, 2024) was deducted in calculating Citi's regulatory capital, and the remaining $16.6 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.</p>
<p>The $13.6 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.7 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $3.7 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.8 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.</p>
<h2>DTA Realizability</h2>
<p>Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of $30.2 billion at June 30, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on management's expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Citi's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Citi's Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi's disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.</p>
<p>Citi's management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT</h2>
<p>Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such activities. Citi, in its First Quarter of 2024 Form 10Q identified one transaction pursuant to Section 219. During the second quarter of 2024, Citi identified 27 transactions pursuant to Section 219. The transactions were identified as the result of a process enhancement to a specific payment method.</p>
<p>Between October 2019 and August 2023, Citibank Europe plc processed 27 payments on behalf of an airline to an airport management company owned by the Iranian government for charges related to flights over Iranian airspace. The airline leases aircraft owned by U.S. and non-U.S. entities. Only charges for overflying Iranian airspace by aircraft owned by U.S. entities are permissible pursuant to 31 C.F.R. 560.522. The value of the payments for aircraft owned by non-U.S. entities was EUR 473,487.00 (approximately USD 498,257.00). Once identified, these charges were disclosed to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Citi earned fees of EUR 108.00 (approximately USD 116.11) related to these charges.</p>

<li>· the potential impact on Citi's ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, due to, among other things, regulatory capital requirements, including finalization of the Stress Capital Buffer, recalibration of the GSIB surcharge, and supervisory expectations and assessments, including any</li>
<li>negative findings regarding absolute capital levels or other aspects of Citi's operations; changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations, such as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), changes to the method for calculating the GSIB surcharge and changes to aspects of the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements; Citi's results of operations and financial condition, including the capital impact related to Citi's remaining divestitures; Citi's effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio; Citi's implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; and Citi's DTA utilization;</li>
<li>· the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes faced by financial institutions, including Citi, in the U.S. and globally, such as potential changes to various aspects of the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to Citi; potential fiscal, monetary, tax, sanctions and other changes, including potential increased regulatory requirements and costs, such as potential changes in regulatory requirements relating to interest rate risk management; rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the EU, the U.S. and globally relating to climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas that vary and may conflict across jurisdictions, including any new disclosure requirements; and the potential impact these uncertainties and changes could have on Citi's businesses, results of operations, financial condition, business planning and compliance risks and costs;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to achieve its objectives, including expense savings and revenue growth, from its transformation, simplification and other strategic and other initiatives, which involve significant complexities, execution challenges and uncertainties, may not be as productive or effective as Citi expects or at all, may result in higher-than-expected expenses, litigation and regulatory scrutiny, CTA and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material, and depend, in part, on factors that Citi cannot control, including, among others, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties, customer, client and competitor actions and ongoing regulatory requirements or changes;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi from climate change due to both physical risks, including acute risks as well as the consequences of chronic changes in climate, and transition risks, including those arising from regulatory, market, technological, stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy, such as increased regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs, including those associated with the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the SEC's climate disclosures rules (currently stayed), whether due to lack of information and reliable data, interpretive uncertainties or otherwise;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to utilize its DTAs and thus reduce the negative impact of the DTAs on Citi's regulatory capital, including as a result of its ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant reversal periods;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi if its interpretation or application of the complex income-based and non- income-based (such as withholding, stamp, service and other non-income taxes) tax laws to which it is subject in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions differs from those of the relevant governmental taxing authorities, including as a result of litigation or examinations regarding non- income-based tax matters, and the resulting payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, the reduction of certain tax benefits or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded;</li>
<li>· the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi's co-branding or private label credit card relationships, due to, among other things, increasing competition among card issuers; the general economic environment; changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination of a particular relationship; or other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, whether due to the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to address any shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance provided by the FRB or FDIC on its resolution plan submissions;</li>
<li>· the potential impact on Citi's performance and the performance of its individual businesses, including its competitive position and ability to effectively manage its businesses, and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives, if Citi is unable to hire and retain qualified employees, particularly given the highly competitive environment for talent and other factors, such as potential attrition driven by low unemployment, changes in worker expectations and regulation of employee compensation in the banking industry;</li>
<li>· Citi's ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and globally with both financial and non-financial services firms, including as a result of certain competitors being subject to less stringent legal and regulatory requirements; the introduction of mobile platforms and new or emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence-driven solutions; potential mergers and acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers; changes in the payments space; reliance on third parties for certain product and service offerings and any impact if a third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings; and the increased operational, compliance and other risks resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt existing products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi from a prior or future failure or disruption of its operational processes or systems,</li>
<li>including as a result of, among other things, operational or execution failures, or deficiencies by third parties, including third parties that provide products or services to Citi, other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with Citi; deficiencies in processes or controls; inadequate management of data governance practices, data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decision-making; cyber or information security incidents; human error, such as manual transaction processing errors, which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failure of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure; other similar losses or damage to Citi's property or assets; potential disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi's businesses, as well as the operations of Citi's clients, customers or other third parties; and the increased financial and other costs and reputational, legal and compliance risks resulting from any such failure or disruption of operational processes or systems, including legal and regulatory actions or proceedings, fines and other costs;</li>
<li>· the increasing risk to Citi's and third parties' computer systems, software and networks from ongoing, continually evolving, sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in, among other things, theft, loss, non-availability, misuse or disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary Citi, client, customer or employee information or assets and a disruption of computer, software or network systems; and the potential impact from such risks, including reputational damage, regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, deposit flight, additional costs (including repair, replacement, remediation and other costs), exposure to litigation and other financial losses;</li>
<li>· the potential impact of changes or errors in accounting assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of certain accounting principles, related to the preparation of Citi's financial statements, including the estimate of Citi's ACL, which depends on its CECL models and assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and characteristics of Citi's loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets; reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax matters; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and liabilities and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment; the financial impact from reclassification of any CTA component of AOCI into Citi's earnings due to a sale, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event, such as those related to Citi's remaining consumer banking divestitures or other legacy businesses; and the impact of changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or</li>
</ul>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<ul>
<li>interpretations of how Citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi's results of operations and/or regulatory capital and capital ratios if Citi's risk management and other processes, strategies or models, including, among others, those related to its comprehensive stress testing initiatives or ability to adequately manage, assess and aggregate data, are deficient or ineffective; Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models require refinement, modification or enhancement; or any negative regulatory evaluation or examination finding is issued or enforcement action is taken by Citi's U.S. banking regulators;</li>
<li>· the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of risk on Citi's results of operations, including due to a default by or a significant downgrade in credit ratings of consumer, corporate or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, such as from indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions, including hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi's inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries impacted by macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges and uncertainties and volatilities;</li>
<li>· the potential impact on Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity or due to various other factors, including, among others, general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies and regulatory requirements; negative investor perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; competition for funding, including a decrease in demand for corporate debt securities; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; changes in Citi's credit spreads; high interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;</li>
<li>· the impact of a credit ratings downgrade of Citi or certain of its subsidiaries or issuing entities on Citi's funding and liquidity as well as on the operations of certain of its businesses;</li>
<li>· the potential impact to Citi of significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally and ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes, with respect to, among other things, governance, infrastructure, data, risk management practices and controls, customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering, increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes and various regulatory reporting requirements, including the impact on Citi's compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs, such as increased regulatory oversight, material restrictions, including, among others, imposition of additional capital buffers and limitations on capital distributions, enforcement proceedings, penalties and fines;</li>
<li>· the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations,</li>
<li>consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the FRB's 2020 Consent Order, the OCC's 2020 Consent Order, as amended by the Amendment, and the 2024 Consent Orders, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risk and controls, such as enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; Citi's ability to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements to comply with the consent orders, which will continue to require significant investments to meet regulatory expectations; and the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies that may be sought by regulators, such as large civil monetary penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends, changes to directors and/or officers and significant collateral consequences arising from such outcomes; and</li>
<li>· the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in the emerging markets, including, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; strength in the U.S. dollar; central bank interest rate policies and quantitative tightening; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; foreign exchange controls, including the inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic, geopolitical and domestic political challenges and uncertainties and volatility; cyberattacks; restrictions arising from retaliatory laws and regulations; sanctions or asset freezes; sovereign debt volatility; fluctuations in commodity prices; election outcomes; regulatory changes, including potential conflicts among regulations with other jurisdictions where Citi does business; limitations on foreign investment; sociopolitical instability; civil unrest; crime, corruption and fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; confiscation of assets; and the need to record additional reserves for expected losses for credit exposures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.</li>

<p>The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)</h2>
<h2>1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES</h2>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2024 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include the accounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included within Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K) and Citigroup's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q).</p>
<p>Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.</p>
<p>Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While management uses its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited.</p>
<p>Throughout these Notes, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods' financial statements and notes to conform to the current period's presentation.</p>
<p>Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.</p>
<h2>ACCOUNTING CHANGES</h2>
<h2>Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions</h2>
<p>In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions.</p>
<p>Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial statements of the Company.</p>
<h2>Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expanded the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as components of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the Company to elect to use the proportional amortization method to account for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized investments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company.</p>
<p>See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of 2023 accounting changes.</p>
<h2>FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES</h2>
<h2>Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity's crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and changes during the reporting period. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. Citi does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the guidance.</p>
<h2>Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public business entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws or tax credits; effect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and by jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative threshold.</p>
<p>The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.</p>
<h2>Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended to improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and all segments' profit or loss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis. The amendments also clarified that public entities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment's profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.</p>
<p>The ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective basis and will be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2024 and interim periods for the interim period beginning on January 1, 2025. Citi is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its disclosure of reportable segments and related disclosures.</p>
<h2>2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND</h2>
<h2>OTHER BUSINESS EXITS</h2>

<h2>3. OPERATING SEGMENTS</h2>
<p>The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.</p>
<p>Citi is organized into five reportable operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and Wealth , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations. See operating segment details in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2024, Citi realigned businesses engaged in financing and securitization activities within Banking and Markets , transferred the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to All Other and made other immaterial reclassifications to align with Citi's transformation and strategy. These reclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other results, and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi's consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.</p>
<p>Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain customer balances between All OtherLegacy Franchises, Services , Markets and Banking in preparation for</p>
<p>the IPO of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial reclassifications. These reallocations and reclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other results and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi's consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.</p>
<p>Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from All Other based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.</p>
<p>Revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components are treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding charges paid by operating segments and funding credits received by Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in net interest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations within All Other to reconcile the operating segment results to Citi's consolidated results.</p>
<p>The accounting policies of these reportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The following tables present certain information regarding the Company's continuing operations by reportable operating segments and All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-related impacts. Performance measurement is based on Income (loss) from continuing operations. These results are used by the CODM, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.</p>

<h2>6. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS</h2>
<p>Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income related to trading activities, which is an integral part of the profitability of trading activities (see Note 4 for information about net interest income related to trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in Services , Markets and Banking . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 23.</p>
<p>In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.</p>

<h2>9. RESTRUCTURING</h2>
<p>As previously disclosed, Citi is pursuing various initiatives to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy. As part of its overall simplification initiatives, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi eliminated the previous Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth Management layers, exited certain institutional business lines, and consolidated its regional structure, creating one international group, while centralizing client capabilities and streamlining its global staff functions. Citi recorded approximately $781 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the initial implementation of its organizational simplification initiatives.</p>
<p>Citi incurred additional net restructuring charges of approximately $225 million and approximately $36 million related to the continued implementation of its organizational simplification initiatives during the first quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>Citi has recorded net restructuring charges of approximately $1.042 billion program-to-date.</p>

<p>The Company's policy is to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.</p>
<p>The following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the offsetting right.</p>

<h2>HTM Debt Securities Delinquency and Non-Accrual Details</h2>
<p>Citi did not have any HTM debt securities that were delinquent or on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>There were no purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt securities held by the Company as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Evaluating Investments for Impairment-AFS Debt Securities</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company's intent to sell such securities.</p>
<p>For more information on evaluating investments for impairment, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Recognition and Measurement of Impairment</h2>
<p>The following table presents total impairment on AFS investments recognized in earnings:</p>

<h2>Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities</h2>
<p>The allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was $13 million and $8 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at</h2>
<h2>Fair Value</h2>
<p>Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.</p>
<p>The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.</p>
<p>Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to fair value through earnings.</p>
<p>Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at June 30, 2024 and De cember 31, 2023:</p>

<h2>Corporate Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi's exposure to loss, often providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to the borrower's individual circumstances. The following tables detail corporate loan modifications granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications. Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan classified as substandard or worse at the time of modification.</p>

<p>During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale less than $1 million and $59 million of consumer loans, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $2 million and $1,830 million of consumer loans, respectively. The decline was mainly due to the reclassification of a larger mortgage portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 or 2023. Loans held by a business for sale are not included in the above since they have been reclassified to Other assets . See Note 2 for additional information regarding Citigroup's businesses held-for-sale.</p>
<h2>Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)</h2>
<p>The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi's U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available. With respect to Citi's consumer loan</p>
<p>portfolio outside of the U.S. as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($74.7 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of customers (see "Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America" below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.</p>

<h2>Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral and ultimately maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi's significant consumer modification programs are described below.</p>
<h2>Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers' entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi's standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.</p>
<h2>Residential Mortgages</h2>
<p>Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower's formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, $11 million and $17 million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, $15 million and $26 million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. Mortgage loans of $1 million and $3 million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and $1 million and $2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Types of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect</h2>
<p>The following tables provide details on permanent consumer loan modifications granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications:</p>

<h2>The previous tables do not include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;</li>
<li>· certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company's maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions was $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively (see Note 14 and Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K);</li>
<li>· certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm's-length terms;</li>
<li>· certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 22 for more information on these positions);</li>
<li>· certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and</li>
<li>· VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company's funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.</p>
<p>The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.</p>
<p>The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company's investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, crosscurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.</p>
<p>The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include thirdparty assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.</p>

<p>The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets .</p>
<p>The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:</p>

<h2>Re-securitizations</h2>
<p>The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi heldno retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.</p>
<p>The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $6.3 billion and $10.7 billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $3.3 billion and $8.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency resecuritization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $1.8 billion (including $942 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024), compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 (including $930 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency resecuritization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately $73.1 billion and $84.1 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.</p>
<h2>Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits</h2>
<p>At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $20.1 billion and $21.1 billion of purchased assets outstanding, and unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $16.3 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At June 30, 2024 and</p>
<p>December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 80 and 68 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi's internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit's assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $9.3 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company's investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.</p>
<h2>Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts</h2>
<p>At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.</p>
<p>The Company provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.</p>

<h2>Asset-Based Financing</h2>
<p>The primary types of Citi's asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi's maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.</p>

<h2>22. DERIVATIVES</h2>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi's use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10K.</p>
<p>Information pertaining to Citigroup's derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi's exposure to derivative transactions. Citi's derivative exposure arises primarily from</p>
<p>market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.</p>
<p>In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi's market share, levels of client activity and other factors.</p>

<p>The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company's derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.</p>
<p>In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the Company's balance sheet presentation, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.</p>

<h2>Cumulative Basis Adjustment</h2>
<p>Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi's hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.</p>

<h2>Cash Flow Hedges</h2>
<p>Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:</p>

<h2>Net Investment Hedges</h2>
<p>Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup's equity investments in several nonU.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI .</p>
<p>The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $1,057 million and $1,250 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and $(272) million and $(948) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.</p>

<h2>Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives</h2>
<p>Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.</p>
<p>The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $15 billion and $15 billion, respectively. The Company posted $13 billion and $12 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of June 30, 2024, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.2 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $14 million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion.</p>
<h2>Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers</h2>
<p>For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $6.1 billion and $4.3 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $5.7 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of June 30, 2024 was $89 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $46 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $4.3 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $121 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $29 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.</p>
<p>The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.</p>

<h2>23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT</h2>
<p>For additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Hierarchy</h2>
<p>ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.</li>
<li>· Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable in the market.</li>
<li>· Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable .</li>
</ul>
<p>As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible.</p>
<p>The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data-driven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>· The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based on the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date.</li>
<li>· A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.</li>
<li>· Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Market Valuation Adjustments</h2>

<h2>Level 3 Fair Value Transfers</h2>
<p>The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>· During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, transfers of Longterm debt were $20.9 billion and $21.7 billion from Level 3 to Level 2, and $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. The Level 3 to Level 2 transfers were primarily the result of enhanced significance testing of unobservable input for certain structured debt instruments. The Level 2 to Level 3 transfers were primarily the result of certain unobservable inputs becoming more significant to the overall valuation of these instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>· During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, transfers of Longterm debt were $2.1 billion and $3.2 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. Of the $3.2 billion transfer, approximately $2.9 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.3 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $1.3 billion and $6.1 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.</p>
<p>Differences between this table and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed.</p>

<h2>Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis</h2>
<p>Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.</p>
<p>The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:</p>

<p>The estimated fair values of the Company's corporate unfunded lending commitments at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $13.0 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.</p>
<h2>24. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS</h2>
<p>The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election</p>
<p>may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI .</p>
<p>The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 for additional details on Citi's MSRs.</p>
<p>Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 23.</p>

<h2>Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)</h2>
<p>Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi's credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19 for additional information.</p>
<p>Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company's credit spreads.</p>
<p>The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company's own credit spread (or instrumentspecific credit risk) were a gain of $343 million and loss of $(837) million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and a loss of $(407) million and $(1,270) million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company's current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.</p>
<h2>The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</h2>
<p>Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under</p>
<p>agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.</p>
<p>Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<h2>Certain Loans and Other Credit Products</h2>
<p>Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup's lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:</p>

<p>In addition to the amounts reported above, $382 million and $391 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk were zero and a loss of $(25) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.</p>
<h2>Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi's receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.</p>
<h2>Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)</h2>
<p>Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.</p>
<p>The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:</p>

<p>The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<h2>Certain Debt Liabilities</h2>
<p>The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt or Short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>

<h2>Loans Sold with Recourse</h2>
<p>In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $12 million and $11 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing</h2>
<p>Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $16.1 billion and $17.8 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Carrying Value-Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities .</p>
<h2>Performance Risk</h2>
<p>Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.</p>

<h2>Collateral</h2>
<p>Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $50.4 billion and $52.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $71.2 billion and $67.7 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.</p>
<h2>Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit</h2>
<p>The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.</p>

<h2>Other Commitments</h2>
<p>As a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $4.5 billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi had approximately $160.3 billion and $120.9 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $150.2 billion and $96.4 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively.

<p>These amounts are not included in the table above.</p>
<h2>Restricted Cash</h2>
<p>Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers' primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority.</p>
<p>Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:</p>

These restricted amounts are reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>26. LEASES</h2>
<p>The Company's operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding Citi's leases, see Notes 1 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities , respectively:</p>

<h2>27. CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<p>The following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosure in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Citigroup's First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q and in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.</p>
<p>In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.</p>
<p>If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At June 30, 2024, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.2 billion in the aggregate.</p>
<p>As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.</p>
<p>Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup's management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all</p>
<p>matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.</p>
<p>For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup's accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Payments required in any settlement agreements described above have been made or are covered by existing litigation or other accruals.</p>
<h2>28. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES</h2>
<p>Citigroup Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities</p>
<p>to the extent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.'s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 18). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.</p>

<p>Regulatory VAR: Daily aggregated VAR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.</p>
<p>Release: A net decrease in ACL through the provision for credit losses.</p>

<p>RWA: Risk-weighted assets. Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches), which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk for Advanced Approaches. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced Approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk weightings, which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches.</p>

<p>SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate</p>
<p>SPEs: Special purpose entities</p>
<p>Standardized Approach: Established through Basel III, the Standardized Approach aligns regulatory capital requirements more closely with the key elements of banking risk by introducing a wider differentiation of risk weights and a wider recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques, while avoiding excessive complexity. Accordingly, the Standardized Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual economic risks that banks are facing.</p>
<p>Tangible book value per share (TBVPS)*: Represents tangible common equity divided by EOP common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Tangible common equity (TCE): Represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, other than MSRs.</p>
<p>Taxable equivalent basis: Represents the total revenue, net of interest expense for the business, adjusted for revenue from investments that receive tax credits and the impact of tax-exempt securities. This metric presents results on a level comparable to taxable investments and securities. GAAP measures on taxable equivalent basis, including the metrics derived from these measures, are non-GAAP financial measures.</p>
<p>TDR: Troubled debt restructuring. Prior to January 1, 2023, a TDR was deemed to occur when the Company modified the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions were not TDRs. The accounting guidance for TDRs was eliminated with the adoption of ASU 202202. See "Accounting Changes" in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>TLAC: Total loss-absorbing capacity</h2>
<p>Total ACL: Allowance for credit losses, which comprises the allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL), allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC), allowance for credit losses on HTM securities and allowance for credit losses on other assets.</p>
<p>Total payout ratio*: Represents total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders.</p>

<p>Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury</p>
<p>VAR: Value at risk. A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.</p>
<p>VIEs: Variable interest entities</p>
<p>Wallet: Proportion of fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&amp;A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.</p>
