OVERVIEW
--------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (referred to herein as Citi's 2023 Form 10-K).

Throughout this report, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All "Note" references correspond to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, unless otherwise indicated.

For a list of certain terms and acronyms used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other Citigroup presentations, see "Glossary of Terms and Acronyms" at the end of this report.

Additional information about Citigroup is available on Citi's website at www.citigroup.com. Citigroup's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as well as other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge through Citi's website by clicking on "SEC Filings" under the "Investors" tab. The SEC's website also contains these filings and other information regarding Citi at www.sec.gov.

Please see "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
---------------------------

Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Citi believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results for investors, industry analysts and others, including increased transparency and clarity into Citi's results, and improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its businesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.

Citi's non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q include:

* · Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts
* · Expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment and divestiture-related impacts
* · All Other (managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts
* · Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)
* · Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges
* · NonMarkets net interest income

For more information on the FDIC special assessment, see "Executive Summary" below.

Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts represent as reported, or GAAP, financial results adjusted for items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi's previously announced exit markets within All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi's Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly reviews financial information for All Other on a managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more information on Citi's results excluding divestiture-related impacts, see "Executive Summary" and " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.

For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see "Capital Resources-Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity" below.

For more information on Banking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gains (losses) on loan hedges, see "Executive Summary" and " Banking " below.

For more information on nonMarkets net interest income, see "Market Risk-NonMarkets Net Interest Income" below.

Citigroup is managed pursuant to five operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking and Wealth. Activities not assigned to the operating segments are included in All Other . For additional information, see the results of operations for each of the operating segments within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------

First Quarter of 2024-Results Demonstrated Improved Business Performance and Progress Toward Citi's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the first quarter of 2024:

* · Citi's revenues decreased 2% versus the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts of approximately $1 billion, primarily consisting of a gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior-year period, revenues increased 3%, driven by growth across Banking , U.S. Personal Banking ( USPB ) and Services , partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth .
* · Citi's expenses increased 7% versus the prior-year period. The increase included repositioning costs of $258 million, an incremental FDIC special assessment of $251 million and net restructuring charges of $225 million. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both the current quarter and the prior-year period and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings (see "Expenses" below).
* · Citi's cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion versus $2.0 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB , largely reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, as well as the impact of the higher inflationary and interest rate environment, partially offset by a lower build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) in the current quarter (see "Cost of Credit" below).
* · Citi returned $1.5 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($1.0 billion) and share repurchases ($0.5 billion).
* · Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.5% as of March 31, 2024 (compared to 13.4% as of March 31, 2023) (see "Capital Resources" below). This compares to Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of March 31, 2024 and 12.0% as of March 31, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach.
* · Citi continued to make progress with the wind-downs of the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as the separation involving Citi's consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico in preparation for a planned initial public offering in 2025.

First Quarter of 2024 Results Summary
-------------------------------------

Citigroup
---------

Citigroup reported net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per share, compared to net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per share in the prior-year period. Net income decreased 27% versus the prior-year period, driven by the higher expenses, the higher cost of credit and the lower revenues. Citigroup's effective tax rate was approximately 25% in both the current and prior-year periods. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%.

Citigroup revenues of $21.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024 decreased 2% versus the prior-year period on a reported basis. Excluding the divestiturerelated impacts in both quarters, primarily consisting of the gain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior-year period, revenues of $21.1 billion increased 3%, driven by growth across Banking , USPB and Services , partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth . (For additional information on the divestiture-related impacts, see " All Other -Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)" below.) (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiturerelated impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.) Banking revenues reflected a recovery of the global investment banking wallet, Services revenues were driven by higher revenues in both Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services and USPB revenues benefited from strong loan growth in cards. The decline in Markets revenues was primarily due to lower Fixed Income markets revenues, while Wealth revenues were largely impacted by higher mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads.

Citigroup's end-of-period loans were $675 billion, up 3% versus the prioryear period, largely reflecting the growth in cards and mortgages in USPB and higher loans in Markets .

Citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 2% versus the prior-year period, largely due to a reduction in Services , reflecting quantitative tightening. For additional information about Citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business's results of operations and "Liquidity Risk-Deposits" below.

Expenses
--------

Citigroup's operating expenses of $14.2 billion increased 7% from the prioryear period. As discussed above, results for the first quarter of 2024 included the following notable items recorded in operating expenses in Corporate/Other within All Other (managed basis):

* · $251 million charge to operating expenses related to the FDIC's notification to Citi that it had increased its estimated loss attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (see Note 27)
* · $225 million of net restructuring charges related to actions taken as part of Citi's organizational simplification initiatives (see Note 9)

In the first quarter of 2024, expenses also included repositioning costs of $258 million and divestiture-related impacts of $110 million (compared to $73 million in the prior-year period). Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses increased 5% versus the prior-year period, driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment are non-GAAP financial measures.)

As previously announced, Citi expects to incur additional repositioning costs during the remainder of 2024.

Cost of Credit
--------------

Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $2.4 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services, largely reflecting continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, partially offset by a lower build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL). For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)" below.

Net credit losses of $2.3 billion increased 77% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.1 billion increased 67%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates. Corporate net credit losses increased to $164 million from $22 million.

As previously announced, Citi expects full-year net credit loss rates for both Branded Cards and Retail Services to be higher in 2024. The higher net credit loss expectations are already reflected in the ACL on loans for outstanding balances at March 31, 2024.

For additional information on Citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "Credit Risk" below.

Capital
-------

Citigroup's CET1 Capital ratio increased modestly to 13.5% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of March 31, 2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by net income, interest rate impacts on Citigroup's investment portfolio, impacts from the sales of certain Asia consumer banking (Asia Consumer) businesses and a decrease in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common dividends and share repurchases and higher disallowed deferred tax assets.

In the first quarter of 2024, Citi repurchased $0.5 billion of common shares and paid $1.0 billion of common dividends (see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below). Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarterly basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information on capital-related risks, trends and

uncertainties, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below and "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 31, 2024 was 5.8%, compared to 6.0% as of March 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital and an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, see "Capital Resources" below.

Services
--------

Services net income of $1.5 billion increased 15% from the prior-year period, largely driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. Services expenses of $2.7 billion increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million, compared to a net benefit of $14 million in the prior-year period.

Services revenues of $4.8 billion increased 8%, largely driven by continued momentum across TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads, and non-interest revenue increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers.

TTS revenues of $3.5 billion increased 5%, driven by a 4% increase in net interest income, primarily driven by higher spreads, and a 9% increase in noninterest revenue, reflecting continued growth in underlying drivers, including cross-border volumes, U.S. dollar clearing volumes and commercial card spend.

Securities Services revenues of $1.3 billion increased 18%, driven by a 16% increase in net interest income on higher deposit spreads, and a 21% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily driven by higher assets under custody and administration (AUC/AUA) balances from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding, and elevated corporate activity in Issuer Services.

For additional information on the results of operations of Services in the first quarter of 2024, see " Services " below.

Markets
-------

Markets net income of $1.4 billion decreased 25% from the prior-year period, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Markets expenses of $3.4 billion increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release in the prior-year period. Cost of credit increased to $200 million from $83 million in the prior-year period, reflecting a higher net ACL build, primarily driven by changes in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to loans in spread products, and higher net credit losses.

Markets revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 7%, driven by a 10% decrease in Fixed Income markets, partially offset by a 5% increase in Equity markets. The decrease in Fixed Income markets was largely driven by a decline in rates and currencies, largely reflecting lower volatility, decreased institutional client activity and a strong prior-year comparison, partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, up 26%, primarily reflecting an increase in client

activity. The increase in Equity markets was driven by growth in cash trading and higher equity derivatives revenues.

For additional information on the results of operations of Markets in the first quarter of 2024, see " Markets " below.

Banking
-------

Banking net income was $536 million, compared to $55 million in the prioryear period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, with cost of credit largely unchanged. Banking expenses of $1.2 billion decreased 4%, primarily driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base, partially offset by business-led investments.

Banking revenues of $1.7 billion increased 49%, driven by growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending, as well as lower losses on loan hedges. Excluding the losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.8 billion increased 35%. Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by the Debt Capital Markets (DCM) and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) businesses, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity. This increase in revenues was partially offset by lower Advisory revenues, reflecting the impact of lower merger activity announced in the second half of 2023. Corporate Lending revenues increased 68%, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the losses on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.)

For additional information on the results of operations of Banking in the first quarter of 2024, see " Banking " below.

U.S. Personal Banking
---------------------

USPB net income of $347 million decreased 14% from the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues. USPB expenses of $2.5 billion were largely unchanged, as lower compensation costs were offset by higher repositioning costs and volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.2 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased 74%, reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.

USPB revenues of $5.2 billion increased 10%, driven by higher net interest income due to loan growth in cards and higher non-interest revenue due to lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues of $2.6 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Retail Services revenues of $1.9 billion increased 18%, primarily driven by the lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as higher net interest income on higher loan balances. Retail Banking revenues of $638 million increased 1%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins, largely offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth .

For additional information on the results of operations of USPB in the first quarter of 2024, see " U.S. Personal Banking " below.

Wealth
------

Wealth net income was $150 million, compared to $159 million in the prioryear period, as lower revenues and higher expenses were largely offset by lower cost of credit. Wealth expenses increased 3% to $1.7 billion, driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by initial benefits from repositioning and restructuring actions. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, compared to a benefit of $58 million in the prior-year period, as net credit losses were more than offset by a higher net ACL release, reflecting a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.

Wealth revenues of $1.7 billion decreased 4%, largely driven by a 13% decrease in net interest income from higher mortgage funding costs and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by an 11% increase in non-interest revenue, largely reflecting higher investment fee revenues.

For additional information on the results of operations of Wealth in the first quarter of 2024, see " Wealth " below.

All Other (Managed Basis)
-------------------------

All Other (managed basis) net lossof $457 million, compared to net income of $198 million in the prior-year period, was primarily driven by higher expenses, lower revenues and lower income tax benefits, partially offset by lower cost of credit. All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.7 billion increased 18%, driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and the restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the closed exits and winddowns. Cost of credit of $185 million decreased 59%, largely driven by the absence of a net ACL build in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher net credit losses in Mexico Consumer.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 9% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher funding costs in Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues of $1.8 billion were largely unchanged from the prior-year period, as higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis), mainly due to higher volumes and Mexican peso appreciation, were offset by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis), reflecting the impacts of the closed exits and wind-downs.

For additional information on the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) in the first quarter of 2024, see " All Other -DivestitureRelated Impacts (Reconciling Items)" and " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
-----------------------------------------------

Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, continued elevated interest rates and inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, the Russia-Ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the Middle East. These and other factors have negatively impacted global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and have

resulted in a continued risk of recession in various regions and countries globally. In addition, these and other factors could adversely affect Citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2024.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024, see "First Quarter of 2024 Results Summary" above and each respective business's results of operations, "Managing Global Risk," including "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" and "-Argentina," and "Forward-Looking Statements" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net income of $1.5 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit.

Revenues increased 8%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities Services, largely driven by both net interest income and non-interest revenue growth.

TTS revenues increased 5%, reflecting 4% growth in net interest income and 9% increase in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher spreads, partially offset by lower deposits. The growth in non-interest revenue was largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 9%), U.S. dollar clearing volumes (up 3%) and commercial card spend (up 5%). Average deposits were down 3%, as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients.

Securities Services revenues increased 18%, due to 16% growth in net interest income, driven by higher deposit spreads, and 21% growth in noninterest revenue. The increase in non-interest revenue was driven by fee growth, primarily due to higher AUC/AUA balances from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding along with continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.

Expenses were up 11%, primarily driven by investments in technology, other risk and controls and product innovation.

Provisions were $64 million, compared to $(14) million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by an ACL build for loans, compared to a release in the prior-year period.

The net ACL build was primarily due to changes in loan portfolio mix. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

MARKETS
-------

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions . Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking -Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.

Markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net income of $1.4 billion decreased 25%, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower Fixed Income markets revenues, partially offset by higher Equity markets revenues.

Fixed Income markets revenues decreased 10%, reflecting a decline in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues decreased 21%, largely reflecting lower volatility, decreased institutional client activity and a strong prior-year performance. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 26%, driven by spread products, primarily due to increased client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. The increase was partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues.

Equity markets revenues increased 5%, driven by growth in cash equity trading, due to higher volumes and increased trading activity, and higher equity derivatives revenues, due to increased corporate client activity. Equity markets also continued to experience an increase in prime balances.

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by the absence of a legal reserve release in the prior-year period.

Provisions were $200 million, compared to $83 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build of $122 million, compared to $79 million in the prior-year period, and net credit losses of $78 million, compared to $4 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build was primarily driven by changes in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to loans in spread products.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net income was $536 million, compared to net income of $55 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses.

Revenues increased 49% (including losses on loan hedges), primarily reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues, driven by recovery of the global investment banking wallet, higher revenues in Corporate Lending and lower losses on loan hedges ($104 million loss versus $199 million loss in the prior-year period). Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues increased 35%.

Investment Banking revenues increased 35%, driven by the DCM and ECM businesses, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity. DCM underwriting fees increased 62%, driven by elevated debt issuance activity, particularly investment grade. ECM underwriting fees increased 57%, primarily driven by an increase in convertibles issuance. The increase in DCM and ECM underwriting fees was partially offset by lower Advisory fees (down 17%), driven by the impact of low merger activity announced in the second half of 2023.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 68%, including the impact of losses on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share.

Expenses decreased 4%, primarily driven by benefits from repositioning actions and other actions to lower the expense base, partially offset by business-led investments.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $129 million, compared to a benefit of $123 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses increased to $66 million, compared to $12 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL release was $195 million, compared to a net release of $135 million in the prior-year

period, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net income was $347 million, compared to $402 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 10%, due to higher net interest income (up 8%), largely driven by strong loan growth in cards, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 66%). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses.

Cards revenues increased 11%. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower card payment rates. Branded Cards card spend volumes increased 4%, driven by more affluent customers.

Retail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by higher noninterest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by higher net credit losses (see "Provisions" below and Note 5), as well as higher net interest income on higher loan balances. Retail Services average loans increased 6%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates, and credit card spend volumes decreased 4%, primarily due to lower in-store foot traffic.

Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, primarily driven by the higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins, largely offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth . Average mortgage loans increased 18%, primarily driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and mortgage originations exceeding prepayments. Average deposits decreased 10%, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth ($16 billion over the last 12 months).

Expenses were largely unchanged, as lower compensation costs were offset by higher repositioning costs and volume-related expenses.

Provisions were $2.2 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 74%, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. Branded Cards net credit losses were up 87% to $1 billion and Retail Services net credit losses were up 65% to $0.8 billion.

The net ACL build was $0.3 billion, compared to $0.6 billion in the prioryear period. The net ACL build in the current quarter primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment and the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers, partially offset by lower end-of-period cards balances.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net income of $150 million compared to $159 million in the prior-year period, as lower revenues and higher expenses were largely offset by lower cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower net interest income (down 13%), due to lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in non-interest revenue (up 11%), largely driven by higher investment fee revenues.

Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets (up 12%) across regions, reflecting the benefit of higher market valuations and net new investment asset flows.

Average loans were largely unchanged, as the business continued to optimize regulatory capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, primarily reflecting lower deposits in Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued transfers to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. This decrease in deposits was largely offset by the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from USPB ($16 billion over the last 12 months).

Private Bank revenues increased 1%, primarily driven by improved deposit spreads and investment fee revenues, largely offset by higher mortgage funding costs.

Wealth at Work revenues decreased 6%, driven by the lower deposit spreads and the higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by the higher investment fee revenues.

Citigold revenues decreased 6%, driven by the lower deposit spreads, partially offset by the higher investment fee revenues and higher deposit volumes.

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls and platform enhancements, partially offset by initial benefits from repositioning and restructuring actions.

Provisions were a benefit of $170 million, compared to a benefit of $58 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a higher net ACL release.

The higher net ACL release was primarily driven by a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates" below.

ALL OTHER-Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)
---------------------------------------------------------

All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments ( Services , Markets , Banking , USPB and Wealth ), including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see " All Other (Managed Basis)" below.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the "Reconciling Items" column in the table below) related to (i) Citi's divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed basis) are non-GAAP financial measures (see "Overview-Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis). The Reconciling Items are fully reflected on each respective line item in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income.

ALL OTHER-Managed Basis
-----------------------

At March 31, 2024, All Other (managed basis) had $200 billion in assets, primarily related to Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Asia Consumer reported within Legacy Franchises (managed basis), as well as Corporate Treasury investment securities and the Company's deferred tax assets (DTAs) reported within Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
---------------------------------

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes (i) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, (ii) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining four exit countries (Korea, Poland, China and Russia), and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets, primarily legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America that the Company continues to wind down.

Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial customers. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of its consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. Citi will retain its Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the businesses will be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) also included the following four Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: India and Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; Taiwan, until its closing in August 2023; and Indonesia until its closing in November 2023.

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in China, Korea and Russia, including in October 2023, when Citi announced the signing of an agreement to sell its onshore consumer wealth business in China. In addition, Citi has restarted the sales process of its consumer banking business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises' consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see "Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia" below and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

At March 31, 2024, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,343 retail branches, $20 billion in retail banking loans and $50 billion in deposits. In addition, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, while Mexico SBMM had $6 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances.

1Q24 vs. 1Q23
-------------

Net loss was $457 million, compared to net income of $198 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher expenses, lower revenues and lower income tax benefits, partially offset by lower cost of credit.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 9%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues were largely unchanged, as higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) were offset by lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues increased 21%, as cards revenues in Mexico Consumer increased 27%, SBMM revenues increased 28% and retail banking revenues increased 18%, mainly due to higher deposit and loan volumes and Mexican peso appreciation.

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 50%, primarily driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.

Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $571 million, compared to $812 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of funds.

Expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and the restructuring charges (see Note 9), partially offset by lower expenses from closed exits and wind-downs.

Provisions were $185 million, compared to $446 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by the absence of a net ACL build in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 26%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
-----------------

For additional information about capital resources, including Citi's capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the stress testing component of capital planning and current regulatory capital standards and developments, see "Capital Resources" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

During the first quarter of 2024, Citi returned a total of $1.5 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of $1.0 billion in dividends and $0.5 billion in share repurchases (approximately 8 million common shares). For additional information, see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends" below.

Citi paid common dividends of $0.53 per share for the first quarter of 2024, and on April 3, 2024, declared common dividends of $0.53 per share for the second quarter of 2024. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common dividend of at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors' approval. In addition, as previously announced, Citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, see "Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments" below.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio
----------------------------------

Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.5% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.0% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 12.1% as of December 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework.

Citi's CET1 Capital ratio increased under the Standardized Approach from December 31, 2023, driven primarily by net income and a decrease in Standardized Approach RWA, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders and higher deferred tax assets. Citi's CET1 Capital ratio decreased under the Advanced Approaches from December 31, 2023, driven primarily by the return of capital to common shareholders, an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA and higher deferred tax assets, partially offset by net income.

Stress Capital Buffer
---------------------

As of October 1, 2023, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio increased to 12.3% from 12.0% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.3% Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) through September 30, 2024 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) was unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.

For additional information regarding regulatory capital buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see "Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Buffers" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

As presented in the table above, Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.8% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The ratio increased slightly from the fourth quarter of 2023.

Capital Resources of Citigroup's Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citigroup's subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

The following tables present the capital components and ratios for Citibank, Citi's primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

| | | Advanced Approaches | Advanced Approaches | Standardized Approach | Standardized Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars, except ratios | Required Capital Ratios (1) | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |

| CET1 Capital ratio (4)(5) | 7.0 % | 14.04 % | 13.92 % | 15.35 % | 14.95 % |
| Tier 1 Capital ratio (4)(5) | 8.5 | 14.24 | 14.12 | 15.57 | 15.17 |
| Total Capital ratio (4)(5) | 10.5 | 15.35 | 15.20 | 17.55 | 17.13 |

| In millions of dollars, except ratios | Required Capital Ratios | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quarterly Adjusted Average Total Assets (2)(6) | | $ 1,680,951 | $ 1,666,609 |
| Total Leverage Exposure (2)(7) | | 2,151,044 | 2,166,334 |
| Leverage ratio (5) | 5.0 % | 9.00 % | 8.95 % |
| Supplementary Leverage ratio (5) | 6.0 | 7.03 | 6.89 |

As presented in the table above, Citibank's capital ratios at March 31, 2024 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was "well capitalized" as of March 31, 2024.

Citibank's Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.0% at March 31, 2024, compared to 6.9% at December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by net income in the first quarter of 2024 and a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, partially offset by adverse net movements in AOCI .

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios
----------------------------------------------------------

The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup's and Citibank's capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of March 31, 2024. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the

impact that a change in Citigroup's or Citibank's financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

| | CET1 Capital ratio | CET1 Capital ratio | Tier 1 Capital ratio | Tier 1 Capital ratio | Total Capital ratio | Total Capital ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In basis points | Impact of $100 million change in CET1 Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in risk- weighted assets | Impact of $100 million change in Tier 1 Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in risk- weighted assets | Impact of $100 million change in Total Capital | Impact of $1 billion change in risk- weighted assets |
| Citigroup | | | | | | |
| Advanced Approaches | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 1.2 |

| Citigroup | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.2 |
| Citibank | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.3 |

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
------------------------------------

At March 31, 2024, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC's net capital rule, of $19 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $14 billion.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of $27 billion at March 31, 2024, which exceeded the PRA's minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, certain of Citi's other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup's other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2024.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
------------------------------------

The table below details Citi's eligible external TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) amounts and ratios, and each TLAC and LTD regulatory requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement:

| | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars, except ratios | External TLAC | LTD |
| Total eligible amount | $ 334 | $ 151 |
| % of Advanced Approaches risk- weighted assets | 26.1 % | 11.8 % |
| Regulatory requirement (1)(2) | 22.5 | 9.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 46 | $ 29 |
| % of Total Leverage Exposure | 11.3 % | 5.1 % |
| Regulatory requirement | 9.5 | 4.5 |
| Surplus amount | $ 54 | $ 18 |

As of March 31, 2024, Citi exceeded each of the TLAC and LTD regulatory requirements, resulting in a $18 billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's TLAC-related requirements, see "Capital Resources-Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments GSIB Surcharge
------------------------------------------------------------

Basel III Revisions
-------------------

On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements.

The capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule's dualrequirement structure for risk-weighted assets, but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of risk-weighted assets. The capital proposal would also replace the current market risk framework with a new standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets for market risk. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints.

The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational risk-weighted asset amounts.

If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal's impact on risk-weighted asset amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see "GSIB Surcharge" below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would materially increase Citi's required regulatory capital.

For information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Compliance Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Separately on July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year's surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands.

Long-Term Debt Requirements
---------------------------

On August 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50% of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100%. These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.

Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Citi believes TCE, TBVPS and RoTCE provide alternative measures of returns, capital strength and performance for investors, industry analysts and others.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK
--------------------

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi's risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi's Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi's risk appetite. For more information on managing global risk at Citi, see "Managing Global Risk" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi's credit risk management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi's consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see "Credit Risk" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Loans
-----

The table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | 1Q24 | 4Q23 | 1Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Services | $ 82 | $ 83 | $ 79 |
| Markets | 120 | 115 | 111 |
| Banking | 89 | 89 | 95 |
| USPB | | | |
| Branded Cards | $ 108 | $ 107 | $ 97 |
| Retail Services | 52 | 52 | 49 |
| Retail Banking | 44 | 43 | 38 |
| Total USPB | $ 204 | $ 202 | $ 184 |
| Wealth | $ 150 | $ 150 | $ 150 |
| All Other | $ 34 | $ 36 | $ 35 |
| Total Citigroup loans (AVG) | $ 679 | $ 675 | $ 654 |
| Total Citigroup loans (EOP) | $ 675 | $ 689 | $ 652 |

End-of-period loans increased 3% year-over-year, largely reflecting growth in cards in USPB and Markets . End-of-period loans decreased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by seasonality in USPB.

On an average basis, loans increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely due to growth in USPB , Services and Markets , partially offset by a decline in Banking .

As of the first quarter of 2024, average loans for:

* · USPB increased 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services.
* · Wealth were largely unchanged.
* · Services increased 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS in North America and internationally.
* · Markets increased 8% year-over-year, reflecting increased client demand in asset-backed lending.
* · Banking decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by regulatory capital optimization efforts.

CORPORATE CREDIT

Portfolio Mix-Geography and Counterparty
----------------------------------------

Citi's corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage of this portfolio by region based on Citi's internal management geography:

| | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| North America | 57 % | 56 % | 56 % |
| International | 43 | 44 | 44 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:

| | Total exposure | Total exposure | Total exposure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2023 |
| AAA/AA/A | 50 % | 50 % | 50 % |
| BBB | 33 | 33 | 33 |
| BB/B | 16 | 16 | 15 |
| CCC or below | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi's interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2024. Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been observed.

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
----------------------------------

As of March 31, 2024, Citi's total credit exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $64 billion (compared to $66 billion at December 31, 2023), including $8 billion of exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of approximately $53 billion related to corporate clients, included in the real estate category in the table above, and approximately $11 billion related to Wealth clients that is not in the table above as they are not considered corporate exposures.

In addition, as of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of Citi's total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and more than 77% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of March 31, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the total funded CRE exposure (including Wealth ) was approximately 1.76%, and there were $678 million of non-accrual CRE loans.

The following table details Citi's corporate credit portfolio by industry as of December 31, 2023:

Credit Risk Mitigation
----------------------

As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, Banking had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $38.4 billion, $35.9 billion and $39.8 billion, respectively. Citi's expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

Rating of Hedged Exposure
-------------------------

| | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAA/AA/A | 45 % | 45 % | 42 % |

Consumer Credit Trends
----------------------

| U.S. Personal Banking | U.S. Personal Banking |
| --- | --- |
| | US Personal Banking.jpg |

As indicated above, USPB provides card products through Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans through Citi's Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as U.S. cards net credit losses represented approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses for the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, Branded Cards represented 68% of total U.S. cards EOP loans and Retail Services represented 32% of U.S. cards EOP loans.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in USPB increased quarter-overquarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as well as the macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.

| Branded Cards |
| --- |
| Branded Cards.jpg |

USPB 's Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and co-branded cards.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Branded Cards increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.

Retail Services
---------------

USPB 's Retail Services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail Services' target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Retail Services increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, with delayed losses due to unprecedented levels of government stimulus as well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi's cards portfolios, see each respective business's results of operations above and Note 14.

| Retail Banking |
| --- |
| Retail Banking.jpg |

USPB 's Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see "Loan-toValue (LTV) Ratios" in Note 14.

As presented in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Retail Banking for the first quarter of 2024 increased quarter-over-quarter, driven by consumer overdraft loans, and was broadly stable year-over-year.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.

| | Wealth |
| --- | --- |
| Wealth.jpg | |

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquencymanaged portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and cards.

As of March 31, 2024, approximately $44 billion, or 30%, of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 81% is rated investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Wealth was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The low net credit loss and 90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolio.

| Mexico Consumer | Mexico Consumer |
| --- | --- |
| Mexico Consumer.jpg | |

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss rates from postpandemic lows.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-overquarter and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization from post-pandemic lows.

| < 660 | 24 | 23 | 22 |
| Total | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % |

The FICO distribution of both card portfolios declined slightly from the prior quarter and the prior year, primarily reflecting continued maturation of cards loan vintages originated during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the portfolios. See Note 14 for additional information on FICO scores.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets
----------------------------

For additional information on Citi's non-accrual loans and assets, see "NonAccrual Loans and Assets" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
-----------------

The table below summarizes Citigroup's non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.

Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup's operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup's consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup's average HQLA decreased quarter-over-quarter as of the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings.

As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup had approximately $965 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($555 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($226 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi's HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($184 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi's major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi's LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | Mar. 31, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023 Mar. 31, 2023 | Mar. 31, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023 Mar. 31, 2023 | Mar. 31, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023 Mar. 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HQLA | $ 551.8 | $ 560.5 | $ 584.3 |
| Net outflows | 473.0 | 482.7 | 488.2 |
| LCR | 117 % | 116 % | 120 % |
| HQLA in excess of net outflows | $ 78.8 | $ 77.8 | $ 96.1 |

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup's average LCR increased from the quarter ended December 31, 2023. T he increase was primarily driven by t he decrease in net outflows, partially offset by the reduction in average HQLA. In addition, considering Citi's total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $965 billion, Citi maintained approximately $492 billion of excess liquidity resources above the stressed average net outflow of approximately $473 billion, presented in the LCR table above.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
----------------------------------------------------------------

As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a rule to assess the availability of a bank's stable funding against a required level.

In general, a bank's available stable funding includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding is required to be greater than 100%.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Citigroup's consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. Refer to Citi's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 on Citi's Investor Relations website for additional information.

Select Balance Sheet Items
--------------------------

This section provides details of select liquidity-related assets and liabilities reported on Citigroup's Consolidated Balance Sheet on an average and end-ofperiod basis.

Cash and Investments
--------------------

The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and due from banks , Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and Investment securities . Citi's investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. At March 31, 2024, Citi's EOP cash and Investment securities comprised approximately 32% of Citigroup's total assets:

| In billions of dollars | 1Q24 | 4Q23 | 1Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cash and due from banks | $ 27 | $ 27 | $ 28 |
| Deposits with banks | 252 | 252 | 326 |
| Investment securities | 516 | 516 | 516 |
| Total Citigroup cash and Investment securities (AVG) | $ 795 | $ 795 | $ 870 |
| Total Citigroup cash and Investment securities (EOP) | $ 788 | $ 780 | $ 842 |

Deposits
--------

The table below details the average deposits, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:

| In billions of dollars | 1Q24 | 4Q23 | 1Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Services | $ 808 | $ 803 | $ 830 |
| TTS | 684 | 681 | 705 |
| Securities Services | 124 | 122 | 125 |
| Markets | 24 | 23 | 23 |
| Banking | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| USPB | 100 | 105 | 111 |
| Wealth | 319 | 312 | 323 |
| All Other -Legacy Franchises | 48 | 48 | 49 |
| All Other -Corporate/Other | 26 | 28 | 26 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (AVG) | $ 1,326 | $ 1,320 | $ 1,363 |
| Total Citigroup deposits (EOP) | $ 1,307 | $ 1,309 | $ 1,330 |

End-of-period deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, largely due to a reduction in Services reflecting quantitative tightening. End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged sequentially.

On an average basis, deposits declined 3% year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially. In the first quarter of 2024, average deposits for:

* · Services decreased 3% year-over-year, as TTS and Securities Services decreased 3% and 1%, respectively. These declines primarily reflected the impact of quantitative tightening, partially offset by higher deposits from new client acquisitions and deepening of relationships with existing clients.
* · USPB decreased 10% year-over-year, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to Wealth .
* · Wealth decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower deposits in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work and the continued shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform, largely offset by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB .

Long-Term Debt
--------------

Weighted-Average Maturity (WAM)
-------------------------------

The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates' (including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

| WAM in years | Mar. 31, 2024 | Dec. 31, 2023 | Mar. 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unsecured debt | 7.4 | 7.5 | 7.5 |
| Non-bank benchmark debt | 6.9 | 7 | 7.2 |
| Customer-related debt | 8.6 | 8.6 | 7.9 |
| TLAC-eligible debt | 8.4 | 8.6 | 8.8 |

The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity where the option is not held by the issuer, the WAM is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

Long-Term Debt Outstanding
--------------------------

The following table presents Citi's end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:

| In billions of dollars | Mar. 31, 2024 | Dec. 31, 2023 | Mar. 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-bank (1) | | | |
| Benchmark debt: | | | |
| Senior debt | $ 111.0 | $ 110.3 | $ 117.1 |
| Subordinated debt | 27.2 | 24.9 | 22.7 |
| Trust preferred | 1.6 | 1.6 | 1.6 |
| Customer-related debt | 108.9 | 110.1 | 109.7 |
| Local country and other (2) | 7.4 | 8.0 | 8.7 |
| Total non-bank | $ 256.1 | $ 254.9 | $ 259.8 |
| Bank | | | |
| FHLB borrowings | $ 11.5 | $ 11.5 | $ 7.3 |
| Securitizations (3) | 6.7 | 6.7 | 6.6 |
| Citibank benchmark senior debt | 7.9 | 10.1 | 2.6 |
| Local country and other (2) | 3.3 | 3.4 | 3.4 |
| Total bank | $ 29.4 | $ 31.7 | $ 19.9 |
| Total long-term debt | $ 285.5 | $ 286.6 | $ 279.7 |

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.

Citi's total long-term debt outstanding increased 2% year-over-year, largely driven by issuance of subordinated debt in the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding was largely unchanged.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi's overall funding costs. During the first quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $9.4 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities
---------------------------------------

The table below details Citi's long-term debt issuances and maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the periods presented:

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings
------------------------------------------------------

Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.

Secured Funding Transactions
----------------------------

Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi's bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi's secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions.

Secured funding of $299 billion as of March 31, 2024 increased 16% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended March 31, 2024, on an average basis, secured funding was $311 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as "matched book" activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other "matched book" activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.

Short-Term Borrowings
---------------------

Citi's short-term borrowings of $32 billion as of March 31, 2024 decreased 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, both reflecting lower commercial paper issuances at the broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup's and its affiliates' outstanding short-term borrowings).

Credit Ratings
--------------

The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of March 31, 2024. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody's Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings as of March 31, 2024.

Ratings as of March 31, 2024
----------------------------

| | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citigroup Inc. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. | Citibank, N.A. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Long-term | Short-term | Outlook | Long- term | Short- term | Outlook |
| Fitch Ratings (Fitch) | A | F1 | Stable | A+ | F1 | Stable |
| Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) | A3 | P-2 | Stable | Aa3 | P-1 | Stable |
| S&P Global Ratings (S&P) | BBB+ | A-2 | Stable | A+ | A-1 | Stable |

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
---------------------------------------

Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody's or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup's and/or Citibank's funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see "Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks" and "Credit Ratings" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank-Potential Derivative Triggers
---------------------------------------------------------

As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.2 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023). Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank's funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023). Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.

In total, as of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.6 billion, compared to $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. As detailed under "High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)" above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank-Additional Potential Impacts
-------------------------------------

In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank's senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of March 31, 2024, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $11.1 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023) (see Note 21).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK
-----------

Market risk arises from both Citi's trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see "Market Risk-Overview" and "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS

Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi's net interest income and on Citi's Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital invested in foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk
-------------------------------

For interest rate risk purposes, Citi's non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi's Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management's Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi's risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup's Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the dayto-day management of Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi's Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi's net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi's Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:

* · Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments;
* · Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
* · Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
* · Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi's businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi's funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi's desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives.

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi's Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi's net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi's balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi's modeling and other factors.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts.

Citi's IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi's deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. EVS is a net present value (NPV)-based measure of the lifetime cash flows of Citi's Banking Book. It estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book's economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter-term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk limits approved by Citigroup's Board of Directors that are aligned with Citi's risk appetite.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios-Impact on AOCI
----------------------------------------------------------

Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI , which can in turn impact Citi's common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi's CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi's capital generation capacity.

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:

| In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted | Mar. 31, 2024 | Dec. 31, 2023 | Mar. 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel interest rate shock +100 bps | | | |
| Interest rate exposure (1)(2) | | | |
| U.S. dollar | $ (151) | $ (33) | $ 304 |
| All other currencies | 1,398 | 1,219 | 1,361 |
| Total | $ 1,247 | $ 1,186 | $ 1,665 |
| As a percentage of average interest-earning assets | 0.06 % | 0.05 % | 0.07 % |
| Estimated initial negative impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2) | $ (1,236) | $ (829) | $ (1,557) |
| Estimated initial impact on CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario (3) | (13) | (12) | (11) |

The All other currencies of $1,398 million as of March 31, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion each from the British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and South Korean won. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.

Citi's balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi's net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of March 31, 2024 was largely unchanged quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in Citi's balance sheet. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi's IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi's estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.2 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders' equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi's investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months.

Scenario Analysis
-----------------

The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of March 31, 2024. The 100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the "flooring assumption"). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.

| In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 | Scenario 5 | Scenario 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overnight rate change (bps) | 100 | 100 | - | - | (100) | (100) |
| 10-year rate change (bps) | 100 | - | 100 | (100) | - | (100) |
| Interest rate exposure | | | | | | |
| U.S. dollar | $ (151) | (241) $ | 115 | $ (95) $ | (197) $ | (324) |
| All other currencies (1) | 1,398 | 1,175 | 229 | (232) | (1,096) | (1,308) |
| Total | $ 1,247 | 934 $ | 344 | $ (327) $ | (1,293) $ | (1,632) |
| Estimated initial impact to AOCI (after-tax) (2) | $ (1,236) | (1,416) $ | 123 | $ (416) $ | 1,404 $ | 979 |
| Estimated initial impact to CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario | (13) | (10) | (4) | 2 | 10 | 12 |

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi's net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi's Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi's deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi's flooring assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi's investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi's pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates-Impacts on AOCI and Capital
-------------------------------------------------------------

As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi's tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi's CTA in AOCI , net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency

translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi's net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi's risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

This, coupled with Citi's foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi's CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi's capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.

The effect of Citi's ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi's TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for additional information on the changes in AOCI .

| Non- Markets net interest income-taxable equivalent basis (1) | $ 11,794 $ | 11,830 $ | 11,786 | - % |

Citi's net interest income in the first quarter of 2024 was $13.5 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, an increase of $0.1 billion versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by Markets. The increase in Markets net interest income was primarily driven by Fixed Income markets. NonMarkets net interest income was largely unchanged, as the impact from higher interest rates and the growth in U.S. cards interest-earning balances in USPB were offset by higher funding costs in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in Corporate Treasury within All Other .

Citi's net interest margin was 2.42% on a taxable equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of four basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by Fixed Income markets.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS
---------------------------------

Value at Risk (VAR)
-------------------

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and longterm (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of March 31, 2024, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 30% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2023, the add-on was 30%.

As presented in the table below, Citi's average trading VAR for the first quarter of 2024 increased 10% from the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to inventory changes in the Markets businesses and updates to reflect changes in volatilities.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
---------------------------

In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi's VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.

As of March 31, 2024, there were two back-testing exceptions observed for Citi's Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

Country Risk
------------

Top 25 Country Exposures
------------------------

The following table presents Citi's top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2024. (Including the U.S., Citi's top 25 exposures by country would represent approximately 99% of Citi's exposure to all countries as of March 31, 2024.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries,

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 40% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (45% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of March 31, 2024.

Trading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.

See " All Other -Legacy Franchises" above and Note 2.

Russia
------

Overview
--------

In Russia, Citi's remaining operations are conducted through Services , Markets , Banking and All Other -Legacy Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi significantly reduced its All Other -Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank.

Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as continue to support its employees, during this period. For additional information, see "Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations" below.

For additional information about Citi's risks related to its Russia exposures, see "Risk Factors-Market-Related Risks," "-Operational Risks" and "-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Impact of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine on Citi's Businesses
-----------------------------------------------------------

Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures
--------------------------------------

Citi's remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency.

The following table summarizes Citi's exposures related to its Russia operations:

| In billions of U.S. dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2023 | Change 1Q24 vs. 4Q23 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loans | $ 0.1 | $ 0.1 | 0.4 $ | - |
| Investment securities (1) | 0.3 | 0.4 | 1.0 | (0.1) |
| Net MTM on derivatives/repos | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.0 | - |
| Total hedges (on loans and CVA) | - | - | (0.1) | - |
| Unfunded (2) | - | - | 0.1 | - |
| Trading accounts assets | - | - | - | - |
| Country risk exposure | $ 1.8 | $ 1.9 | 2.4 $ | (0.1) |
| Cash on deposit and placements (3) | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.9 | (0.2) |
| Deposit Insurance Agency (4) | 4.6 | 3.9 | - | 0.7 |
| National Settlements Depository (4) | - | - | 2.7 | - |
| Total third-party exposure (5) | $ 6.9 | $ 6.5 | 6.0 $ | 0.4 |
| Additional exposures to Russian counterparties that are not held by the Russian subsidiary | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | - |
| Total Russia exposure (6) | $ 7.0 | $ 6.6 | 6.1 $ | 0.4 |

During the first quarter of 2024, Citi's Russia-related exposures increased by $0.4 billion, as presented in the table above. The increase in exposure was driven by inflows from dividends received from Russian corporations on behalf of Citi's clients. Approximately 73% of Citi's $7.0 billion of total Russia exposure are corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government, of which $4.6 billion is held with the Deposit Insurance Agency as of March 31, 2024.

Citi's net investment in Russia was approximately $0.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 (unchanged from December 31, 2023).

Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI . When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD equivalent value of Citigroup's investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net rubledenominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi's Businesses
-----------------------------------------------

Services , Markets , Banking , USPB and All Other results have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi's businesses, see "Executive Summary" and each business's results of operations above.

As of March 31, 2024, Citigroup's ACL included a $0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi's direct Russian counterparties (largely unchanged from December 31, 2023). This balance does not include the additional reserves for transfer risk for exposures in Russia.

Citi's Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
-----------------------------------------

In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $65 million to-date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $54 million in estimated charges (approximately $1 million in Banking and $53 million in All Other , excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). This estimate was revised down during the first quarter of 2024 from $58 million at December 31, 2023. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and "Risk Factors" and "Managing Global Risk-Other RisksCountry Risk-Russia" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
--------------------

Citi's remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (see "Risk Factors-Other Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of March 31, 2024, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi's foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately $0.2 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.6 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2023) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients
-----------------------------------------------

Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi's role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions' sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or

block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
------------------

Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi's response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi's reputation with some or all of these parties.

For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi's inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi's actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi's activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi's reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi's continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations.

Board's Role in Overseeing Related Risks
----------------------------------------

The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board's Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi's operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as the war's broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts. The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the international cluster, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has also provided updates to Citi's Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding Citi's Russia-related risks, including with respect to cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
-------

Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 220 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi's top priority. All of Citi's domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of March 31, 2024, Citi had $1.4 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023).

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Argentina
---------

Citi operates in Argentina through its Services , Markets and Banking businesses. As of March 31, 2024, Citi's net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023). Citi uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)denominated assets directly in earnings. Citi uses Argentina's official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of March 31, 2024, the official ARS exchange rate was 858.00, which devalued by 6% against the USD during the first quarter of 2024.

The increase in Citi's net investment in Argentina during the quarter was primarily due to earnings associated with increased client activity, Citi's normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment, of which a significant portion is invested at high local overnight rates in Argentina. All of these effects significantly exceeded translation losses (net of hedges) of $55 million recognized during the quarter.

The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi's ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. To the extent that such controls remain in place, Citi's net investment in Argentina will, as a result, continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency translation losses if it is denominated in ARS and is unable to be remitted or exchanged. Furthermore, the capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina's official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is generally precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure Citi's net monetary assets into USD. If Argentina's official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations.

Of the $1.6 billion net investment in Argentina as of March 31, 2024, Citi's net ARS exposure was approximately $0.9 billion. The net ARS exposure was reduced as of the end of the quarter as a result of Citi holding approximately $100 million of USD-denominated loans as well as approximately $600 million of certain local government bonds that are indexed to the higher of the USD exchange rate or the local inflation index. If Citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the first quarter of 2024. Given current economic conditions and the local capital, currency and regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure in the future.

In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of March 31, 2024, Citi was unable to hedge a substantial portion of the remaining ARS exposure, given that the

offshore NDF market remained illiquid. Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute additional NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings.

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-tomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of March 31, 2024. For additional information on Citi's emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see "Risk FactorsStrategic Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
---------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of Citi's most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup's significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi's results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also "Risk Factors-Operational Risks" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Valuations of Financial Instruments
-----------------------------------

Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets , Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities .

Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement . If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI .

Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likelythan-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI . Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.

For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an otherthan-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.

The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi's own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi's fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
----------------------------------------

The table below presents Citi's allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and total ACL as of the first quarter of 2024. For information on the drivers of Citi's ACL build in the first quarter of 2024, see below. For additional information on Citi's accounting policy on accounting for credit losses under ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses; Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) , see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

| Total ACL | $ 21,756 | $ 35 | $ (38) | $ 21,753 | | |

Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi's reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets . These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi's ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R&S

timeframe. The R&S forecast period for consumer and corporate loans is eight quarters.

The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forwardlooking macroeconomic forecast scenarios-base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and certain economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.

Quantitative Component
----------------------

Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.

For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi's expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.

In addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.

Qualitative Component
---------------------

The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:

* · Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
* · Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions
* · Normalization of portfolio performance and consumer behavior from low losses as a result of government stimulus and market liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic

As of the first quarter of 2024, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL decreased quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by (i) a release of COVID-19-related uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and losses continue to increase and as these risks are captured in the quantitative component of the ACL, and (ii) a release related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.

Macroeconomic Variables
-----------------------

As further discussed below, Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probabilityweighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.

The tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 1Q23 to 1Q24:

| | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | Quarterly average | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. unemployment | 2Q24 | 4Q24 | 2Q25 | 8-quarter average (1) | |
| Citi forecast at 1Q23 | 4.6 % | 4.5 % | 4.4 % | 4.3 | % |
| Citi forecast at 2Q23 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.4 | 4.3 | |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 4.3 | 4.4 | 4.3 | 4.2 | |
| Citi forecast at 4Q23 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 4.3 | 4.2 | |
| Citi forecast at 1Q24 | 3.9 | 4.1 | 4.1 | 4.0 | |

| | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) | Year-over-year growth rate Full year (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. real GDP | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
| Citi forecast at 1Q23 | 1.0 % | 1.0 % | 2.0 % |
| Citi forecast at 2Q23 | 1.3 | 0.7 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 3Q23 | 2.1 | 1.0 | 2.0 |
| Citi forecast at 4Q23 | 2.4 | 1.4 | 1.7 |
| Citi forecast at 1Q24 | 2.5 | 2.3 | 1.8 |

Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 1Q24, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to decline during 2024, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the eight-quarter forecast horizon, broadly returning to pre-pandemic levels.

Scenario Weighting
------------------

Citi's ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios-base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.

Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi's downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.4% in the third quarter of 2025. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2024 of 0.8%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.3%.

Citi's ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of March 31, 2024 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple macroeconomic scenarios. Citi's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $5.4 billion related to

lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.

This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of March 31, 2024.

1Q24 Changes in the ACL
-----------------------

As further discussed below, Citi's ending ACL balance for the first quarter of 2024 was $21.8 billion, largely unchanged from December 31, 2023. The net build of less than $0.1 billion in the quarter was primarily driven by (i) a build of $0.3 billion in USPB , reflecting the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment, as well as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers in U.S. cards, and (ii) a build of $0.1 billion in Markets , due to changes in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to loans in spread products. These builds were largely offset by (i) a $0.2 billion release in Wealth , driven by a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio, and (ii) a release of $0.1 billion for changes in portfolio composition in Banking . Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of March 31, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.

Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
---------------------------------------------

Citi's consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in USPB . Citi's total consumer ACLL build was $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment, as well as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers, largely offset by a release in Wealth driven by a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio. This resulted in a March 31, 2024 ACLL balance of $15.5 billion, or 4.07% of total funded consumer loans.

For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased to 8.16% at March 31, 2024, primarily related to seasonal volume and mix changes, as well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment, compared to 7.67% at December 31, 2023. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.16% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.25% at December 31, 2023.

Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
----------------------------------------------

Citi had a corporate ACLL build of $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, largely driven by Markets due to the changes in macroeconomic variable assumptions related to loans in spread products, largely offset by changes in the portfolio composition in Banking . This resulted in a March 31, 2024 ACLL balance of $2.8 billion, or 0.97% of total funded corporate loans.

ACLUC
-----

Citi had an ACLUC release of $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, which reduced the ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities , to $1.6 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by a release for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.

ACL on Other Financial Assets
-----------------------------

Citi had an ACL build of less than $0.1 billion on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the first quarter of 2024. Including FX/Other, the ACL reserve balance decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. See Note 15 for additional information.

Regulatory Capital Impact
-------------------------

Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies' final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.

See Notes 1 and 15 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.

Goodwill
--------

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi's stock price.

The impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the fair values of Citi's reporting units exceeding their carrying values for all reporting units. Additionally, the tests results showed that the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 106%, with the carrying value including approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.

While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi's management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 16 for a further discussion of goodwill.

Litigation Accruals
-------------------

See the discussion in Note 27 for Citi's policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies.

INCOME TAXES
------------

Effective Tax Rate
------------------

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars, except effective tax rate | 2024 | 2024 | 2024 | | 2023 | 2023 | |
| Income from continuing operations before income tax expense | | | | | | | |
| | | $ | 4,544 $ | | | 6,183 | |
| Effective tax rate | | | | | | | |
| Provision for income taxes | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 | 1,136 1,531 |
| | 25 | | | % | 25 | % | |

Citi's effective tax rate was 25% in the first quarter of 2024 versus 25% in the first quarter of 2023, both including the impact of divestitures.

Deferred Tax Assets
-------------------

For additional information on Citi's deferred tax assets (DTAs), see "Capital Resources," "Risk Factors-Strategic Risks," "Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Income Taxes" and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The table below summarizes Citi's net DTAs balance:

| Jurisdiction/Component | DTAs balance | DTAs balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In billions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| Total U.S. | $ 26.4 | $ 26.3 |
| Total foreign | 3.5 | 3.3 |
| Total | $ 29.9 | $ 29.6 |

At March 31, 2024, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $29.9 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2023 and an increase of $2.3 billion from March 31, 2023. The increase for the first quarter was from temporary differences and the year-over-year increase was primarily a result of Citi's geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi's $29.9 billion of net DTAs, $14.1 billion (compared to $12.8 billion at December 31, 2023) was deducted in calculating Citi's regulatory capital, and the remaining $15.8 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.

The $14.1 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.9 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $3.6 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.4 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.

DTA Realizability
-----------------

Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of $29.9 billion at March 31, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on management's expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
----------------------------------

Citi's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Citi's Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi's disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.

Citi's management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such activities.

During the first quarter of 2024, Citigroup identified one transaction that was reportable pursuant to Section 219. On January 12, 2024, Citibank, N.A. processed a transaction between the Central Bank of Iran (the CBI) and an international organization. The CBI sent funds in yen, through Citibank, N.A., Tokyo Branch, which were then converted to U.S. dollars and transferred to the international organization's U.S. dollar (USD) account at Citibank, N.A., New York Branch. The total value of the payment was USD 19,616,884.32. The transaction represented a payment for the Government of Iran's membership dues to the international organization and was processed pursuant to general licenses issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Citibank realized approximately USD 5,905.00 for incoming and outgoing payments fees and a foreign exchange transaction fee.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
--------------------------

Certain statements in this Form 10-Q, including but not limited to statements included within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Citigroup may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.

Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent Citigroup's and its management's beliefs regarding future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target, outlook, guidance and illustrative, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the precautionary statements included within the "Executive Summary" and each business's discussion and analysis of its results of operations above and in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K and in Citi's other SEC filings; (ii) the factors listed and described under "Risk Factors" in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K; and (iii) the risks and uncertainties summarized below:

* · the potential impact to Citi from continued macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatility, including, among others, government fiscal and monetary actions or expected actions, such as maintaining high interest rates, continued reductions in central bank balance sheets, or other restrictive interest rate or other monetary policies; a resurgence of inflation; potential recessions in the U.S., Europe and other regions or countries; geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related to Russia's war in Ukraine and persistent and/or escalating conflicts in the Middle East; economic and other geopolitical challenges related to China, including weak economic growth, challenges in its real estate sector, banking and credit markets and tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan and/or involving China and/or China and the U.S.; significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets, including foreign currency volatility and devaluations and continued strength in the U.S. dollar; protracted or widespread trade tensions; and election outcomes;
* · the potential impact on Citi's ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, due to, among other things, regulatory capital requirements, including annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer, which is based on the results of the CCAR process, recalibration of the GSIB surcharge, and
* supervisory expectations and assessments, including any negative findings regarding absolute capital levels or other aspects of Citi's operations; changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations, such as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), changes to the method for calculating the GSIB surcharge and changes to aspects of the total lossabsorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements; Citi's results of operations and financial condition, including the capital impact related to Citi's remaining divestitures; Citi's effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio; Citi's implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; and Citi's DTA utilization;
* · the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes faced by financial institutions, including Citi, in the U.S. and globally, such as potential changes to various aspects of the U.S. regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to Citi; potential fiscal, monetary, tax, sanctions and other changes, including potential increased regulatory requirements and costs, such as potential changes in regulatory requirements relating to interest rate risk management; rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the EU, the U.S. and globally relating to climate change and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) areas that vary and may conflict across jurisdictions, including any new disclosure requirements; and the potential impact these uncertainties and changes could have on Citi's businesses, results of operations, financial condition, business planning and compliance risks and costs;
* · Citi's ability to achieve its objectives, including expense savings and revenue growth, from its transformation, organizational simplification and other strategic and other initiatives, which involve significant complexities, execution challenges and uncertainties, may not be as productive or effective as Citi expects or at all, may result in higher than expected expenses, litigation and regulatory scrutiny, CTA and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material, and depend, in part, on factors that Citi cannot control, including, among others, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties, customer, client and competitor actions and ongoing regulatory requirements or changes;
* · the potential impact to Citi from climate change due to both physical risks, including acute risks as well as the consequences of chronic changes in climate, and transition risks, including those arising from regulatory, market, technological, stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy, such as increased regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs, including those associated with the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the SEC's climate disclosures rules (currently stayed), whether due to lack of information and reliable data, interpretive uncertainties or otherwise;
* · Citi's ability to utilize its DTAs and thus reduce the negative impact of the DTAs on Citi's regulatory capital, including as a result of its ability to generate U.S. taxable income in the relevant reversal periods;
* · the potential impact to Citi if its interpretation or application of the complex income-based and non-income-based (such as withholding, stamp, service and other non-income taxes) tax laws to which it is subject in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions differs from those of the relevant governmental taxing authorities, including as a result of litigation or examinations regarding non-income-based tax matters, and the resulting payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, the reduction of certain tax benefits or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded;
* · the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain Citi's co-branding or private label credit card relationships, due to, among other things, increasing competition among card issuers; the general economic environment; changes in consumer sentiment, spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors; a decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; early termination of a particular relationship; or other factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, whether due to the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise;
* · Citi's ability to address any shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance provided by the FRB or FDIC on its resolution plan submissions;
* · the potential impact on Citi's performance and the performance of its individual businesses, including its competitive position and ability to effectively manage its businesses, and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives, if Citi is unable to hire and retain qualified employees, particularly given the highly competitive environment for talent and other factors, such as potential attrition driven by Citi's organizational simplification initiatives, low unemployment, changes in worker expectations and regulation of employee compensation in the banking industry;
* · Citi's ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and globally with both financial and non-financial services firms, including as a result of certain competitors being subject to less stringent legal and regulatory requirements; the introduction of mobile platforms and new or emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence-driven solutions; potential mergers and acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers; changes in the payments space; reliance on third parties for certain product and service offerings and any impact if a third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings; and the increased operational, compliance and other risks resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt existing products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively;
* · the potential impact to Citi from a prior or future failure or disruption of its operational processes or systems, including as a result of, among other things, operational or execution failures, or deficiencies by third parties, including third parties that provide products or services to Citi, other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with Citi; deficiencies in processes or controls; inadequate management of data governance practices, data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decision-making; cyber or information security incidents; human error, such as manual transaction processing errors, which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failure of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure; other similar losses or damage to Citi's property or assets; potential disruptions and/or malfunctions within Citi's businesses, as well as the operations of Citi's clients, customers or other third parties; and the increased financial and other costs and reputational, legal and compliance risks resulting from any such failure or disruption of operational processes or systems, including legal and regulatory actions or proceedings, fines and other costs;
* · the increasing risk to Citi's and third parties' computer systems, software and networks from ongoing, continually evolving, sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in, among other things, theft, loss, non-availability, misuse or disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary Citi, client, customer or employee information or assets and a disruption of computer, software or network systems; and the potential impact from such risks, including reputational damage, regulatory penalties, loss of revenues, deposit flight, additional costs (including repair, replacement, remediation and other costs), exposure to litigation and other financial losses;
* · the potential impact of changes or errors in accounting assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of certain accounting principles, related to the preparation of Citi's financial statements, including the estimate of Citi's ACL, which depends on its CECL models and assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and characteristics of Citi's loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets; reserves related to litigation, regulatory and tax matters; valuation of DTAs; the fair values of certain assets and liabilities; the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment; and the financial impact from reclassification of any CTA component of AOCI into Citi's earnings due to a sale, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event,
* such as those related to Citi's remaining consumer banking divestitures or other legacy businesses;
* · the impact of changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations of how Citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations;
* · the potential impact to Citi's results of operations and/or regulatory capital and capital ratios if Citi's risk management and other processes, strategies or models, including, among others, those related to its comprehensive stress testing initiatives or ability to adequately manage, assess and aggregate data, are deficient or ineffective; Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models require refinement, modification or enhancement; or any negative regulatory evaluation or examination finding is issued or enforcement action is taken by Citi's U.S. banking regulators;
* · the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of risk on Citi's results of operations, including due to a default by or a significant downgrade in credit ratings of consumer, corporate or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, such as from indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions, including hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi's inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries impacted by macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges and uncertainties and volatilities;
* · the potential impact on Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity or due to various other factors, including, among others, general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies and regulatory requirements; negative investor perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; competition for funding, including a decrease in demand for corporate debt securities; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; changes in Citi's credit spreads; high interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;
* · the impact of a credit ratings downgrade of Citi or certain of its subsidiaries or issuing entities on Citi's funding and liquidity as well as on the operations of certain of its businesses;
* · the potential impact to Citi of significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally and ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes, with respect to, among other things, governance, infrastructure, data, risk management practices and controls, customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering, increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes and various regulatory reporting requirements, including the impact on Citi's compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs, such as increased regulatory oversight, material restrictions, including, among others, imposition of additional capital buffers and
* limitations on capital distributions, enforcement proceedings, penalties and fines;
* · the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the previously disclosed October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risk and controls, such as enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; Citi's ability to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements to comply with the consent orders, which will continue to require significant investments to meet regulatory expectations; and the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies that may be sought by regulators, such as large civil monetary penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends, changes to directors and/or officers and significant collateral consequences arising from such outcomes; and
* · the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in the emerging markets, including, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; strength in the U.S. dollar; sustained elevated interest rates and quantitative tightening; elevated inflation and hyperinflation; foreign exchange controls, including the inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; macroeconomic, geopolitical and domestic political challenges and uncertainties and volatility; cyberattacks; restrictions arising from retaliatory laws and regulations; sanctions or asset freezes; sovereign debt volatility; fluctuations in commodity prices; election outcomes; regulatory changes, including potential conflicts among regulations with other jurisdictions where Citi does business; limitations on foreign investment; sociopolitical instability; civil unrest; crime, corruption and fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; potential criminal charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; confiscation of assets; and the need to record additional reserves for expected losses for credit exposures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date that the forward-looking statements were made.

At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1 billion, which was recorded in AOCI upon transfer.

The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
------------------------------------------------------

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES

---

Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2024 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include the accounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included within Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K).

Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.

Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While management uses its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates.

As noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited.

Throughout these Notes, "Citigroup," "Citi" and "the Company" refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods' financial statements and notes to conform to the current period's presentation. Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
------------------

Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions.

Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial statements of the Company.

Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
---------------------------------------------------

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expands the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as components of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the Company to elect to use the proportional amortization method to account for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized investments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the financial statements of the Company.

TDRs and Vintage Disclosures
----------------------------

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and measurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.

Adopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of $352 million and an increase in other assets related to held-for-sale businesses of $44 million, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $290 million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of $106 million on January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement approach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this ASU.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

ASU 2022-02 eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With the elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably expected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term over which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for modified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be based on the fair value of the collateral.

Consumer Loans
--------------

Upon adoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the use of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all consumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate discounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the borrowers' probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi collectively evaluates smaller-balance homogeneous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected credit losses, whereas previously those loans had been individually evaluated.

The ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of those types of modifications. In addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to disclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 13 for these new disclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.

Long-Duration Insurance Contracts
---------------------------------

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial ServicesInsurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12.

Citi adopted the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $39 million decrease in Other liabilities and a $27 million increase in AOCI , after-tax.

Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio Layer Method
-----------------------------------------

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio Layer Method , intended to better align hedge accounting with an organization's risk management strategies. Specifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed portfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable and non-prepayable assets. Upon the adoption of the guidance, entities may elect to reclassify securities held-to-maturity to the available-for-sale category provided that the reclassified securities are designated in a portfolio hedge. Coincident with the adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred HTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair value of approximately $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and hedged them under the portfolio layer method.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES
-------------------------

Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
----------------------------------------------

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity's crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and changes during the reporting period. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. Citi does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the guidance.

Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
----------------------------------------------------------------

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public business entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws or tax credits; effect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and

by jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative threshold. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.

Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended to improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and all segments' profit or loss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis. The amendments also clarified that public entities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment's profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.

The ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective basis and will be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2024 and interim periods for the interim period beginning on January 1, 2025. Citi is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its disclosure of reportable segments and related disclosures.

1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITS

---

Summary of Discontinued Operations
----------------------------------

The Company's results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within All Other .

The Company's Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $(1) million and $(1) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented.

Other Business Exits
--------------------

Wind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking Business
--------------------------------------------

On October 25, 2021, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business, which is reported in the All Other -Legacy Franchises operating segment. In connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) commenced a voluntary early termination program (Korea VERP). Due to the voluntary nature of this termination program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then irrevocably accepted by those employees. Related charges are recorded as Compensation and benefits .

The following table summarizes the reserve charges related to the Korea VERP and other initiatives reported in the All Other operating segment:

| In millions of dollars | Employee termination costs |
| --- | --- |
| Total Citigroup (pretax) | |
| Original charges in fourth quarter 2021 | $ 1,052 |
| Utilization | (1) |
| Foreign exchange | 3 |
| Balance at December 31, 2021 | $ 1,054 |
| Additional charges in first quarter 2022 | $ 31 |
| Utilization | (347) |
| Foreign exchange | (24) |

| Additional charges (releases) | $ (3) |
| Utilization | (670) |
| Foreign exchange | (41) |
| Balance at June 30, 2022 | $ - |

Note: There were no additional charges after June 30, 2022.

The total cash charges for the wind-down were $1.1 billion through 2022, most of which were recognized in 2021. Citi does not expect to record any additional charges in connection with the Korea VERP.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K for details on the pension impact of the Korea wind-down.

Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking Businesses
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On August 25, 2022, Citi announced its decision to wind down its consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the wind-down, Citi is also actively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking portfolios.

On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it would end nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi's only operations in Russia are those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.

Portfolio Sales
---------------

* · During the second quarter of 2023, Citi recorded an incremental gain of $5 million related to post-closing contingency payments for the previously disclosed personal installment loan sale in Other revenue. The previously disclosed sale of a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment loans resulted in a pretax net loss on sale of approximately $7 million.
* · During the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, as part of the previously disclosed cards referral agreement with a Russian bank, approximately $52 million of credit card receivables were settled upon referral and refinanced.

Wind-Down Charges

1. OPERATING SEGMENTS

---

The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.

Citi is organized into five reportable operating segments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and Wealth , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations. See operating segment details in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain customer balances between All OtherLegacy Franchises, Services , Markets and Banking in preparation for the IPO of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial reclassifications. These reallocations and reclassifications did not materially change segment results and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi's consolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from All Other based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.

Revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components are treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding charges paid by operating segments and funding credits received by Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in net interest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations within All Other to reconcile the operating segment results to Citi's consolidated results.

The accounting policies of these reportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The following tables present certain information regarding the Company's continuing operations by reportable operating segments and All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-related impacts. Performance measurement is based on Income (loss) from continuing operations. These results are used by the CODM, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments:

Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income related to trading activities, which is an integral part of the profitability of trading activities (see Note 4 for information about net interest income related to trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in Services , Markets and Banking . These adjustments are discussed further in Note 23.

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

1. RESTRUCTURING

---

As previously disclosed, Citi is pursuing various initiatives to simplify the Company and further align its organizational structure with its business strategy. As part of its overall simplification initiatives, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi eliminated the previous Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth Management layers, exited certain institutional business lines, and consolidated its regional structure, creating one international group, while centralizing client capabilities and streamlining its global staff functions. Citi recorded approximately $781 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the initial implementation of its organizational simplification initiatives.

During the first quarter of 2024, Citi incurred additional net restructuring charges of approximately $225 million related to the continued implementation of its organizational simplification initiatives. Citi has recorded net restructuring charges of approximately $1.0 billion program-todate.

Restructuring charges are recorded as a separate line item within Operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. These charges were included within All Other -Corporate/Other.

The following costs associated with these initiatives are included in restructuring charges:

* · Personnel costs: severance costs associated with actual headcount reductions (as well as those that were probable and could be reasonably estimated)
* · Other: costs associated with contract terminations and other direct costs associated with the restructuring, including asset write-downs (non-cash write-downs of capitalized software, which are included in Premises and equipment related to exited businesses)

The following table is a rollforward of the liability related to the restructuring charges:

It is the Company's policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.

HTM Debt Securities Delinquency and Non-Accrual Details

Evaluating Investments for Impairment-AFS Debt Securities
---------------------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company's intent to sell such securities.

For more information on evaluating investments for impairment, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Recognition and Measurement of Impairment
-----------------------------------------

The following table presents total impairment on AFS investments recognized in earnings:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company intends to sell, would more-likely-than-not be required to sell or will be subject to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise | 14 $ | 51 |

Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities
--------------------------------------------------

The allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was $9 million and $8 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at
-----------------------------------------------

Fair Value
----------

Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to fair value through earnings.

Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at March 31, 2024 and De cember 31, 2023:

| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- |
| Measurement alternative: | |
| Carrying value | $ 1,706 $ 1,639 |

Below are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Measurement alternative : (1) | | |
| Impairment losses | $ 16 | $ 35 |
| Downward changes for observable prices | - | 20 |
| Upward changes for observable prices | 49 | 30 |

| In millions of dollars | Life-to-date amounts on securities still held March 31, 2024 |
| --- | --- |
| Measurement alternative: | |
| Impairment losses | 351 |
| Downward changes for observable prices | 34 |
| Upward changes for observable prices | 999 |

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost.

Defaults of Modified Corporate Loans
------------------------------------

No modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due. For a modified corporate loan that is not collateral dependent, expected default rates are considered in the loan's individually assessed ACL.

Consumer Loans
--------------

Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by USPB , Wealth and All Other -Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM). The tables below present details about these loans, including the following loan categories:

* · Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans primarily represent secured mortgage lending to customers of Retail Banking and Wealth .
* · Credit cards primarily represent unsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded Cards and Retail Services.
* · Personal, small business and other loans are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to customers of Wealth (mostly within the Private Bank) who are typically high credit quality borrowers that historically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized in the form of liquid securities and other forms of collateral.

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) approximately $59 million and $1,828 million of consumer loans during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline was mainly due to the reclassification of a larger mortgage portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023. Loans held by a business for sale are not included in the above since they have been reclassified to Other assets . See Note 2 for additional information regarding Citigroup's businesses held-for-sale.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
-----------------------------

The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi's U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available. With respect to Citi's consumer loan

portfolio outside of the U.S. as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($76.5 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of customers (see "Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America" below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.

| FICO score distribution - U.S. portfolio | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 |

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios-U.S. Consumer Mortgages
--------------------------------------------------

LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are calculated at

origination and updated by applying market price data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for Citi's U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for substantially all of the portfolio, applied at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral and ultimately maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi's significant consumer modification programs are described below.

Credit Cards
------------

Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers' entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi's standard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.

Residential Mortgages
---------------------

Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower's formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, $11 million and $25 million of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs, respectively. Mortgage loans of $2 million and $1 million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

1Q24 Changes in the ACL
-----------------------

The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments as of March 31, 2024 was $19,925 million, an increase from $19,873 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACLL was primarily driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both card portfolios and changes in macroeconomic assumptions impacting loan spread products, as well as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers, partially offset by lower card balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services and a change in ACL associated with the margin lending portfolio.

Consumer ACLL
-------------

Citi's total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) as of March 31, 2024 was $15,524 million, an increase from $15,431 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both card portfolios, as well as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers, partially offset by lower U.S. card volumes.

Corporate ACLL
--------------

Citi's total corporate ACLL as of March 31, 2024 was $2,772 million, an increase from $2,714 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by changes in macroeconomic assumptions impacting loans in spread products, partially offset by changes in portfolio composition in Banking .

ACLUC
-----

As of March 31, 2024, Citi's total ACLUC, included in Other liabilities , was $1,629 million, a decrease from $1,728 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a release related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries.

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of March 31, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi's goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

While the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as management executes on its transformation and strategy. If management's future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.

* · certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 22 for more information on these positions);
* · certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and
* · VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company's funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company's investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, crosscurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

Credit Card Securitizations
---------------------------

The Company's primary credit card securitization activity is throughtwo trusts -Citibank Credit Card Master Trust and Citibank Omni Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities given Citi's continuing involvement. For additional information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K. There were no material cash flows arising from either proceeds from new securitizations or paydowns of maturing notes during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Mortgage Securitizations

Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were $36.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
--------------------------------

The fair value of Citi's capitalized MSRs was $702 million and $658 million at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $52 billion and $50 billion as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Balance, beginning of period | $ 691 | $ 665 |
| Originations | 17 | 12 |
| Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions | 12 | (3) |
| Other changes (1) | (18) | (16) |
| Balance, as of March 31 | $ 702 | $ 658 |

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets .

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Servicing fees | $ 32 | 33 |
| Late fees | - | 1 |
| Total MSR fees | $ 32 | 34 |

In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as Commissions and fees , and changes in MSR fair values are classified as Other revenue .

Re-securitizations
------------------

The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi heldno retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $4.4 billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $5.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $1.8 billion (including $732 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024), compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 (including $930 million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately $69 billion and $84.1 billion, respectively.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits
--------------------------------------------------------

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $19.1 billion and $21.1 billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $17.8 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At March 31, 2024 and

December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 71 and 68 days, respectively.

Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi's internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit's assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $8.0 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company's investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
----------------------------------------------------

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.

The Company provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Asset-Based Financing
---------------------

The primary types of Citi's asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi's maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

| | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

1. DERIVATIVES

---

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi's use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10K.

Information pertaining to Citigroup's derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi's exposure to derivative transactions. Citi's derivative exposure arises primarily from

market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi's market share, levels of client activity and other factors.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company's derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.

In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the Company's balance sheet presentation, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 for further information.

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are presented below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains (losses) on the economically hedged items:

Cumulative Basis Adjustment
---------------------------

Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi's hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.

| Long-term debt | | 141,449 | (908) | (5,160) |

Cash Flow Hedges
----------------

Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.

For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | | 2023 |
| Amount of gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on derivatives | | | |
| Interest rate contracts | $ | 306 $ | 21 |
| Foreign exchange contracts | | 1 | (12) |
| Total gain (loss) recognized in AOCI | $ | 307 $ | 9 |

| | Other revenue | Net interest income | Other revenue | Net interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings (1) | | | | |
| Interest rate contracts | $ - | $ (342) $ | - | $ (469) |
| Foreign exchange contracts | (1) | - | (1) | - |
| Total gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings | $ (1) | $ (342) $ | (1) | $ (469) |
| Net pretax change in cash flow hedges included within AOCI | $ | 650 | | $ 479 |

The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of March 31, 2024 is approximately $(0.6) billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 14 years.

The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is presented in Note 19.

Net Investment Hedges
---------------------

Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup's equity investments in several nonU.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign

subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI . The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $192 million and $(676) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
------------------------------------------------------

Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $13 billion and $15 billion, respectively. The Company posted $11 billion and $12 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of March 31, 2024, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.5 billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $34 million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.6 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
----------------------------------------------------

For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $5.1 billion and $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

At March 31, 2024, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $4.9 billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of March 31, 2024 was $104 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $40 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $4.3 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $121 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $29 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

1. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

---

For additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Fair Value Hierarchy
--------------------

ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

* · Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
* · Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable in the market.
* · Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable .

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible.

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data-driven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:

* · The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based on the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date.
* · A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.
* · Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

Market Valuation Adjustments
----------------------------

The table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

| | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) | Credit and funding valuation adjustments contra-liability (contra-asset) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| Counterparty CVA | $ (486) $ | (580) |
| Asset FVA | (463) | (562) |
| Citigroup (own credit) CVA | 327 | 381 |
| Liability FVA | 199 | 255 |
| Total CVA and FVA-derivative instruments | $ (423) $ | (506) |

The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in CVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges, FVA on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi's own fair value option (FVO) liabilities for the periods indicated:

| | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) Three Months Ended March 31, | Credit/funding/debt valuation adjustments gain (loss) Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Counterparty CVA | $ 8 $ | (34) |
| Asset FVA | 84 | (6) |
| Own credit CVA | (52) | (35) |
| Liability FVA | (57) | (28) |
| Total CVA and FVA-derivative instruments | $ (17) $ | (103) |
| DVA related to own FVO liabilities (1) | $ (750) $ | (433) |
| Total CVA, DVA and FVA | $ (767) $ | (536) |

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
-------------------------------------------------

The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company may hedge positions

that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables:

Level 3 Fair Value Transfers
----------------------------

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024:

* · Transfers of Long-term debt were $1.4 billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $1.4 billion transfer, approximately $0.9 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.4 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $0.8 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023:

* · Transfers of Long-term debt were $1.1 billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $1.1 billion transfer, approximately $1.0 billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.1 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $4.8 billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.

Differences between this table and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
----------------------------------------------------

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.

The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:

| In millions of dollars | Fair value | Level 2 | Level 3 |

| Other financial liabilities (6) | 132.8 | 132.8 | - | 29.2 | 103.6 |

The estimated fair values of the Company's corporate unfunded lending commitments at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $12.9 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

1. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

---

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election

may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI .

The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 for additional details on Citi's MSRs.

Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 23.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

| | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) Three Months Ended March 31, | Changes in fair value-gains (losses) Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | 2024 | 2023 |
| Assets | | |
| Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell | $ (53) $ | 85 |
| Trading account assets | 7 | 61 |
| Loans | | |

| Certain mortgage loans HFS (1) | 1 | 8 |
| Total other assets | $ 13 $ | 5 |
| Total assets | $ 1,177 $ | (153) |
| Liabilities | | |
| Interest-bearing deposits | $ (42) $ | (134) |
| Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase | 36 | (68) |
| Trading account liabilities | (71) | 75 |
| Short-term borrowings (2) | (302) | (142) |
| Long-term debt (2) | (1,928) | (4,349) |
| Total liabilities | $ (2,307) $ | (4,618) |

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
------------------------------------

Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi's credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19 for additional information.

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company's credit spreads.

The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company's own credit spread (or instrumentspecific credit risk) were a loss of $(750) million and $(433) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company's current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
---------------------------------------

Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup's lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.

The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:

| | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In millions of dollars | Trading assets | Loans | Trading assets | Loans |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | $ 4,452 | 8,854 | 4,518 | $ 7,594 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | 26 | (13) | 88 | 10 |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | - | - | 1 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | - | 1 | - | 1 |

In addition to the amounts reported above, $375 million and $391 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi's Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $(16) million and a gain of $9 million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrumentspecific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
--------------------------------------------------

Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi's receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
------------------------------------------

Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.

The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:

| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | 467 $ | 571 |
| Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance | 6 | 17 |
| Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | 2 | 3 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due | | |
| | 1 | - |

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Certain Debt Liabilities
------------------------

The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt or Short-term borrowings on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of risk:

| In billions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest rate linked | $ 60.6 $ | 60.4 |
| Equity linked | 44.8 | 45.9 |
| Commodity linked | 4.6 | 5.3 |
| Credit linked | 5.3 | 4.7 |
| Total | $ 115.3 $ | 116.3 |

The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions . Changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions .

The following table provides information about long-term debt carried at fair value:

| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet | 115,317 $ | 116,338 |
| Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value | (2,719) | (2,842) |

The following table provides information about short-term borrowings carried at fair value:

Loans Sold with Recourse
------------------------

In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $11 million and $11 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing
-------------------------------------------------

Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $17.1 billion and $17.8 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Carrying Value-Guarantees and Indemnifications
----------------------------------------------

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities .

Performance Risk
----------------

Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.

| | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments | Maximum potential amount of future payments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Collateral
----------

Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $55.1 billion and $52.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $74.3 billion and $67.7 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.

Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit
--------------------------------------

The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.

The table below summarizes Citigroup's credit commitments:

| In millions of dollars | U.S. | Outside of U.S. (1) | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial and similar letters of credit | $ 691 | $ 4,038 | 4,729 $ | 5,345 |
| One- to four-family residential mortgages | 859 | 726 | 1,585 | 1,245 |
| Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties | 5,415 | 23 | 5,438 | 5,495 |
| Commercial real estate, construction and land development | 13,524 | 1,392 | 14,916 | 15,266 |
| Credit card lines | 618,246 | 65,104 | 683,350 | 677,005 |
| Commercial and other consumer loan commitments | 212,591 | 104,467 | 317,058 | 312,300 |
| Other commitments and contingencies (2) | 4,918 | 223 | 5,141 | 5,146 |
| Total | $ 856,244 | $ 175,973 | 1,032,217 $ | 1,021,802 |

Other Commitments
-----------------

As a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $4.5 billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.

In the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi had approximately $178.1 billion and $120.9 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $165.3 billion and $96.4 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 11 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company's policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

These amounts are not included in the table above.

Restricted Cash
---------------

Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers' primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority.

Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:

| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cash and due from banks | $ 3,494 | $ 3,479 |
| Deposits with banks, net of allowance | 15,644 | 15,538 |
| Total | $ 19,138 | $ 19,017 |

In addition to the restricted cash amounts presented above, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, was held at the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) and was subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. These restricted amounts are reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

1. LEASES

---

The Company's operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of March 31, 2024.

For additional information regarding Citi's leases, see Notes 1 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities , respectively:

| In millions of dollars | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ROU asset | $ 2,827 | 2,801 |
| Lease liability | 2,992 | 2,974 |

The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

At March 31, 2024, the Company had a future lease commitment scheduled to commence in April 2025 with fixed lease payments (undiscounted) totaling approximately $255 million over a 15-year lease term.

1. CONTINGENCIES

---

The following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosure in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.

In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.

If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At March 31, 2024, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.2 billion in the aggregate.

As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.

Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup's management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a

material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup's accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi's 2023 Form 10-K.

Government and regulatory agencies in the U.K. and Europe are conducting investigations or making inquiries regarding an equity desk trading error that occurred on May 2, 2022. Citigroup is cooperating with these investigations and inquiries.

FDIC Special Assessment
-----------------------

On November 29, 2023, the FDIC published a final rule implementing a special assessment to recover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, estimated to be approximately $16.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2024, Citi received notification from the FDIC that the estimate increased to $20.4 billion, which may be further adjusted by subsequent recoveries. The FDIC plans to provide institutions subject to the special assessment with an updated estimate of each institution's quarterly and total special assessment expense with its first-quarter 2024 special assessment invoice. In the first quarter of 2024, Citi increased its total accrued estimated liability to $2.0 billion within Other liabilities and reported the corresponding incremental expense of $251 million in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income (and within Corporate/Other in All Other ) for the special assessment.

1. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES

---

Citigroup Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities

to the extent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.'s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 18). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.

Summarized financial information for Citigroup Inc. and CGMHI is presented in the tables below:

GAAP measures on taxable equivalent basis, including the metrics derived from these measures, are non-GAAP financial measures.

TDR: Troubled debt restructuring. Prior to January 1, 2023, a TDR was deemed to occur when the Company modified the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions were not TDRs. The accounting guidance for TDRs was eliminated with the adoption of ASU 202202. See Note 1.
