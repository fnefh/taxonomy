      2021, compared to net income of $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the

      partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. Citigroup's
      effective tax rate was 20%, up modestly from 19% in the prior year.
      Earnings per share increased significantly, primarily driven by net

          2020 to $22.0 billion ($10.14 per share) in 2021, driven by lower cost
          of credit, though partially offset by higher expenses and lower
          revenues.

      ICG net income of $15.7 billion increased 36%, reflecting lower cost of
      credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. ICG
      operating expenses increased 8% to $26.5 billion, reflecting continued
      investments in Citi's transformation, business-led investments and
      revenue- and transaction-related expenses, partially offset by
      productivity savings. ICG revenues of $43.9 billion decreased 3%, as a 7%
      increase in Banking revenues was more than offset by an 11% decline in
      Markets and securities services revenues.

      - question: How did the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) perform in 2021?

      - question: What drove the changes in ICG's revenues?
        answer: ICG's revenue decline of 3% was due to an 11% decline in Markets and
          securities services revenues, which more than offset a 7% increase in
          Banking revenues.
      - question: How did ICG manage its operating expenses during this period?
        answer: ICG managed operating expenses through a balanced approach of investment
          and efficiency, with expenses increasing 8% to $26.5 billion due to

      GCB net income was $6.1 billion in 2021, compared to net income of $667
      million in the prior year, reflecting lower cost of credit, partially
      offset by lower revenues and higher expenses. GCB operating expenses of
      $20.0 billion increased 12%. Excluding the impact of FX translation and
      the Asia divestitures, expenses increased 5%, reflecting continued
      investments in Citi's transformation, as well as business-led investments
      and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How did the Global Consumer Banking (GCB) segment perform in 2021?
        answer: GCB's net income increased significantly to $6.1 billion in 2021 from
          $667 million in 2020, driven by lower cost of credit, though offset by
          lower revenues and higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 12%
          to $20.0 billion, or 5% excluding FX impact and Asia divestitures.
      - question: What factors contributed to GCB's expense growth?
        answer: GCB's operating expenses increased due to continued investments in
          Citi's transformation, business-led investments, and volume-related
          expenses, though partially offset by productivity savings. Excluding
          FX translation and Asia divestitures, the increase was 5%.
      - question: How did GCB's revenue performance impact its overall results?
        answer: GCB's revenue performance was challenged during the period, with lower
          revenues partially offsetting the benefits of reduced credit costs.
          This revenue pressure, combined with higher expenses, influenced the
          segment's overall profitability despite the significant improvement in
          net income.

      repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021. Citi returned approximately
      $11.8 billion of capital to its common shareholders in the form of $4.2
      billion in dividends and $7.6 billion in common share repurchases.

          end of 2021 from 11.5% at the end of 2020, primarily due to actions to
          reduce risk-weighted assets and a temporary pause in share repurchases
