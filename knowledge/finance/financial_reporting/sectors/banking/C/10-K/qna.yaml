      ICG net income of $15.7 billion increased 36%, reflecting lower cost of
      credit, partially offset by higher expenses and lower revenues. ICG
      operating expenses increased 8% to $26.5 billion, reflecting continued
      investments in Citi's transformation, business-led investments and
      revenue- and transaction-related expenses, partially offset by
      productivity savings. ICG revenues of $43.9 billion decreased 3%, as a 7%
      increase in Banking revenues was more than offset by an 11% decline in
      Markets and securities services revenues.

      - question: How did the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) perform in 2021?
        answer: ICG's net income increased 36% to $15.7 billion in 2021, driven by lower

          investments, while revenues declined 3% to $43.9 billion.
      - question: What drove the changes in ICG's revenues?
        answer: ICG's revenue decline of 3% was due to an 11% decline in Markets and

      Citigroup's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 12.2% as of December
      31, 2021, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for
      determining risk-weighted assets, compared to 11.5% as of December 31,
      2020. The increase in the ratio primarily reflected actions to reduce
      risk-weighted assets (RWA) and a temporary pause in common share
      repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021. Citi returned approximately
      $11.8 billion of capital to its common shareholders in the form of $4.2
      billion in dividends and $7.6 billion in common share repurchases.

      - question: How did Citigroup's capital position change in 2021?

          end of 2021 from 11.5% at the end of 2020, primarily due to actions to
          reduce risk-weighted assets and a temporary pause in share repurchases
          in Q4 2021.
      - question: How much capital did Citigroup return to shareholders in 2021?
