PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our 2023 Form 10-K. The discussion below contains forward-
looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ
materially from these expectations. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
Introduction and Business Overview
We are a premier consumer financial services company delivering one of the industry's most complete, digitally-enabled product suites. Our experience,
expertise and scale encompass a broad spectrum of industries including digital, health and wellness, retail, telecommunications, home, auto, outdoor, pet
and more. We have an established and diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry
associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our "partners." For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we financed $46.8
billion and $89.2 billion of purchase volume, respectively, and had 71.0 million and 71.4 million average active accounts, respectively, and at June 30,
2024, we had $102.3 billion of loan receivables.
We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail, affinity
relationships and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), including certificates
of deposit, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), money market accounts, savings accounts and sweep and affinity deposits. We also take deposits at
the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded
our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base has continued to serve as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for
our credit activities. At June 30, 2024, we had $83.1 billion in deposits, which represented 84% of our total funding sources.
Our Sales Platforms
We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, credit losses and operating expenses,
are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our revenue activities are within the United States. We primarily manage our credit products
through five sales platforms (Home & Auto, Digital, Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle). Those platforms are organized by the types of
partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics.

Credit Cards
We offer the following principal types of credit cards:

*   **Private Label Credit Cards.** Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe's or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. Credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended either on standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer.
*   **Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Branded Cards.** Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms and credit is typically extended on standard terms only. We offer either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards through over 15 of our large partners, of which the majority are Dual Cards, as well as our CareCredit Dual Card. Consumer Dual Cards and Co-Branded cards totaled 26% of our total loan receivables portfolio at June 30, 2024.

Commercial Credit Products
We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers.

Installment Loans
We originate secured installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily for power products in our Outdoor market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). We also offer unsecured installment loans primarily in our Home and Auto and Health and Wellness sales platforms and through our various other installment products, such as our Synchrony Pay Later solutions, including pay monthly and pay in 4 products, for short-term loans. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are generally assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. Installment loans at June 30, 2024 include loan receivables related to Ally Financial Inc.'s point of sale financing business, ("Ally Lending") that was acquired in March 2024.

# Business Trends and Conditions
We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions. For a discussion of certain trends and
conditions, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Trends and Conditions" in our 2023
Form 10-K. For a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, see "—Results of Operations."
## CFPB final rule on credit card late fees.
On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe
harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior $30 (adjusted to $41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to $8
and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule, when effective, will result in a significant
reduction in our interest and fees on loan receivables. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and the ultimate outcome of such
challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024; however, on May 10, 2024, the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect.
In response to the final rule, we have begun to implement a number of product, policy and pricing changes to adjust for the significant reduction in our late
fee income. In addition, the combined net effects of the final rule and our mitigating strategies would result in a decrease in payments to partners pursuant
to our retailer share arrangements.
While we continue to believe that the strategies we have identified and started to implement will fully offset the decline in late fee income over time, it will
take time for such product, policy and pricing changes to offset the reduction in the late fees. Therefore we expect the final rule, if effective in 2024, will
have an adverse effect on our results of operations in 2024. The magnitude of these effects in 2024 remain uncertain due to the pending litigation
discussed above, which has resulted in a delay in the final rule's effective date. In addition, the effects of the final rule are also subject to other factors that
could increase the adverse effects to our results of operations, including our ability to successfully implement the product, policy and pricing changes we
have identified, as well as any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to these changes or the final rule itself.
For a discussion of risks related to a CFPB final late fee rule, please see "—Risk Factors Relating to our Business—The CFPB's proposed rule on credit
card late fees, if adopted, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations", in our 2023 Form 10-K.
## Growth in loan receivables and interest income.
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in purchase volume of 0.9% primarily driven by lower consumer spending and
the impacts from credit actions we have taken across our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default. We expect these same
factors to now result in flat or a low single digit decrease in purchase volume for the second half of 2024. As a result, while we still anticipate loan
receivables to increase for the remainder of 2024, we expect the rate of growth to moderate.
All of the factors discussed above and in our 2023 Form 10-K, such as customer payment behavior and the CFPB final rule on credit card late fees, will
continue to have an effect on our loan receivables and interest income. For additional discussion of those factors, please see "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Trends and Conditions—CFPB final rule on credit card late fees" and "—Growth
in loan receivables and interest income" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

# Page 11 of 69

# Seasonality
We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment
patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables typically
occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.
The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency
metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods.
In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and
delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates, resulting in higher net
charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the
subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status, resulting in lower net charge-off
rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of
returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher
proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year
end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at
the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past
due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these
same seasonal trends.
However, in addition to these seasonal trends, the elevated customer payment behavior we have experienced in recent years and more recently the
subsequent moderation from these elevated levels, has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics and the fluctuations experienced between
quarterly periods. The effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted in either partial, or in some instances full, offset to the
impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above.

## Results of Operations

### Highlights for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024

Below are highlights of our performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.

*   Net earnings increased to $643 million from $569 million and to $1.9 billion from $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher net interest income and lower retailer share arrangements, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the after-tax gain on sale related to Pets Best of $802 million, as well as the same trends experienced in the three months ended June 30, 2024.

*   Loan receivables increased 7.9% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $94.8 billion at June 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition.

*   Net interest income increased 6.9% to $4.4 billion and 7.8% to $8.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Interest and fees on loans increased 10.2% and 12.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense increased 30.6% and 43.0%, respectively, due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities.

*   Retailer share arrangements decreased 8.7% to $810 million and 12.7% to $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.

*   Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased 63 basis points to 4.47% at June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023. The net charge-off rate increased 167 basis points to 6.42% and increased 175 basis points to 6.37% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

*   Provision for credit losses increased by $308 million, or 22.3%, and $902 million, or 33.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by lower reserve builds. The reserve build in the six months ended June 30, 2024 included $180 million related to the Ally Lending acquisition. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loan receivables) increased to 10.74% at June 30, 2024, as compared to 10.34% at June 30, 2023.

*   Other income increased by $56 million to $117 million, and by $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a gain of $51 million related to an exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock as well as the initial impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees, partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best disposition. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition.

*   Other expense increased by $8 million, or 0.7%, and $95 million, or 4.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change and servicing costs related to the newly acquired business, partially offset by lower operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by these same factors, other than employee costs which increased primarily attributable to an increase in headcount driven by growth.

*   At June 30, 2024, deposits represented 84% of our total funding sources. Total deposits increased by 2.4% to $83.1 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.

**Interest Income**

Interest income increased by $561 million, or 11.2%, and $1.3 billion, or 13.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily
driven by increases in interest and fees on loans of 10.2% and 12.4%, respectively. The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 in
interest and fees on loans were primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower customer payment rates and higher benchmark rates.

Average loan receivables, including held for sale, increased 9.7% and 10.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily
driven by lower customer payment rates. Purchase volume decreased by 0.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 reflecting lower consumer
spend as well as the impact of credit actions. Purchase volume increased 0.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 reflecting growth in average
active accounts and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by lower consumer spend and the impact of credit actions.

**Yield on average interest-earning assets**

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in the yield on
average loan receivables. The increases in loan receivable yield were 14 basis points to 21.01% and 31 basis points to 21.05% for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

**Interest Expense**

Interest expense increased by $276 million to $1.2 billion, and $704 million to $2.3 billion, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively,
due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 4.80% and 4.77% for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.04% and 3.74% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

<h2>Net Interest Income</h2>

<h2>Retailer Share Arrangements</h2>
```

Retailer share arrangements decreased by $77 million, or 8.7%, and $230 million, or 12.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Other income increased by $56 million to $117 million, and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we participated in the Visa exchange offer, which included the exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock for Visa Class C common stock, which was recorded at fair value. The increase in other income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven primarily by a gain of $51 million related to the exchange of Visa Class B-1 common stock and the initial impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees, partially offset by lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition.

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition. The pre-tax gain amount of $1.1 billion is included within the Other component of Other Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

## Other Expense

| ($ in millions) | Three months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, |
|---|---|---|
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Employee costs | $ 434 | $ 451 | $ 930 | $ 902 |
| Professional fees | 236 | 209 | 456 | 395 |
| Marketing and business development | 129 | 133 | 254 | 264 |
| Information processing | 207 | 179 | 393 | 345 |
| Other | 171 | 197 | 350 | 382 |
| **Total other expense** | $ 1,177 | $ 1,169 | $ 2,383 | $ 2,288 |

Other expense increased by $8 million, or 0.7% and by $95 million, or 4.2%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

The increase in the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change and servicing costs related to the newly acquired business, partially offset by lower operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs.

The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the same factors for the three months ended June 30, 2024, other than employee costs, which increased for the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily attributable to an increase in headcount driven by growth.

## Provision for Income Taxes

| ($ in millions) | Three months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, |
|---|---|---|
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Effective tax rate | 23.8 % | 23.3 % | 24.1 % | 23.6 % |
| Provision for income taxes | $ 201 | $ 173 | $ 616 | $ 362 |

The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of research and development credits recorded in the same period in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in state tax expense in the current period related to the Pets Best disposition. For both periods presented, the effective tax rate differs from the applicable U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “—Our Sales Platforms,” we offer our credit products primarily through five sales platforms (Home & Auto, Digital, Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle), which measure management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, for each of our five sales platforms and Corp, Other.

Home & Auto

| ($ in millions) | Three months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, |
|---|---|---|
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Purchase volume | $ 12,496 | $ 12,853 | $ 23,008 | $ 23,716 |
| Period-end loan receivables | $ 32,822 | $ 30,926 | $ 32,822 | $ 30,926 |
| Average loan receivables, including held for sale | $ 32,592 | $ 30,210 | $ 32,228 | $ 29,951 |
| Average active accounts (in thousands) | 19,335 | 18,935 | 19,176 | 18,769 |
| Interest and fees on loans | $ 1,419 | $ 1,275 | $ 2,801 | $ 2,500 |
| Other income | $ 38 | $ 27 | $ 71 | $ 52 |

Home & Auto interest and fees on loans increased by $144 million, or 11.3%, and increased by $301 million, or 12.0%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. The increase in average loan receivables for both periods primarily reflects the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition as well as the impact of lower consumer payment rates. Purchase volume decreased 2.8% and 3.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as growth in Home Specialty and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition were more than offset by a combination of lower consumer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and the impact of credit actions.

Digital

|---|---|---|
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |

| Interest and fees on loans | $ 1,544 | $ 1,422 | $ 3,111 | $ 2,785 |
| Other income | $ — | $ (2) | $ 6 | $ (1) |

Digital interest and fees on loans increased by $122 million, or 8.6%, and $326 million, or 11.7%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates. Purchase volume decreased by 0.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting continued customer engagement through growth in average active accounts. Purchase volume increased by 1.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting continued customer engagement through growth in average active accounts. Average active accounts increased 1.8% and 2.8%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

Diversified & Value interest and fees on loans increased by $74 million, or 6.8%, and $218 million, or 10.1%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates.

Purchase volume increased by 1.9%, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, reflecting growth in both in-partner and out-of-partner spend, partially offset by the impact of credit actions.

## Loan Receivables

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenue. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our loan receivables.

The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated.

</table>

Loan receivables decreased 0.7% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $103.0 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the seasonality of our business, partially offset by the Ally Lending acquisition and lower customer payment rates. Loan receivables related to the Ally Lending acquisition are included within Consumer installment loans at June 30, 2024 in the table above.

Loan receivables increased 7.9% to $102.3 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $94.8 billion at June 30, 2023 driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition.

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at June 30, 2024.

### Delinquencies

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.47% at June 30, 2024 from 3.84% at June 30, 2023, and decreased from 4.74% at December 31, 2023. The increase compared to June 30, 2023, was primarily driven by lower customer payment rates. The decrease in delinquency rate during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the seasonality of our business.

### Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in Other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

**Allowance for Credit Losses**

The allowance for credit losses totaled $11.0 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023, respectively, and $9.8 billion at June 30, 2023, and reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 10.74% at June 30, 2024, from 10.26% at December 31, 2023 and increased from 10.34% at June 30, 2023.

The increase in allowance for credit losses compared to December 31, 2023 includes the addition of the Ally Lending portfolio. See Note 5. *Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses* to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1) Excludes $393 million and $415 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-
interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.
Deposits
We obtain deposits directly from retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers ("direct deposits") or through third-party brokerage firms that offer
our deposits to their customers ("brokered deposits"). At June 30, 2024, we had $70.8 billion in direct deposits and $12.3 billion in deposits originated
through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key
part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low-cost funding.
Our direct deposits are primarily from retail customers and include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAS,
money market accounts, savings accounts, sweep and affinity deposits.
Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their
networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate. These deposits generally are not subject to
early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

## Securitized Financings

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”).

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at June 30, 2024.

<br>

| ($ in millions) | Less Than One Year | One Year Through Three Years | Four Years Through Five Years | After Five Years | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings—owed to securitization investors: |  |  |  |  |  |
| SYNCT | $ 800 | $ 1,100 | $ - | $ - | $ 1,900 |
| SFT | 475 | 975 | - | - | 1,450 |
| SYNIT<sup>(1)</sup> | 1,000 | 3,175 | - | - | 4,175 |
| **Total long-term borrowings—owed to securitization investors** | $ 2,275 | $ 5,250 | $ - | $ - | $ 7,525 |

<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNIT notes that we owned at June 30, 2024.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below a specified level. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust’s asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT.

## Covenants

The indentures pursuant to which our senior and subordinated unsecured notes have been issued include various covenants. If we do not satisfy any of these covenants, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at June 30, 2024.

At June 30, 2024, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

## Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks:

<table border="1">

      <td>Stable</td>
      <td>Positive</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody's. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

## Liquidity

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at June 30, 2024 had $20.0 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $16.8 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2023. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the seasonality of our business, deposit growth and the proceeds from the Pets Best disposition, as well as issuances of secured notes and preferred stock. We believe our liquidity position at June 30, 2024 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change.

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.

We also have access to several additional sources of liquidity beyond our liquidity portfolio. At June 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of $10.2 billion of available borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve's discount window, $2.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, and $0.8 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders. In addition, we have other unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged for credit at the discount window.

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness, see "Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock" and "Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Capital

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.

Beginning in 2024, we are now subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements and have submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board.

In February 2024, we issued depositary shares representing $500 million of Series B 8.250% fixed rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock,
with dividends payable quarterly beginning in May 2024. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock
will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors. For a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends
and repurchase stock, see "Regulation-Risk Factors Relating to Regulation-We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and
repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends,
repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased $600 million of common stock as part of our 2023 share repurchase program. In April 2024,
the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion through June 30, 2025 (the "2024 plan"). At June 30,
2024, all of the authorization capacity under the 2024 plan remained outstanding. Repurchases under this program are subject to market conditions and
other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more
information, see "Regulation-Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial
must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet
and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At June 30, 2024, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-
capitalized.

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at June 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Basel III

| ($ in millions) |  | At June 30, 2024 |  |  | At December 31, 2023 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Amount | Ratio (1) |  | Amount | Ratio(1) |
| Total risk-based capital | $ | 16,438 | 15.8% | $ | 15,464 | 14.9% |
| Tier 1 risk-based capital | $ | 14,290 | 13.8% | $ | 13,334 | 12.9% |
| Tier 1 leverage | $ | 14,290 | 12.0% | $ | 13,334 | 11.7% |
| Common equity Tier 1 capital | $ | 13,068 | 12.6% | $ | 12,600 | 12.2% |
| Risk-weighted assets | $ | 103,718 |  | $ | 103,460 |  |

(1) Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent
the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.

The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the
effects of CECL on our regulatory capital. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the effects are being phased-in over a three-year transitional period
through 2024, collectively the "CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment". The effects of CECL on our regulatory capital will be fully phased-in
beginning in the first quarter of 2025. For more information, see "Capital-Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial" in our 2023 Form 10-
Κ.

Capital amounts and ratios in the above table all reflect the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. The increase in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the retention of net earnings during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the net impact of the Pets Best disposition and Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by the third year phase-in of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital.

### Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and also reflects the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period:

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us” in our 2023 Form 10-K.

### Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At June 30, 2024, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 6 – Variable Interest Entities to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment commitments for unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIE’s”).

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 5 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.

In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2023 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates.

## Regulation and Supervision

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance.

As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior $30 (adjusted to $41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to $8 and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect. The final outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. See “Business Trends and Conditions” above for the anticipated financial impacts related to the final rule.

On June 20, 2024, the FDIC released a final rule imposing additional requirements for the content of resolution plans submitted by insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank, following the rule’s effective date of October 1, 2024. Under the final rule, if the FDIC deems a resolution plan filing not credible, the institution could become subject to an enforcement action. Our first resolution plan under the final rule is due on July 1, 2025 and we will be required to file a resolution plan once every three years thereafter. Additionally, we will be required to submit interim supplements annually. We are evaluating the impact of the final rule.

See “Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business” in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on regulations that apply to us, and “—Capital” above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock.

Synchrony Financial and subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
NOTE 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Synchrony Financial (the "Company") provides a range of credit products through financing programs it has established with a diverse group of national
and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers. We primarily offer private
label, Dual Card, co-brand and general purpose credit cards, as well as short- and long-term installment loans, and savings products insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") through Synchrony Bank (the "Bank").
References to the "Company", "we", "us" and "our" are to Synchrony Financial and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.
NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").
Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates,
future, economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, housing, interest rates and market liquidity) which affect reported amounts and
related disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we
expect them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates,
which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Among other effects, such changes could result in incremental losses on loan
receivables, future impairments of debt securities, goodwill and intangible assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation
allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities.
We primarily conduct our business within the United States and substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers. The operating activities
conducted by our non-U.S. affiliates use the local currency as their functional currency. The effects of translating the financial statements of these non-
U.S. affiliates to U.S. dollars are included in equity. Asset and liability accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses
are translated at average rates for the respective periods.
Consolidated Basis of Presentation
The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate
all of our subsidiaries - i.e., entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest. To determine if
we hold a controlling financial interest in an entity, we first evaluate if we are required to apply the variable interest entity ("VIE") model to the entity,
otherwise the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. We consolidate certain securitization entities under the VIE model. See Note 6. Variable
Interest Entities.
Interim Period Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited. These statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) that we considered necessary to present a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The results
reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be considered as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the
entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2023 annual consolidated financial statements and
the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "2023 Form 10-K").

## New Accounting Standards

Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements and requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance on a retrospective basis on its effective date, which for us is beginning within our December 31, 2024 Form 10-K.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, and additional disaggregated information about income taxes paid. The Company will adopt this guidance on its effective date, which for us is beginning within our December 31, 2025 Form 10-K, and is currently determining the method of adoption.

### Equity Method Investments

We use the equity method of accounting for investments where we have significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our assessment of significant influence includes factors such as our ownership interest, legal form, and representation on the board of directors. The Company generally records the initial investment at cost or fair value, as appropriate. Subsequently, we adjust each investment for our proportionate share of net income or loss in the investee. We amortize, where appropriate, differences between the Company's cost basis and underlying equity in net assets, which are reported in Other Income. The Company evaluates equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.

See Note 2. *Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies* to our 2023 annual consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K, for additional information on our other significant accounting policies.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Ally Lending

On March 1, 2024, we acquired Ally Financial Inc.'s point of sale financing business, ("Ally Lending") for cash consideration of $ 2.0 billion. This acquisition deepens our presence and reach in the home improvement and health and wellness sectors, including high-growth specialty areas such as roofing, HVAC, and windows, as well as in cosmetic, audiology, and dentistry.

The Ally Lending acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (measurement period adjustments) were recognized related to the acquisition as detailed in the table below.

<table border="1">

(a) Loan discounts are recognized into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the acquired loans. The change to the provisional amount of loan discount recorded in the current period resulted in an increase in the amount of discount amortized into interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, including $9 million which relates to the previous quarter.

The amounts above represent the current provisional estimated fair values of the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The changes in the estimated fair values during the three months ended June 30, 2024 reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustments did not result from events occurring subsequent to the acquisition date.

The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete and will be finalized no later than one year after the acquisition date. The goodwill recognized related to the acquisition is tax-deductible and reflects the expected synergies and operational efficiencies arising from the transaction.

The acquisition primarily included loan receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $ 2.2 billion. These loan receivables are reported within Consumer installment loans in Note 5. *Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses*. To determine the provisional fair value of loans at acquisition, we estimate expected cash flows and discount those cash flows using an observable market rate of interest, which when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. In determining fair value, expected cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment, default rate, and loss severity estimates. The difference between the fair value and the amount contractually due is recorded as a loan discount or premium at acquisition, including the impact of measurement period adjustments, at June 30, 2024 the provisional loan discount at the acquisition date was $469 million, which is to be amortized into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as described within Note 2. *Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies* within our 2023 Form 10-K. The interest and fees related to the acquired business are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings subsequent to the acquisition date and totaled $113 million and $141 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts include amortization of the loan discount recognized at acquisition of $66 million and $80 million, respectively. Expense activities, including those associated with the acquired business, are managed for the Company as a whole.

Loans acquired without a more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are measured under the Allowance for Credit Losses model, as described within Note 2. *Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies* within our 2023 Form 10-K. The Company's best estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the date of acquisition was $180 million, which is included within our allowance for credit losses, and recognized through provision for credit losses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

Included in the acquisition was $64 million of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination (referred to as "purchased credit deteriorated" or "PCD" assets) that were not immediately written off at the acquisition date and are subject to specific guidance upon acquisition. An allowance for PCD assets of $39 million was recorded at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the accounting for the PCD assets will generally follow the Allowance for Credit Losses model described within Note 2. *Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies* of our 2023 Form 10-K.

***Pets Best***

In March 2024, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pets Best Insurance Services, LLC ("Pets Best") to Poodle Holdings, Inc. ("Buyer") for consideration comprising a combination of cash and an equity interest of less than 10% in Independence Pet Holdings, Inc. ("IPH") an affiliate of Buyer. In connection with the sale, IPH also appointed two Synchrony executives to its board of directors. The sale of Pets Best resulted in the recognition of a gain on sale of $1.1 billion or $802 million, net of tax in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The pre-tax gain amount has been recognized within the Other component of Other Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The Company's initial equity investment in IPH was recorded in Other Assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The investment was recorded at its estimated fair value at the date acquired of $605 million. The estimated fair value at acquisition date was determined using a weighted average methodology of three approaches: a market approach which includes using a multiple of projected revenues, precedent transactions and an intrinsic value analysis. The market-multiple approach was established based on a selected group of publicly traded companies. The use of selected precedent transaction multiples was calibrated to the valuation outcome using the market approach. Intrinsic value analysis determines implied multiples primarily based upon recent market studies and forecasted performance. The change in the carrying value of our equity investment in IPH subsequent to the date acquired was not material.

We regularly review debt securities for impairment resulting from credit loss using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, as necessary based on the
composition of the portfolio at period end. Based on our assessment, no material impairments for credit losses were recognized during the period.

We presently do not intend to sell our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be
required to sell these securities before recovery of our amortized cost.

(a) The allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2024 and 2023 reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at June 30, 2024 and 2023 which include the consideration of current and expected macroeconomic conditions that
existed at those dates.
(b) Excluded from the table above are allowance for credit losses for loan receivables acquired and immediately written off within the period presented.
(c) Provision for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 also includes amounts
associated with off-balance sheet credit exposures recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.
(d) Primarily represents allowance for credit losses for PCD assets.

The reasonable and supportable forecast period used in our estimate of credit losses at June 30, 2024 was 12 months, consistent with the forecast period
utilized since the adoption of CECL. Beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information at the loan
receivables segment level over a 6-month period, gradually increasing the weight of historical losses by an equal amount each month during the reversion
period, and utilize historical loss information thereafter for the remaining life of the portfolio. The reversion period and methodology remain unchanged
since the adoption of CECL.

Losses on loan receivables, including those which are modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance at June 30, 2024. Expected credit loss estimates are developed using both quantitative models and qualitative adjustments, and incorporates a macroeconomic forecast, as described within Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within our 2023 Form 10-K. The current and forecasted economic conditions at the balance sheet date influenced our current estimate of expected credit losses, which reflects our expectations of the macroeconomic environment. We continued to experience a decrease in payment rates and total delinquencies, which reflects our expectations of the receivables from the prior quarter. We also experienced an increase in net charge-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and expect net charge-offs as a percentage of loan receivables to reduce in the second half of 2024. These conditions are reflected in our current estimate of expected credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses increased to $11.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting these conditions and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our 2023 annual consolidated financial statements within our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our significant accounting policies related to our allowance for credit losses.

Credit Quality Indicators
Our loan receivables portfolio includes both secured and unsecured loans. Secured loan receivables are largely comprised of consumer installment loans
secured by equipment. Unsecured loan receivables are largely comprised of our open-ended consumer and commercial revolving credit card loans. As
part of our credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a
customer's account with us, including delinquency information, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer's broader credit
performance. We utilize VantageScore credit scores to assist in our assessment of credit quality. VantageScore credit scores are obtained at origination of
the account and are refreshed, at a minimum quarterly, but could be as often as weekly, to assist in predicting customer behavior. We categorize these
credit scores into the following three credit score categories: (i) 651 or higher, which are considered the strongest credits; (ii) 591 to 650, considered
moderate credit risk; and (iii) 590 or less, which are considered weaker credits. There are certain customer accounts, including for our commercial credit
products, for which a VantageScore credit score may not be available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit quality and predict behavior.
The following table provides the most recent VantageScore credit scores, or equivalent, available for our revolving credit card and commercial credit
product customers at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, as a percentage of each class of loan receivable. The table
below excludes 0.3%, 0.3% and 0.4% of our total loan receivables balance for our credit cards and commercial credit products at each of June 30, 2024,
December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, which represents those customer accounts for which a VantageScore credit score, or equivalent, is
not available.

## Financial Effects of Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty

As part of our loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability. For long-term modifications made in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the financial effect of these modifications reduced the weighted-average interest rates by 97% for both periods, respectively. For long-term modifications made in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the financial effect of these modifications reduced the weighted-average interest rates by 96% and 97%, respectively. For short-term modifications made in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, unpaid balances of $15 million and $114 million, respectively, were forgiven. For short-term modifications made in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, unpaid balances of $10 million and $67 million, respectively, were forgiven.

We manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of credit, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity of our portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit products. Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled approximately $431 billion and $427 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.

**Interest Income by Product**

The following table provides additional information about our interest and fees on loans, including merchant discounts, from our loan receivables, including held for sale:

($ in millions)
| | Three months ended June 30, | | Six months ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Other | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5 |
| Total(b) | $ 5,301 | $ 4,812 | $ 10,594 | $ 9,428 |

NOTE 6. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
We use VIEs to securitize loan receivables and arrange asset-backed financing in the ordinary course of business. Investors in these entities only have
recourse to the assets owned by the entity and not to our general credit. We do not have implicit support arrangements with any VIE and we did not
provide non-contractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any of these VIEs in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and
2023. Our VIEs are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new asset-backed financings, consistent with the requirements and limitations on
such activities placed on the VIE by existing investors. Once an account has been designated to a VIE, the contractual arrangements we have require all
existing and future loan receivables originated under such account to be transferred to the VIE. The amount of loan receivables held by our VIEs in excess
of the minimum amount required under the asset-backed financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under removal of accounts
provisions. All loan receivables held by a VIE are subject to claims of third-party investors.
In evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider the purpose
for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decision-making role, if any, in those activities that
significantly determine the entity's economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders. This evaluation requires consideration of all
facts and circumstances relevant to decision-making that affects the entity's future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding
which decision-making rights are most important.
In determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a VIE, we evaluate all
of our economic interests in the entity, regardless of form (debt, equity, management and servicing fees, and other contractual arrangements). This
evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entity's design, including: the entity's capital structure, contractual rights to earnings or losses,
subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors, as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the
potential to be economically significant. The evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic
interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment.
We consolidate VIEs where we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the VIEs' economic performance, typically because of our
role as either servicer or administrator for the VIEs. The power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the VIEs'
assets as well as directing certain affairs of the VIEs, including determining whether and on what terms debt of the VIEs will be issued.
The loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard.
Accordingly, the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables, and the blended performance of the pools of
receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer. Contractually, the cash
flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay third-party debt holders, as well as other expenses of the entity. Excess cash flows, if any,
are available to us. The creditors of these entities have no claim on our other assets.

We provide servicing for all of our consolidated VIEs. Collections are required to be placed into segregated accounts owned by each VIE in amounts that
meet contractually specified minimum levels. These segregated funds are invested in cash and cash equivalents and are restricted as to their use,
principally to pay maturing principal and interest on debt and the related servicing fees. Collections above these minimum levels are remitted to us on a
daily basis.
Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $ 1.0 billion and $1.0 billion for the three months ended June 30
2024 and 2023, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for credit losses of $257 million and $244 million for the three months
ended June 30 2024 and 2023, respectively, and interest expense of $110 million and $78 million for the three months ended June 30 2024 and 2023,
respectively.
Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $ 2.0 billion and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for credit losses of $422 million and $364 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and interest expense of $215 million and $ 155 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. These amounts do not include intercompany transactions, principally fees and interest, which are eliminated in our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
Non-consolidated VIES
As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in affordable housing properties and receive affordable housing tax credits for these
investments. These investments included in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position totaled $749 million and $736 million at
June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represents our total exposure for these entities.
For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized amortization expense of $ 24 million and $ 15 million, respectively, and tax credits and
other tax benefits of $28 million and $24 million, respectively, associated with investments in affordable housing properties within income tax expense or
benefit. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized amortization expense of $47 million and $35 million, respectively, and tax
credits and other tax benefits of $56 million and $47 million, respectively, associated with investments in affordable housing properties within income tax
expense or benefit.
Our other investments in non-consolidated VIEs, totaled $ 269 million and $252 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At June 30,
2024, the Company also had investment commitments of $215 million related to these investment S.

NOTE 11. REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY

As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal
Reserve Board and subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by Basel III capital rules and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and
examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the "OCC"), which is its primary regulator, and by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as
calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about
components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in
the tables below) of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital
to average assets (as defined).

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, the Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not
be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and
maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.

The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the
effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the effects are being phased-in over a three-year period through 2024 and
will be fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the
phase-in period included both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit
losses during the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, collectively the "CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment". Beginning in the first
quarter of 2024 only 25% of the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment is deferred in our regulatory capital amounts and ratios, as compared to
50% at December 31, 2023.

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Synchrony Financial met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to Federal
Reserve Board regulations. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank also met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized
pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no conditions or events subsequent to June 30, 2024 that
management believes have changed the Company's or the Bank's capital category.

NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities, which are calculated using the treasury stock method.

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:

We have issued certain stock-based awards under the Synchrony Financial 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan. A total of zero shares and 6 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1 million and 5 million shares for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to these awards, were considered anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share.

NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
($ in millions)
Unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penaltiesa)
Portion that, if recognized, would reduce tax expense and effective tax rateb)

|  | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $ | 242 | 230 |
| $ | 191 | 182 |

(a) Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were not material for all periods presented.
(b) Comprised of federal unrecognized tax benefits and state and local unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated U.S. federal income taxes. Excludes
amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets.
We establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) on an income tax return and the amount of
taxes recognized in our financial statements. The liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically when new information
becomes available. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to be resolved in the next twelve months is expected to be $39
million, of which $31 million, if recognized, would reduce the Company's tax expense and effective tax rate.
In the current year, the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the IRS to participate voluntarily in the IRS Compliance Assurance
Process ("CAP") program for the 2024 tax year, and thus the tax year is under IRS review. The IRS is also examining our 2023 tax year, and we expect
the review will be completed in the current year. Additionally, we are under examination in various states going back to 2014.
We believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further
believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations.
NOTE 15. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY MATTERS
In the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings, including arbitrations, class actions
and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or
punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings
(both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business (collectively, "regulatory matters"), which could subject us to significant fines,
penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our
reputation. We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance,
we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably
estimable.
Legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance, and we may be
exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued.
For some matters, we are able to determine that an estimated loss, while not probable, is reasonably possible. For other matters, including those that
have not yet progressed through discovery and/or where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved, we are unable to make such an
estimate. We currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters, whether in excess of a related accrued
liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss, are immaterial. This represents management's
estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimate of possible loss does not represent
our potential maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual
results may vary significantly from current estimates.

# Page 64 of 69

Our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to
be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented.
Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material
adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate
outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or
liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.

We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally either the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), U.S. Treasury bills, or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the SOFR, U.S. Treasury bills or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities.

The following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at June 30, 2024.

| Basis Point Change | At June 30, 2024 |
|---|---|
| -100 basis points | $(199) |
| +100 basis points | 31 |

For a more detailed discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to " Management's Discussion and Analysis—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), and based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024.

No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
