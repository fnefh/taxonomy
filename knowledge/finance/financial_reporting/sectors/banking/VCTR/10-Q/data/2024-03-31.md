Revenue

The Company's revenue includes fees earned from providing:

* investment management services,
* fund administration services,
* fund transfer agent services, and
* fund distribution services.

Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company's control including customer or underlying investor contributions

and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values
or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services.
Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based
on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service
provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by
another party and do not control the service.

Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of
investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and
consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally
paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.

AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the
valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds and certain other
pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the
commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a
successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost
basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make
portfolio investments that have been disposed.

Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or
quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to
another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change.

The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment
vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified
operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction
price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the
Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to
customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct
services are received in exchange for these payments.

Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the
transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of
investment performance on a client's account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the customer.
Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable
that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management
fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a
performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed
experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer's contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement
with certain equity and fixed income Victory Funds III is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified
benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month.

Fund Administration Fees

The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are
determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services
are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets and
constraints are removed. The Company's

fund administration fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

Fund Compliance Fees

The Company has an agreement to provide compliance design, administration and oversight services for the Victory Funds and the VictoryShares in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act. The Company furnishes a VCM employee to serve as the Chief Compliance Officer and provides other compliance personnel and resources reasonably necessary to perform the services under this agreement. The Company earns a fixed annual fee for these compliance services which is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fund Transfer Agent Fees

The Company recognizes fund transfer agent fees using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund transfer agent fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to either the average daily net assets of the Victory Funds III for which transfer agent services are provided or number of accounts in the Victory Funds III. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets or actual number of accounts and constraints are removed. The Company's fund transfer agent fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company also receives fees for sub-transfer agency services under contracts with the Victory Funds for member class shares. Sub-transfer agency fees are recognized and recorded in a manner similar to fund transfer agent fees and are recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. As the Company is the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the Victory Funds III and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

Fund Distribution Fees

The Company receives compensation for sales and sales-related services promised under distribution contracts with the Victory Funds. Revenue is measured in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing distribution services. Distribution fees are generally calculated as a percentage of average net assets in the Victory Funds. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the services is transferred to customers, which is upon investor subscription or redemption.

Based on the nature of the calculation, the revenue for these services is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company may recognize distribution fee revenue in the current period that pertains to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods as variable consideration is recognized only when uncertainties are resolved. The Company's distribution fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. The Company is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of the Company's revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties.

Included in fund distribution fees are transaction and account-level fees paid by VCS brokerage platform customers for trade execution, cash transfer and other services.

Costs Incurred to Obtain or Fulfill Customer Contracts

The Company is required to capitalize certain costs directly related to the acquisition or fulfillment of a contract with a customer. Victory has not identified any sales-based compensation or similar costs that meet the definition of an incremental cost to acquire a contract and as such we have no intangible assets related to contract acquisitions.

Direct costs incurred to fulfill services under the Company's distribution contracts include sales commissions paid to third party dealers for the sale of Class C Shares. The Company may pay upfront sales commissions to dealers and institutions that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commissions payments with

respect to Class C shares equal 1.00% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an
upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid
expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit.
Valuation of AUM and fund investments
The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent
third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.
In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the
sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company's other non-alternative
investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.
The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation
policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for
these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for
alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds' net asset values or the total fair value of the funds' portfolio investments as AUM
represents the basis for calculating management fees.
For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company's total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker
price quote or pricing service quotation.
NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS
USAA AMCO Acquisition
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made the fourth and final earn-out payment due to sellers under the terms of the USAA AMCO purchase
agreement.
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the increase in the USAA AMCO contingent consideration liability of $4.3 million was recorded in change in
value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
NEC Acquisition
Under the terms of the NEC purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional $35.0 million in cash based on NEC's net revenue growth
over a six-year period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the 36-month, 48-month and
60-month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the "Start Date") for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up
payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12-
month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments, less any contingent payments previously
paid, is due upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date.
The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for post-
closing services. The Company records compensation expense over the estimated service period in an amount equal to the total contingent payments
currently forecasted to be paid.
For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $1.0 million and $1.6 million in NEC contingent payment compensation
expense, respectively, which is included in personnel compensation and benefits in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The liability for NEC contingent payments totaled $14.6 million and $13.7 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is
included in accrued compensation and benefits in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
WestEnd Acquisition
Under the terms of the WestEnd purchase agreement, a maximum of $320.0 million ($80.0 million per year) of contingent payments is payable to sellers.
Contingent earn-out payments are based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during each of the first four years following the WestEnd Closing,
subject to certain "catch-up" provisions over a five and one-half year period following the WestEnd Closing.

NOTE 7. INVESTMENTS

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments. Investments in proprietary funds consist entirely of seed capital investments in certain Victory Funds. Deferred compensation plan investments are held under deferred compensation plans and include Victory Funds and third party mutual funds. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments are recorded in earnings as interest income and other income (expense).

NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 differs from the United States federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes, excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and certain non-deductible expenses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was $16.2 million and $12.6 million, or 22.5% and 20.4%, of pre-tax income respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was higher than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2023 due primarily to changes in the levels of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and non-deductible expenses.

No valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets in the period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company elects to use three-month Term SOFR plus a ten-point credit spread adjustment plus the margin on SOFR required by the 2019 Credit Agreement to pay interest on its debt.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that affect, among other things, the ability of the first lien leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 35.0% of the commitments thereunder (excluding certain letters of credit), of no greater than 3.80 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with its financial performance covenant.

There were no repayments of outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, for information related to term loan activity subsequent to March 31, 2024.

Share Repurchase Programs

In December 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "2024 Share Repurchase Program") authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock through December 31, 2025. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, which took effect in December 2023, the Company may purchase its shares from time to time in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, pursuant to open market purchases, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The amount and timing of purchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the Company's shares, trading volume, capital availability, Company performance and general economic and market conditions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program can be suspended or discontinued at any time.

No shares were repurchased by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the same period in 2023, the Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $32.9 million, which included $0.2 million of excise taxes payable on shares repurchased, for an average price of $31.88 per share.

As of March 31, 2024, $95.2 million was available for future repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, and a cumulative total of 11.3 million shares of Common Stock had been repurchased under programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors at a total cost of $295.8 million for an average price of $26.26 per share.

NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share from net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:

| Basic: Weighted average number of shares outstanding | 64,389                        | 67,288   |
| Plus: Incremental shares from assumed conversion of dilutive instruments | 1,583                         | 2,439    |
| Diluted: Weighted average number of shares outstanding | 65,972                        | 69,727   |
| Earnings per share   |                               |          |

| Diluted:             | $ 0.84                        | $ 0.71   |


For the three months ended March 31, 2024, 0.5 million of unvested share-based compensation awards were excluded from the computation of weighted average shares for diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive (2023: 0). Holders of unvested share-based compensation awards do not have rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the shares covered by the awards.

(2)On October 30, 2023, the Company terminated the Swap. The termination resulted in a $44.4 million deferred gain recorded in AOCI, before tax, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the hedged debt (through July 1, 2026). Please refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the monetization of the gain on the Swap.

NOTE 14. DERIVATIVES

Interest Rate Swaps

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction ("Swap") entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $37.5 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

The following tables summarize the classification of the Swap in our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the "Company," "Victory," or in the first-person notations of "we," "us," and "our" shall mean Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

**Objective**

The objective of this section of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is intended to provide a discussion and analysis, from management's perspective, of the key performance indicators and material information necessary to assess our financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition, we also discuss the Company's contractual and off-balance sheet arrangements. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in "Forward-Looking Statements" included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**Overview**

**Our Business** – Victory is a diversified global asset management firm with total client assets of $175.5 billion, assets under management of $170.3 billion and other assets of $5.1 billion as of March 31, 2024. The Company operates a next-generation business model combining boutique investment qualities with the benefits of an integrated, centralized operating and distribution platform.

The Company provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors with 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform. Victory Capital offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products ("VIPs"), alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. Victory Capital's strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts ("SMAs") and unified managed accounts ("UMAs") through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts ("CITs"), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities ("UCITs"). As of March 31, 2024, our Franchises and our Solutions Platform collectively managed a diversified set of 121 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients and direct investors.

**Franchises** – Our Franchises are largely operationally integrated but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates. Our largely integrated model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities.

**Solutions** – Our Solutions Platform consists of multi-asset, multi-manager, quantitative, rules-based, factor-based, and customized portfolios. These strategies are designed to achieve specific return characteristics, with products that include values-based and thematic outcomes and exposures. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds, UMA accounts, and rules-based and active ETFs under our VictoryShares ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing, and operational support functions.

Professionals within our institutional and retail distribution channels, direct investor business and marketing organization sell our products through our centralized distribution model. Our institutional sales team focuses on cultivating relationships with institutional consultants, who account for the majority of the institutional market, as well as asset allocators seeking sub-advisers. Our retail sales team offers intermediary and retirement platform clients, including broker-dealers, retirement platforms and RIA networks, mutual funds and ETFs as well as SMAs through wrap fee programs and access to our investment models through UMAs. Our direct investor business serves the investment needs of individual clients.

We have grown our total client assets from $17.9 billion following the management-led buyout with Crestview GP in August 2013 to $175.5 billion at March 31, 2024. We attribute this growth to our success in sourcing acquisitions and evolving them into organic growers, generating strong investment returns, and developing institutional, retail, and direct investor channels with deep penetration.

(1)Management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to measure the operating profitability of the business. These measures eliminate the impact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. These measures are explained in more detail and reconciled to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP in "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information."

(2)Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.

(3)Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Assets Under Management

Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on
our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment
performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various
strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain
high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy
when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re-open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and
confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle.
Due to rounding, AUM numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals provided.

March 31, 2024 AUM compared to December 31, 2023 AUM. At March 31, 2024, our total AUM was $170.3 billion, an increase of $9.0 billion, or 5.6%, from $161.3 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to market appreciation of $10.2 billion partially offset by net outflows of $1.1 billion.

Net outflows were driven by our U.S. mid cap, U.S. small cap, and U.S. large cap equity strategies as well as our Solutions platform of $0.5 billion, $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion, and $0.2 billion, respectively, partially offset by net inflows from our global non-U.S. equity strategies and Alternative investments platform of $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively.

General and Administrative

Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses were $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2023.

Change in Value of Consideration Payable for Acquisition of Business

Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023.

2023 were $0.5 million and $29 thousand, respectively. Restructuring and integration costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were primarily
due to personnel restructuring.

Interest Income and Other Income (Expense)

Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023. Interest income and other income/(expense) was income of $3.6 million and $1.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in dividend income and an
increase in the net unrealized fair value of deferred compensation plan investments over the comparable period.

comparable period.

22.5% and 20.4%, respectively. The increase was primarily due to changes in the levels of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and non-
deductible expenses over the comparable period.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information

We use non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business. Due to our acquisitive nature, there are a number of
acquisition and restructuring related expenses included in GAAP measures that we believe distort the economic value of our organization and we believe
that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. We have
included these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of
our Company. The non-GAAP measures we report are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation from GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated:

(7)Adding back debt issuance costs.
(8)Subtracting an estimate of income tax expense applied to the sum of the adjustments above.
(9)Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangible assets with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures at other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify these measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary uses of cash relate to repayment of our debt obligations, funding of acquisitions and working capital needs, repurchasing of shares and payment of dividends, which are all expected to be met through cash generated from our operations and available capital resources.
The following table shows our liquidity position as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Here's a Markdown version of the provided text, with tables formatted as HTML.  Since there are no tables in the provided text, no HTML tables will be included in the output.

(1)The balance at March 31, 2024 represents the Company's $99.9 million revolving credit facility and a $0.1 million standby letter of credit used as collateral for THB's real estate location.

We manage our cash balances in order to fund our day-to-day operations. Our accounts receivable consists primarily of investment management fees that have been earned but not yet received from clients, income and other taxes receivable, and amounts receivable from the funds. We perform a review of our receivables on a monthly basis to assess collectability. We maintained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (under the 2019 Credit Agreement) which had approximately $100.0 million undrawn as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

**2021 Debt Repricing**

On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the existing term loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the "Repriced Term Loans"). The Repriced Term Loans have substantially the same terms as the previously existing term loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans provided for a reduced applicable margin on LIBOR of 25 basis points. After the Second Amendment, the applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans was 2.25%.

**2021 Incremental Term Loans**

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the "2021 Incremental Term Loans") in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%.

**2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition**

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment.

The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment's effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company's term loans.

**2020 Swap Transaction**

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction ("Swap") entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $37.5 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company reclassified income of $4.2 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a result of changes in the fair value of the Swap.

Table of Contents

Due to the termination of the Swap, there was no amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to
Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap.

Contingent Consideration

At March 31, 2024, the Company had $149.4 million in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next year and three years
resulting from the WestEnd Acquisition. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an increase of $12.2 million in the
contingent payment liability associated with the WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2024, the Company paid $80.0 million in cash to sellers for the first WestEnd earn out
period payment. At March 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition contingent payments was $149.4 million, and a maximum of
$240.0 million in contingent consideration ($80.0 million per year) is potentially payable to sellers.

There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023.

Capital Requirements

Victory Capital Services is a registered broker-dealer subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Exchange Act, which requires
maintenance of certain minimum net capital levels. In addition, we have certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that have minimum capital requirements. As a
result, such subsidiaries of our Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parents.

Cash Flows

The following table is derived from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

(in thousands)

|                     | Three Months Ended March 31, |          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
|                     | 2024                         | 2023     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 68,684                      | $ 64,156  |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | (910)                         | (1,546)  |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | (111,342)                     | (62,469) |


Operating Activities - Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $68.7 million, compared to $64.2
million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2023. The $4.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was
primarily due to increases of $6.4 million and $1.4 million in net income and working capital items, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $3.3
million in non-cash items.

Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $64.2 million and consisted of $49.3 million of net income and
$30.1 million of non-cash items, partially offset by $15.2 million in working capital items.

Investing Activities - Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.9 million and consisted of net trading
activity of $0.4 million and $0.5 million of property and equipment purchases. The nature of our trading activities is further described in Note 2, Significant
Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $1.5 million and consisted of net trading activity of $1.0 million and
$0.6 million of property and equipment purchases.

Financing Activities - Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $111.3 million and was mostly attributable
to payment of consideration for acquisition, payment of dividends, payment of taxes related to net share settlements, and repurchases of common stock
of $80.0 million, $22.4 million, $6.0 million, and $2.9 million, respectively.

Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $62.5 million and was mostly attributable to repurchases of common
stock, payment of dividends, and payment of taxes related to net share settlements of $34.4 million, $22.1 million, and $7.7 million, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements and the notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require the use of estimates. Actual results will vary from these estimates. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is
included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Here's a Markdown version of the provided text, with tables formatted as HTML.  Since there are no tables in the provided text, no HTML table formatting is included.

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further.

The value of our AUM was approximately $170 billion at March 31 2024. A 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $90.1 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 53 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $102.0 million at the Victory Funds' aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 60 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. If the same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $69.7 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 41 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues.

Exchange Rate Risk

A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non-U.S. currencies, or may implement their own hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio's exposure to non-U.S. currency.

We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 11% of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately $1.9 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately $9.9 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 53 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On February 18, 2021, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into

an agreement to terminate the Swap, which was effective on October 30, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At
March 31, 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to
Note 9, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding as of such date and the applicable interest rate.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) at March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC and the information contained in this report. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividends may change at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividends, we consider general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions (including under the terms of our 2019 Credit Agreement as amended) and legal, tax, regulatory and such other factors as we may deem relevant. There have been no material changes to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

(c) Issuer purchases of equity securities.

In December 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company’s Common Stock through December 31, 2025. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, which took effect in December 2023, the Company may purchase its shares from time to time in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, pursuant to open market purchases, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The amount and timing of purchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the Company’s shares, trading volume, capital availability, Company performance and general economic and market conditions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program can be suspended or discontinued at any time.

No shares were repurchased by the Company during the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the same period in 2023, the Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $32.9 million, which included $0.2 million of excise taxes payable on shares repurchased, for an average price of $31.88 per share.

As of March 31, 2024, $95.2 million was available for future repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, and a cumulative total of 11.3 million shares of Common Stock had been repurchased under programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors at a total cost of $295.8 million for an average price of $26.26 per share.
