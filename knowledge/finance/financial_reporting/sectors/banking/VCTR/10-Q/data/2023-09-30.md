Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results or outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized.

Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions, data or judgments that prove to be incorrect. Actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and factors, they include, among others, the following; reductions in assets under management ("AUM") based on investment performance, client withdrawals, difficult market conditions and other factors such as the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel or a pandemic; the nature of our contracts and investment advisory agreements; our ability to maintain historical returns and sustain our historical growth; our dependence on third parties to market our strategies and provide products or services for the operation of our business; our ability to retain key investment professionals or members of our senior management team; our reliance on the technology systems supporting our operations; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new companies; the concentration of our investments in long only small- and mid-cap equity and U.S. clients; risks and uncertainties associated with non-U.S. investments; our efforts to establish and develop new teams and strategies; the ability of our investment teams to identify appropriate investment opportunities; our ability to limit employee misconduct; our ability to meet the guidelines set by our clients; our exposure to potential litigation (including administrative or tax proceedings) or regulatory actions; our ability to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities; our substantial indebtedness; the potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to our exchange traded fund ("ETF") platform; our determination that we are not required to register as an "investment company" under the 1940 Act; the fluctuation of our expenses; our ability to respond to recent trends in the investment management industry; the level of regulation on investment management firms and our ability to respond to regulatory developments; the competitiveness of the investment management industry; the level of control over us retained by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P.; our status as an emerging growth company ("EGC"); and other risks and factors included, but not limited to, those listed under the caption "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 6, 2023, which is accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and other factors, the forward-looking statements contained in this report might not prove to be accurate.

# VICTORY CAPITAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

**NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS**

Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the "Company," "Victory," or in the first-person notations of "we," "us," and "our"), was formed on February 13, 2013 for the purpose of acquiring Victory Capital Management Inc. ("VCM") and Victory Capital Services, Inc. ("VCS"), formerly known as Victory Capital Advisers, Inc., which occurred on August 1, 2013. On February 12, 2018, the Company completed the initial public offering (the "IPO") of its Common Stock, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol "VCTR."

On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the "USAA AMCO Acquisition" or "USAA AMCO") of USAA Asset Management Company and Victory Capital Transfer Agency, Inc. ("VCTA"), formerly known as the USAA Transfer Agency Company d/b/a USAA Shareholder Account Services. The USAA AMCO Acquisition included USAA's mutual fund and ETF businesses and its 529 Education Savings Plan.

**NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Basis of Presentation**

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. As such, the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023.

Principles of Consolidation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions. Our involvement with non-consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") includes sponsored investment funds and, in 2022, an equity method investment.

For further discussion regarding VIEs, refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. For further discussion on the equity method investment, refer to Note 13, Equity Method Investment, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Intangible Assets

Management periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of the Company's intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that a change in the useful life or impairment in value may have occurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a $3.8 million impairment loss on an indefinite-lived trade name asset to reduce the asset's carrying amount to its estimated fair value and to change the asset's estimated remaining useful life. The remaining book value of the asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period that is shorter than the asset's economic life. The impairment loss is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For further discussion regarding the Company's intangible asset policy, refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the notes. Actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023

* Expected Credit Losses: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 creates a new model for determining current expected credit losses ("CECL") on trade and other receivables, net investments in leases, contract assets and long-term receivables. The CECL impairment model requires companies to consider the risk of loss even if it is remote and to include forecasts of future economic conditions as well as information about past events and current conditions. The effective date for calendar-year public business entities was January 1, 2020. As an EGC, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023, and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

* Fair Value Measurements: In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, "Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions" to clarify guidance for determining the fair value of certain equity securities and eliminate diversity in practice. ASU 2022-03 states that contractual sale restrictions should not be considered when measuring the fair value of an equity security and requires new disclosures for entities with equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. As the Company will lose its EGC status as of December 31, 2023, the Company will adopt ASU 2022-03 on January 1, 2024, the effective date for calendar-year public business entities. Because the Company does not have equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, ASU 2022-03 is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company's control including customer or underlying investor contributions and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service.

Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.

AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds and certain other pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed.

Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change.

The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct services are received in exchange for these payments.

Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of investment performance on a client's account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the customer. Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer's contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement with certain equity and fixed income Victory Funds III took effect on July 1, 2020 and is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month.

Fund Administration Fees

The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory

Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets and constraints are removed. The Company's fund administration fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

Fund Transfer Agent Fees

The Company recognizes fund transfer agent fees using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund transfer agent fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to either the average daily net assets of the Victory Funds III for which transfer agent services are provided or number of accounts in the Victory Funds III. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets or actual number of accounts and constraints are removed. The Company's fund transfer agent fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company also receives fees for sub-transfer agency services under contracts with the Victory Funds for member class shares. Sub-transfer agency fees are recognized and recorded in a manner similar to fund transfer agent fees and are recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. As the Company is the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the Victory Funds III and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

Fund Distribution Fees

The Company receives compensation for sales and sales-related services promised under distribution contracts with the Victory Funds. Revenue is measured in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing distribution services. Distribution fees are generally calculated as a percentage of average net assets in the Victory Funds. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the services is transferred to customers, which is upon investor subscription or redemption.

Based on the nature of the calculation, the revenue for these services is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company may recognize distribution fee revenue in the current period that pertains to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods as variable consideration is recognized only when uncertainties are resolved. The Company's distribution fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. The Company is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of the Company's revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties.

Costs Incurred to Obtain or Fulfill Customer Contracts

The Company is required to capitalize certain costs directly related to the acquisition or fulfillment of a contact with a customer. Victory has not identified any sales-based compensation or similar costs that meet the definition of an incremental cost to acquire a contract and as such we have no intangible assets related to contract acquisitions.

Direct costs incurred to fulfill services under the Company's distribution contracts include sales commissions paid to third party dealers for the sale of Class C Shares. The Company may pay upfront sales commissions to dealers and institutions that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commission payments with respect to Class C shares equal 1.00% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit.

Valuation of AUM and fund investments

The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based

## WestEnd Acquisition (Continued)

The estimated fair value for contingent consideration payable to sellers is estimated using the real options method. WestEnd net revenue growth is simulated in a risk-neutral framework to calculate expected probability-weighted earn out payments, which are then discounted from the expected payment dates at the relevant cost of debt. Significant assumptions and inputs include the WestEnd net revenue projected annual growth rate, the market price of risk adjustment for revenue, which adjusts the projected revenue growth rate to a risk-neutral expected growth rate, revenue volatility and discount rate. The market price of risk adjustment for revenue and revenue volatility are based on data for comparable companies. As the contingent consideration represents a subordinate, unsecured claim of the Company, the Company assesses a discount rate which incorporates adjustments for credit risk and the subordination of the contingent consideration.

The fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was estimated at $213.2 million as of September 30, 2023 and $202.7 million as of December 31, 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the liability was an increase of $7.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the liability decreased by $13.2 million and $31.5 million, respectively. The impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation of the contingent consideration liability is recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Significant inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration payable to sellers as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows and are approximate values:

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company determines the fair value of certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value determinations utilize a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability.

Classification within the fair value hierarchy contains three levels:

• Level 1—Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
• Level 2—Valuation inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured.
• Level 3—Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Level 1 assets consist of money market funds and open-end mutual funds. The fair values for these assets are determined utilizing quoted market prices for identical assets.

The interest rate swap (the “Swap”) asset represents amounts receivable under a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction entered into by the Company on March 27, 2020. The fair value of the Swap is included in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Pricing was determined based on a third party, model-derived valuation in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets (Level 2). Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further detail on the Swap.

Contingent consideration arrangements include the USAA AMCO and WestEnd earn-out payment liabilities at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Contingent consideration arrangements are included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of September 30, 2023, the USAA AMCO Acquisition earn-out payment liability represents the actual amount due to sellers for the fourth and final earn-out period ended July 31, 2023.

NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 differs from the United States federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes, excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and certain non-deductible expenses.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the provision for income taxes was $13.9 million and $12.6 million, or 21.1% and 14.7%, of pre-tax income respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the provision for income taxes was $44.4 million and $57.6 million, or 22.0% and 20.5% of pre-tax income respectively.

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the effective tax rate for the same periods in 2022 mainly due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

No valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets in the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

The Company elects to use three-month term SOFR plus a ten-point credit spread adjustment plus the margin on SOFR required by the 2019 Credit Agreement to pay interest on its debt.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that affect, among other things, the ability of the first lien leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 35.0% of the commitments thereunder (excluding certain letters of credit), of no greater than 3.80 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with the financial performance covenant.

There were no repayments of outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

A total of $29.6 million and $144.6 million of the outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement was repaid during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The Company recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of $0.4 million and $2.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to repayments of term loan principal.

NOTE 14. DERIVATIVES

Interest Rate Swaps

On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into the Swap to manage interest rate risk associated with a portion of its floating-rate long-term debt. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Under the terms of the original Swap agreement, the Company paid interest at a fixed rate of interest on a quarterly basis and received interest at the three-month LIBOR rate in effect for that quarter.

On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $450 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $450 million of the Company's outstanding term loan debt through July 1, 2026 changed from 3.215% to 3.149% as a result of the amendment to the Swap.

The designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how the Company reflects the change in fair value of the derivative instrument. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if, at inception, it meets defined correlation and effectiveness criteria. These criteria require that the anticipated cash flows and/or changes in fair value of the hedging instrument substantially offset those of the position being hedged. The Swap is assessed for effectiveness and continued qualification for hedge accounting on a quarterly basis. Since inception, the Swap was deemed to be highly effective.

The Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Swap is measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective. Gains or losses from the Swap are reclassified to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at September 30, 2023 of $4.8 million is included in other assets in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table summarizes the classification of the Swap in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the notional amount at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

|  | Balance Sheets | Description | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Other assets |  | Fair value of interest rate swap | $ 45,314 | $ 46,931 |
|  |  | Notional amount | 450,000 | 450,000 |

In general, our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 5 years. These leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from two to five years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable lease costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease costs are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor.

Management Company attributable to all "non-managed money"-related AUM in each of the first four years following the closing date. In the fourth
quarter of 2020, we paid $37.5 million in cash to sellers for the first annual contingent payment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we paid $37.5 million in
cash to sellers for the second annual contingent payment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company paid $37.5 million in cash to sellers for the third
annual earn out period for the USAA AMCO Acquisition.

As of September 30, 2023, contingent consideration payable to sellers was $36.4 million, the actual amount due to sellers for the fourth and final earn out
period. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was $27.7 million. Contingent consideration
payable to sellers is recorded in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
increase in the liability of $2.7 million and $8.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the increase in the liability of $2.7
million and a decrease in the liability of $9.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were recorded in change in value of
consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the
Company paid $36.4 million to sellers for the fourth and final earn out period. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, for further details on the USAA AMCO
Acquisition.

<sup>(1)</sup> Management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to measure the operating profitability of the business. These measures eliminate the impact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. These measures are explained in more detail and reconciled to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP in "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information."

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.
(3) Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up in
basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from
amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our
acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.
Assets Under Management
Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on
our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment
performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various
strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain
high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy
when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re-open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and
confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle.
Due to rounding, AUM numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals provided.
The following table presents our AUM by asset class as of the dates indicated:

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information

We use non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business. Due to our acquisitive nature, there are a number of acquisition and restructuring related expenses included in GAAP measures that we believe distort the economic value of our organization and we believe that many investors use this information when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. We have included these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of our Company. The non-GAAP measures we report are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation from GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated:

(10) Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangible assets with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures at other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify these measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary uses of cash relate to repayment of our debt obligations, funding of acquisitions and working capital needs, repurchasing of shares and payment of dividends, which are all expected to be met through cash generated from our operations and available capital resources.

The following table shows our liquidity position as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

| (in thousands) | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
|---|---|---|
| Cash and cash equivalents | $ 107,987 | $ 38,171 |
| Accounts and other Receivables | 95,174 | 84,473 |

| Accounts and other payables | (111,719) | (109,320) |

(1) The balances at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 represent the Company's $99.9 million revolving credit facility and a $0.1 million standby letter of credit used as collateral for THB's real estate location.

We manage our cash balances in order to fund our day-to-day operations. Our accounts receivable consists primarily of investment management fees that have been earned but not yet received from clients, income and other taxes receivable, and amounts receivable from the funds. We perform a review of our receivables on a monthly basis to assess collectability. We maintained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (under the 2019 Credit Agreement) which had approximately $100.0 million undrawn as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

2021 Debt Repricing

On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the existing term loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the "Repriced Term Loans"). The Repriced Term Loans have substantially the same terms as the previously existing term loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans provided for a reduced applicable margin on LIBOR of 25 basis points. After the Second Amendment, the applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans was 2.25%.

2021 Incremental Term Loans

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the "2021 Incremental Term Loans") in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%. Original issue discount was $2.5 million for the 2021 Incremental Term Loans. The Company incurred a total of $9.1 million of other third party costs related to the 2021 Incremental Term Loans, which were recorded as term loan debt issuance costs.

2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment. The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment's effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company's term loans.

2020 Swap Transaction

On March 27, 2020, the Company executed a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction ("Swap") to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap ("the Swap Amendment") to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $450 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $450 million of the Company's outstanding term loan debt through July 1, 2026 changed from 3.215% to 3.149% as a result of the Swap Amendment. At September 30, 2023, the $450 million notional value Swap had a fair value of $45.3 million, which was included in other assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a loss, net of tax, of $56 thousand and $1.2 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reclassified income of $5.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap.

Contingent Consideration

At September 30, 2023, the Company had $249.6 million in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next year and three years resulting from the USAA AMCO and WestEnd Acquisitions, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded increases of $2.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, in contingent payment liabilities associated with the USAA AMCO Acquisition and increases of $7.6 million and $10.5 million,

respectively, in contingent payment liabilities associated WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in
the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At September 30, 2023, the contingent consideration payable for the USAA AMCO Acquisition was $36.4 million, the actual amount due to sellers for the
fourth and final earn out period. At September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition contingent payments was $213.2 million,
and a maximum of $320.0 million in contingent consideration ($80.0 million per year) is potentially payable to sellers.
There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022.

Capital Requirements

Victory Capital Services is a registered broker-dealer subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Exchange Act, which requires
maintenance of certain minimum net capital levels. In addition, we have certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that have minimum capital requirements. As a
result, such subsidiaries of our Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parents.

property and equipment purchases of $4.4 million and $1.9 million of net trading activity.

Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $7.7 million and consisted of primarily of property and
equipment purchases of $4.3 million, $2.5 million of net trading activity and $0.9 million for acquisition of business and assets, net of cash acquired.

Financing Activities – Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $157.1 million and was mostly
attributable to repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and net activity related to stock-based equity awards of $81.8 million, $64.8 million,
and $10.5 million, respectively.

Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $263.1 million and was mostly attributable to repayment of long-

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements and the notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require the use of estimates. Actual results will vary from these estimates. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is
included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. A
complete description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk – Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further.

The value of our AUM was approximately $154 billion at September 30, 2023. A 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $80.1 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $93.9 million at the Victory Funds' aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 61 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. If the same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $50.8 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 33 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues.

Exchange Rate Risk - A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non-U.S. currencies, or may implement their own hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio's exposure to non-U.S. currency.

We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 10% of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately $1.5 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately $7.8 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

We operate in several foreign countries and incur operating expenses associated with these operations. In addition, we have revenue and revenue-sharing arrangements that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies. We do not believe foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk - Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Original Term Loan through the Original Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $450 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $450 million

of the Company's outstanding term loan debt through July 1, 2026 changed from 3.22% to 3.15% as a result of the Swap Amendment. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At September 30, 2023, we were exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the unhedged amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding as of such date and the applicable interest rate.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

(c) Issuer purchases of equity securities.

In March 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "2023 Share Repurchase Program") authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock. Under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, which took effect in March 2023, the Company may purchase its shares from time to time through March 31, 2025 in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, pursuant to open market purchases, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The amount and timing of purchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the Company's shares, trading volume, capital availability, Company performance and general economic and market conditions. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program can be suspended or discontinued at any time. The former $100.0 million share repurchase program, which took effect in May 2022, was completed in March 2023.

The Company did not make any repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $77.3 million, which included $0.5 million of excise taxes payable on shares repurchased, for an average price of $32.05. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, 0.8 million and 1.8 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $22.8 million and $49.2 million for an average price of $27.86 and $28.06.

As of September 30, 2023, a total of $51.9 million was available for future repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, and a cumulative total of 9.5 million shares of Common Stock had been repurchased under programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors at a total cost of $238.6 million for an average price of $25.07 per share.

The following table sets out information regarding purchases of equity securities by the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
