## NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## Basis of Presentation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. As such, the information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

## Principles of Consolidation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions. Our involvement with non-consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") includes sponsored investment funds.

For further discussion regarding VIEs, refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the notes. Actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates.

## New Accounting Pronouncements

## Recently Issued Accounting Standards

· Segment Reporting : In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"). ASU 2023-07 expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-07 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.

· Income Taxes : In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 revises income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information as well as the effectiveness of certain other income tax disclosures. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The standard should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.

## Revenue

The Company's revenue includes fees earned from providing;

- · investment management services,
- · fund administration services,
- · fund transfer agent services, and
- · fund distribution services.

Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration

## Table of Contents

as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company's control including customer or underlying investor contributions and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service.

## Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.

AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds and certain other pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed.

Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change.

The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct services are received in exchange for these payments.

Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of investment performance on a client's account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the customer. Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer's contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement with certain equity and fixed income Victory Funds III is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month.

## Fund Administration Fees

The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the

## Table of Contents

value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets and constraints are removed. The Company's fund administration fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

## Fund Compliance Fees

The Company has an agreement to provide compliance design, administration and oversight services for the Victory Funds and the VictoryShares in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act. The Company furnishes a VCM employee to serve as the Chief Compliance Officer and provides other compliance personnel and resources reasonably necessary to perform the services under this agreement. The Company earns a fixed annual fee for these compliance services which is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

## Fund Transfer Agent Fees

The Company recognizes fund transfer agent fees using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund transfer agent fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to either the average daily net assets of the Victory Funds III for which transfer agent services are provided or number of accounts in the Victory Funds III. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets or actual number of accounts and constraints are removed. The Company's fund transfer agent fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company also receives fees for sub-transfer agency services under contracts with the Victory Funds for member class shares. Sub-transfer agency fees are recognized and recorded in a manner similar to fund transfer agent fees and are recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. As the Company is the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the Victory Funds III and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis.

## Fund Distribution Fees

The Company receives compensation for sales and sales-related services promised under distribution contracts with the Victory Funds. Revenue is measured in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing distribution services. Distribution fees are generally calculated as a percentage of average net assets in the Victory Funds. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the services is transferred to customers, which is upon investor subscription or redemption.

Based on the nature of the calculation, the revenue for these services is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company may recognize distribution fee revenue in the current period that pertains to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods as variable consideration is recognized only when uncertainties are resolved. The Company's distribution fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. The Company is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of the Company's revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties.

Included in fund distribution fees are transaction and account-level fees paid by VCS brokerage platform customers for trade execution, cash transfer and other services.

## Costs Incurred to Obtain or Fulfill Customer Contracts

The Company is required to capitalize certain costs directly related to the acquisition or fulfillment of a contact with a customer. Victory has not identified any sales-based compensation or similar costs that meet the definition of an incremental cost to acquire a contract and as such we have no intangible assets related to contract acquisitions.

Direct costs incurred to fulfill services under the Company's distribution contracts include sales commissions paid to third party dealers for the sale of Class C Shares. The Company may pay upfront sales commissions to dealers and institutions

## Table of Contents

that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commission payments with respect to Class C shares equal 1.00% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit.

## Valuation of AUM and fund investments

The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company's other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.

The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds' net asset values or the total fair value of the funds' portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees.

For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company's total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation.

## NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS

## USAA AMCO Acquisition

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made the fourth and final earn-out payment due to sellers under the terms of the USAA AMCO purchase agreement.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in the USAA AMCO contingent consideration liability of $2.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, was recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

## NEC Acquisition

Under the terms of the NEC purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional $35.0 million in cash based on NEC's net revenue growth over a six-year period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the 36-month, 48-month and 60-month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the "Start Date") for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments, less any contingent payments previously paid, is due upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date.

The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for postclosing services. The Company records compensation expense over the estimated service period in an amount equal to the total contingent payments currently forecasted to be paid.

At September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the contingent payments are no longer probable of occurring and reduced the liability for NEC contingent payments to zero. The liability for NEC contingent payments totaled $13.7 million as of December 31, 2023 which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to the NEC contingent payment compensation expense was a decrease of $15.2 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in personnel compensation and benefits. Expense recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

## WestEnd Acquisition

Under the terms of the WestEnd purchase agreement, a maximum of $320.0 million ($80.0 million per year) of contingent payments is payable to sellers. Contingent earn-out payments are based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during each of the first four years following the WestEnd Closing, subject to certain "catch-up" provisions over a five and one-half year period following the WestEnd Closing.

The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was $139.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and $217.2 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company paid $80.0 million in cash to sellers as a catch-up payment for the first earn-out period.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in the liability was a decrease of $1.6 million and an increase of $2.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the liability was an increase of $7.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The impact of decreasing or increasing the valuation of the contingent consideration liability is recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers is estimated using the real options method. WestEnd net revenue growth is simulated in a risk-neutral framework to calculate expected probability-weighted earn out payments, which are then discounted from the expected payment dates at the relevant cost of debt. Significant assumptions and inputs include the WestEnd net revenue projected annual growth rate, the market price of risk adjustment for revenue, which adjusts the projected revenue growth rate to a risk-neutral expected growth rate, revenue volatility and discount rate. The market price of risk adjustment for revenue and revenue volatility are based on data for comparable companies. As the contingent consideration represents a subordinate, unsecured claim of the Company, the Company assesses a discount rate which incorporates adjustments for credit risk and the subordination of the contingent consideration.

Significant inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration payable to sellers as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows and are approximate values:

## Amundi US Contribution

On July 8, 2024, the Company, Amundi and, solely for certain provisions thereof, Amundi S.A., ("Amundi Parent," and together with Amundi, the "Amundi Parties") entered into the Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Amundi will contribute to the Company, all of the shares of Amundi US. The contribution will result in Amundi US becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory.

Amundi US, based in Boston, Massachusetts, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi, which is headquartered in Paris, France. Amundi US's activities are principally conducted by its wholly owned subsidiary Amundi US, Inc. Amundi US, Inc. specializes in providing and distributing investment solutions to a wide range of clients and investors, including institutional investors, corporations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and individual investors.

At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement (the "Closing"), in exchange for the shares of Amundi US, Amundi will receive 26.1% of the Company's fully diluted shares after giving effect to that issuance (the "Base Share Consideration"). This will be composed of newly issued shares of the Company Common Stock, par value $0.01, representing 4.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, after giving effect to that issuance, and the balance in newly issued shares of a new class of the Company Preferred Stock. The Base Share Consideration is subject to customary adjustments based on the level of client consents received, Amundi US's net working capital, debt, cash and transaction expenses as described in the Contribution Agreement.

At the Closing, the Company and Amundi will enter into a shareholder agreement (the "Shareholder Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Amundi will be (i) will be granted certain resale shelf and piggyback registration rights in respect of the shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock issued to it under the Contribution Agreement (the "Acquired Shares"), and (ii) is entitled to nominate two members of the Board for so long as it holds a certain amount of the Acquired Shares. In addition, for a period of three years following the Closing, Amundi will be subject to a

customary "lock-up" of the Acquired Shares (subject to certain exceptions) and a standstill, which among other things, prohibits Amundi from acquiring additional equity securities of the Company (subject to certain exceptions).

The Amundi Parties, the Company, and VCM have also entered into an Off-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement and an On-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement which will become effective on the date of the Closing (except with respect to certain specified provisions set forth therein, which became effective as of the entry into such agreements).

The Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and regulatory authorizations.

## Acquisition-related costs

Acquisition-related costs include legal fees, advisory services, mutual fund proxy voting costs and other one-time expenses related to business combinations. The Company expensed $5.1 million and $9.2 million in acquisition-related costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($0.1 million in 2023), respectively. These amounts are included in acquisition-related costs in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and relate primarily to the Amundi US Acquisition.

## NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company determines the fair value of certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value determinations utilize a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability.

Classification within the fair value hierarchy contains three levels:

- · Level 1-Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
- · Level 2-Valuation inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured.

· Level 3-Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Level 1 assets consist of money market funds and open-end mutual funds. The fair values for these assets are determined utilizing quoted market prices for identical assets.

Contingent consideration arrangements represent the WestEnd earn-out payment liability, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Significant unobservable inputs for the option pricing model used to determine the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition earn-out payment liability include the WestEnd net revenue projected growth rate, revenue volatility, market price of risk and discount rate. An increase in the projected growth rate for net revenue results in a higher fair value for the earn-out payment liability while an increase in the discount rate results in a lower fair value for the earn-out payment liability. An increase in the market price of risk and revenue volatility results in a lower fair value. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, for further details related to the valuation of contingent consideration payable related to the WestEnd Acquisition.

Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangement liabilities, realized or unrealized, are recorded in earnings and are included in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table presents the balance of the change in contingent consideration arrangement liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

There were no transfers between any of the Level 1, 2 and 3 categories in the fair value measurement hierarchy from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The Company recognizes transfers at the end of the reporting period.

The net carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of our long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 is considered to be its carrying value as the interest rate on the bank debt is variable and approximates current market rates. As a result, Level 2 inputs are utilized to determine the fair value of our long-term debt.

## NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the United States federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes, excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and certain non-deductible expenses.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was $25.5 million and $13.9 million, or 23.7% and 21.1%, of pre-tax income, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was $63.2 million and $44.4 million, or 23.0% and 22.0% of pre-tax income, respectively.

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the effective tax rates for the same periods in 2023 due to decreased excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and increased non-deductible expenses.

No valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets in the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has released a framework ("Pillar 2") to introduce a global minimum tax of 15% for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds. Certain aspects of Pillar 2 are effective January 1, 2024, and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. Although the U.S. has not yet enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain countries have already adopted, or are in the process of adopting, legislation to implement Pillar 2. The Company continues to analyze Pillar 2 but does not currently expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or on our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations or statement of cash flows.

## NOTE 9. DEBT

On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $100.0 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 0.50% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement.

On July 1, 2024, the Company executed an agency succession agreement, by and among Barclays Bank PLC as the resigning administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2019 Credit Agreement and Royal Bank of Canada, as the successor administrative agent and collateral agent.

The Company elects to use three-month Term SOFR plus a ten-point credit spread adjustment plus the margin on SOFR required by the 2019 Credit Agreement to pay interest on its debt.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that affect, among other things, the ability of the first lien leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed 35.0% of the commitments thereunder (excluding certain letters of credit), of no greater than 3.80 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with its financial performance covenant.

There were no repayments of outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and no loss on debt extinguishment was recorded in the period. Repayments of outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement totaled $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the repayments of term loan principal.

There were no repayments of outstanding term loans under the 2019 Credit Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and no loss on debt extinguishment was recorded in these periods.

(2) On October 30, 2023, the Company terminated the Swap. The termination resulted in a $44.4 million deferred gain recorded in AOCI, before tax, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the hedged debt (through July 1, 2026). Please refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the monetization of the gain on the Swap.

## NOTE 14. DERIVATIVES

## Interest Rate Swaps

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction ("Swap") entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $29.1 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

The following tables summarize the classification of the Swap in our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

In general, our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 12 years. These leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from two to five years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable lease costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease costs are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor.

## Overview

Our Business - Victory is a diversified global asset management firm with total client assets of $181.1 billion, assets under management of $176.1 billion and other assets of $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Company operates a next-generation business model combining boutique investment qualities with the benefits of an integrated, centralized operating and distribution platform.

The Company provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors with 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform. Victory Capital offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products ("VIPs"), alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. Victory Capital's strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts ("SMAs") and unified managed accounts ("UMAs") through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts ("CITs"), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities ("UCITs"). As of September 30, 2024, our Franchises and our Solutions Platform collectively managed a diversified set of 126 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients and direct investors.

Franchises - Our Franchises are largely operationally integrated but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates. Our largely integrated model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities.

Solutions - Our Solutions Platform consists of multi-asset, multi-manager, quantitative, rules-based, factor-based, and customized portfolios. These strategies are designed to achieve specific return characteristics, with products that include values-based and thematic outcomes and exposures. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds, UMA accounts, and rules-based and active ETFs under our VictoryShares ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing, and operational support functions.

Professionals within our institutional and retail distribution channels, direct investor business and marketing organization sell our products through our centralized distribution model. Our institutional sales team focuses on cultivating relationships with institutional consultants, who account for the majority of the institutional market, as well as asset allocators seeking sub-advisers. Our retail sales team offers intermediary and retirement platform clients, including broker-dealers, retirement platforms and registered investment adviser networks, mutual funds and ETFs as well as SMAs through wrap fee programs and access to our investment models through UMAs. Our direct investor business serves the investment needs of individual clients.

We have grown our total client assets from $17.9 billion following the management-led buyout with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. in August 2013 to $181.1 billion at September 30, 2024. We attribute this growth to our success in sourcing

acquisitions and evolving them into organic growers, generating strong investment returns, and developing institutional, retail, and direct investor channels with deep penetration.

Amundi US Contribution On July 8, 2024, the Company, Amundi and, solely for certain provisions thereof, Amundi S.A., ("Amundi Parent," and together with Amundi, the "Amundi Parties") entered into the Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Amundi will contribute to the Company, all of the shares of Amundi US. The contribution will result in Amundi US becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory.

Amundi US, based in Boston, Massachusetts, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi, which is headquartered in Paris, France. Amundi US's activities are principally conducted by its wholly owned subsidiary Amundi US, Inc. Amundi US, Inc. specializes in providing and distributing investment solutions to a wide range of clients and investors, including institutional investors, corporations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and individual investors.

At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement (the "Closing"), in exchange for the shares of Amundi US, Amundi will receive 26.1% of the Company's fully diluted shares after giving effect to that issuance (the "Base Share Consideration"). This will be composed of newly issued shares of the Company Common Stock, par value $0.01, representing 4.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, after giving effect to that issuance, and the balance in newly issued shares of a new class of the Company Preferred Stock. The Base Share Consideration is subject to customary adjustments based on the level of client consents received, Amundi US's net working capital, debt, cash and transaction expenses as described in the Contribution Agreement.

At the Closing, the Company and Amundi will enter into a shareholder agreement (the "Shareholder Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Amundi will be (i) will be granted certain resale shelf and piggyback registration rights in respect of the shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock issued to it under the Contribution Agreement (the "Acquired Shares"), and (ii) is entitled to nominate two members of the Board for so long as it holds a certain amount of the Acquired Shares. In addition, for a period of three years following the Closing, Amundi will be subject to a customary "lock-up" of the Acquired Shares (subject to certain exceptions) and a standstill, which among other things, prohibits Amundi from acquiring additional equity securities of the Company (subject to certain exceptions).

The Amundi Parties, the Company, and VCM have also entered into an Off-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement and an On-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement which will become effective on the date of the Closing (except with respect to certain specified provisions set forth therein, which became effective as of the entry into such agreements).

The Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and regulatory authorizations.

## Assets Under Management

Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re-open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle. Due to rounding, AUM numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals provided.

The following table presents our AUM by asset class as of the dates indicated:

## Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information

We use non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business. Due to our acquisitive nature, there are a number of acquisition and restructuring related expenses included in GAAP measures that we believe distort the economic value of our organization and we believe that many investors use this information when assessing the

financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. We have included these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of our Company. The non-GAAP measures we report are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation from GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated:

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our nonGAAP measures may differ from similar measures at other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify these measures.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary uses of cash relate to repayment of our debt obligations, funding of acquisitions and working capital needs, repurchasing of shares and payment of dividends, which are all expected to be met through cash generated from our operations and available capital resources.

The following table shows our liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

| (in thousands)                                      | September 30, 2024   | December 31, 2023   |

We manage our cash balances in order to fund our day-to-day operations. Our accounts receivable consists primarily of investment management fees that have been earned but not yet received from clients, income and other taxes receivable, and amounts receivable from the funds. We perform a review of our receivables on a monthly basis to assess collectability.

We maintained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (under the 2019 Credit Agreement) which had approximately $100.0 million undrawn as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $100.0 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 0.50% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred $1.0 million in upfront fees, arranger fees and other third party costs related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, which were recorded to revolving credit facility debt issuance cost in other assets.

## 2021 Debt Repricing

On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the existing term loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the "Repriced Term Loans"). The Repriced Term Loans have

substantially the same terms as the previously existing term loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans provided for a reduced applicable margin on LIBOR of 25 basis points. After the Second Amendment, the applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans was 2.25%.

## 2021 Incremental Term Loans

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the "2021 Incremental Term Loans") in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%.

## 2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment.

The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment's effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company's term loans.

## 2020 Swap Transaction

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed Swap transaction entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $29.1 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reclassified income of $5.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a result of changes in the fair value of the Swap.

Due to the termination of the Swap, there was no amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap.

## Contingent Consideration

At September 30, 2024, the Company had $139.6 million in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next year and three years resulting from the WestEnd Acquisition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a decrease of $1.6 million and an increase of $2.4 million, respectively, in the contingent payment liability associated with the WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2024, the Company paid $80.0 million in cash to sellers for the first WestEnd earn out period payment. At September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition contingent payments was $139.6 million, and a maximum of $240.0 million in contingent consideration ($80.0 million per year) is potentially payable to sellers.

There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Capital Requirements

Victory Capital Services is a registered broker-dealer subject to the Uniform Net Capital requirements under the Exchange Act, which requires maintenance of certain minimum net capital levels. In addition, we have certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that have minimum capital requirements. As a result, such subsidiaries of our Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parents.

## Cash Flows

The following table is derived from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

## Market Risk

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further.

The value of our AUM was approximately $176 billion at September 30, 2024. A 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $91.5 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $103.8 million at the Victory Funds' aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 59 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. If the same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $70.4 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 40 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues.

## Exchange Rate Risk

A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non-U.S. currencies, or may implement their own hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio's exposure to non-U.S. currency.

We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 11% of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately $1.9 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately $10.1 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

## Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On February 18, 2021, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR

conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap, which was effective on October 30, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At September 30, 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding as of such date and the applicable interest rate.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) at September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II-OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On August 20, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Preliminary Proxy Statement, and on September 6, 2024, Victory filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in relation to Amundi contributing to Victory all of the shares of Amundi US, resulting in Victory acquiring Amundi US and Amundi US becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory. As of September 30, 2024, two complaints have been filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County by purported Victory stockholders against Victory and the members of the Victory board of directors (the "Board") in connection with the Contribution: Kent v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al ., Index No. 654929/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) and Lawrence v. Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., et al ., Index No. 654920/2024 (filed September 19, 2024) (collectively, the "Stockholder Litigation"). The complaints in the Stockholder Litigation include allegations that, among other things, the defendants caused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading Proxy Statement with the SEC relating to the proposed Contribution and assert claims for alleged negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence under New York common law. Additionally, since the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement, Victory received five demand letters from purported Victory stockholders alleging similar insufficiencies in the disclosures in the Preliminary Proxy Statement and/or the Proxy Statement (such letters, the "Demand Letters," and together with the Stockholder Litigation, the "Litigation Matters").

The plaintiffs in the Stockholder Litigation seek various remedies, which include, among other things: (i) enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed Contribution until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the Proxy Statement; (ii) in the event that the proposed Contribution is consummated, rescinding it or awarding actual and punitive damages to the plaintiffs; (iii) awarding the plaintiffs fees and expenses in connection with the Stockholder Litigation, including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees and expenses; and (iv) granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.

Victory believes that the allegations contained in the Litigation Matters are without merit, that the disclosures in the Proxy Statement comply with applicable laws, and that no further disclosures are required to supplement the Proxy Statement under applicable laws. Victory specifically denies all allegations in the Litigation Matters.

We cannot predict the outcome of the above matters or estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss, if any. Although the proceedings are subject to uncertainties inherent in the litigation process and the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, we intend to vigorously defend these cases. In addition to those items disclosed above, we are, from time to time, subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC and the information contained in this report. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividends may change at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividends, we consider general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions (including under the terms of our 2019 Credit Agreement as amended) and legal, tax, regulatory and such other factors as we may deem relevant. There have been no material changes to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

## (c) Issuer purchases of equity securities.

In December 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "2024 Share Repurchase Program") authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the Company's Common Stock through December 31, 2025. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, which took effect in December 2023, the Company may purchase its shares from time to time in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, pursuant to open market purchases, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC. The amount and timing of purchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors including the price and availability of the Company's shares, trading volume, capital availability, Company performance and general economic and market conditions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program can be suspended or discontinued at any time.

No shares were repurchased by the Company during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30 2023, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $77.3 million, which included $0.5 million of excise taxes payable on shares repurchased, for an average price of $32.05 per share.

As of September 30, 2024, $95.2 million was available for future repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, and a cumulative total of 11.3 million shares of Common Stock had been repurchased under programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors at a total cost of $295.8 million for an average price of $26.26 per share.

The following table sets out information regarding purchases of equity securities by the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
