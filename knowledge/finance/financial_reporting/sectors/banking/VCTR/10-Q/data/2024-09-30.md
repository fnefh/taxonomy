Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1. Organization and Nature of Business

Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the "Company," "Victory," or in the first-person notations of "we," "us," and "our"), was formed on February 13, 2013 for the purpose of acquiring Victory Capital Management Inc. ("VCM") and Victory Capital Services, Inc. ("VCS"), formerly known as Victory Capital Advisers, Inc., which occurred on August 1, 2013. On February 12, 2018, the Company completed the initial public offering (the "IPO") of its Class A common stock, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol "VCTR."

Victory provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors. With 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform, the Company offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active ETFs, institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products ("VIPs"), alternative investments, private closed-end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. The Company's strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts ("SMAs") and unified managed accounts ("UMAs") through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts ("CITs"), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities ("UCITs").

VCM is a registered investment adviser and provides mutual fund administrative services for the Victory Portfolios, Victory Variable Insurance Funds, the mutual fund series of the Victory Portfolios II and the Victory Portfolios III (collectively, the "Victory Funds"), a family of open-end mutual funds, and the VictoryShares (the Company's ETF brand). Additionally, VCM employs all of the Company's United States investment professionals across its Franchises and Solutions, which are not separate legal entities. VCM's wholly-owned subsidiaries include RS Investment Management (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., RS Investments (UK) Limited, Victory Capital Digital Assets, LLC and NEC Pipeline LLC. VCM's other wholly-owned subsidiary, RS Investments (HK) Limited, ceased operations in May 2023, and was deregistered and dissolved in May 2024.

VCS is registered with the SEC as an introducing broker-dealer and serves as distributor and underwriter for the Victory Funds, which includes the mutual funds of the Victory Portfolios III (the "Victory Funds III") and a 529 Education Savings Plan. VCS offers brokerage services to individual investors through an open architecture brokerage platform launched in April 2023. VCS is also the placement agent for certain private funds managed by VCM.

VCTA is registered with the SEC as a transfer agent for the Victory Funds III.

On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition (the "USAA AMCO Acquisition" or "USAA AMCO") of USAA Asset Management Company and Victory Capital Transfer Agency, Inc. ("VCTA"), formerly known as the USAA Transfer Agency Company d/b/a USAA Shareholder Account Services. The USAA AMCO Acquisition included USAA's mutual fund and ETF businesses and its 529 Education Savings Plan.

On November 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in New Energy Capital Partners ("NEC"). Founded in 2004 and based in Hanover, New Hampshire, NEC is an alternative asset management firm focused on debt and equity investments in clean energy infrastructure projects and companies through private closed-end funds (the "NEC Funds"). AUM acquired in the NEC acquisition totaled $0.8 billion as of November 1, 2021.

On December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition ("WestEnd Acquisition") of 100% of the equity interests in WestEnd Advisors, LLC ("WestEnd").

The firm offers four primary ETF strategies and one large cap core strategy, all in tax efficient Separately Managed Account (SMA) structures. AUM acquired in the WestEnd Acquisition totaled $19.3 billion on December 31, 2021. WestEnd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. and is the Company's second registered investment adviser.

On July 8, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with Amundi Asset Management S.A.S ("Amundi") whereby Amundi's U.S. business (formerly Pioneer Investments) will be combined into the Company. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Amundi US becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Victory in exchange for a 26.1% economic stake in the Company composed of newly issued shares of Victory's common stock (the "Company Common Stock") representing 4.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, after giving effect to that issuance, and the balance in newly issued shares of the Company's preferred stock (the "Company Preferred Stock").

Revenue

The Company's revenue includes fees earned from providing:

* investment management services,
* fund administration services,
* fund transfer agent services, and
* fund distribution services.

Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration

as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company's control including customer or underlying investor contributions and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable.

The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service.

Investment Management Fees

Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.

AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds and certain other pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed.

Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change.

The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the Victory Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct services are received in exchange for these payments.

Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of investment performance on a client's account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the customer. Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer's contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement with certain equity and fixed income Victory Funds III is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month.

Fund Administration Fees

The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the

that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commission payments with respect to Class C shares equal 1.00% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit.

**Valuation of AUM and fund investments**

The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company's other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service.

The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds' net asset values or the total fair value of the funds' portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees.

For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company's total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation.

**NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS**

**USAA AMCO Acquisition**

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made the fourth and final earn-out payment due to sellers under the terms of the USAA AMCO purchase agreement.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in the USAA AMCO contingent consideration liability of $2.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively, was recorded in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**NEC Acquisition**

Under the terms of the NEC purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional $35.0 million in cash based on NEC's net revenue growth over a six-year period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the 36-month, 48-month and 60-month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the "Start Date") for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12-month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments, less any contingent payments previously paid, is due upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date.

The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for post-closing services. The Company records compensation expense over the estimated service period in an amount equal to the total contingent payments currently forecasted to be paid.

At September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the contingent payments are no longer probable of occurring and reduced the liability for NEC contingent payments to zero. The liability for NEC contingent payments totaled $13.7 million as of December 31, 2023 which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations relating to the NEC contingent payment compensation expense was a decrease of $15.2 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in personnel compensation and benefits. Expense recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the United States federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes, excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and certain non-deductible expenses.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was $25.5 million and $13.9 million, or 23.7% and 21.1%, of pre-tax income, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes was $63.2 million and $44.4 million, or 23.0% and 22.0% of pre-tax income, respectively.

Table of Contents

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the effective tax rates for the same periods in 2023 due to decreased excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and increased non-deductible expenses.

No valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets in the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has released a framework ("Pillar 2") to introduce a global minimum tax of 15% for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds. Certain aspects of Pillar 2 are effective January 1, 2024, and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. Although the U.S. has not yet enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2, certain countries have already adopted, or are in the process of adopting, legislation to implement Pillar 2. The Company continues to analyze Pillar 2 but does not currently expect it to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or on our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations or statement of cash flows.

NOTE 9. DEBT

On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $100.0 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 0.50% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement.

On July 1, 2024, the Company executed an agency succession agreement, by and among Barclays Bank PLC as the resigning administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2019 Credit Agreement and Royal Bank of Canada, as the successor administrative agent and collateral agent.

being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the hedged debt (through July 1, 2026). Please refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further
information on the monetization of the gain on the Swap.

NOTE 14. DERIVATIVES

Interest Rate Swaps

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction ("Swap") entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $29.1 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.

The following tables summarize the classification of the Swap in our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

In general, our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 12 years. These leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from two to five years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable lease costs, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease costs are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the "Company," "Victory," or in the first-person notations of "we," "us," and "our" shall mean Victory Capital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

**Objective**

The objective of this section of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is intended to provide a discussion and analysis, from management's perspective, of the key performance indicators and material information necessary to assess our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, we also discuss the Company's contractual and off-balance sheet arrangements. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in "Forward-Looking Statements" included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**Overview**

**Our Business** – Victory is a diversified global asset management firm with total client assets of $181.1 billion, assets under management of $176.1 billion and other assets of $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Company operates a next-generation business model combining boutique investment qualities with the benefits of an integrated, centralized operating and distribution platform.

The Company provides specialized investment strategies to institutions, intermediaries, retirement platforms and individual investors with 11 autonomous Investment Franchises and a Solutions Platform. Victory Capital offers a wide array of investment products, including actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), institutional separate accounts, variable insurance products ("VIPs"), alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. Victory Capital's strategies are also offered through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail separately managed accounts ("SMAs") and unified managed accounts ("UMAs") through wrap account programs, Collective Investment Trusts ("CITs"), and undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities ("UCITs"). As of September 30, 2024, our Franchises and our Solutions Platform collectively managed a diversified set of 126 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients and direct investors.

**Franchises** – Our Franchises are largely operationally integrated but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates. Our largely integrated model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities.

**Solutions** – Our Solutions Platform consists of multi-asset, multi-manager, quantitative, rules-based, factor-based, and customized portfolios. These strategies are designed to achieve specific return characteristics, with products that include values-based and thematic outcomes and exposures. We offer our Solutions Platform through a variety of vehicles, including separate accounts, mutual funds, UMA accounts, and rules-based and active ETFs under our VictoryShares ETF brand. Like our Franchises, our Solutions Platform is operationally integrated and supported by our centralized distribution, marketing, and operational support functions.

Professionals within our institutional and retail distribution channels, direct investor business and marketing organization sell our products through our centralized distribution model. Our institutional sales team focuses on cultivating relationships with institutional consultants, who account for the majority of the institutional market, as well as asset allocators seeking sub-advisers. Our retail sales team offers intermediary and retirement platform clients, including broker-dealers, retirement platforms and registered investment adviser networks, mutual funds and ETFs as well as SMAs through wrap fee programs and access to our investment models through UMAs. Our direct investor business serves the investment needs of individual clients.

We have grown our total client assets from $17.9 billion following the management-led buyout with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. in August 2013 to $181.1 billion at September 30, 2024. We attribute this growth to our success in sourcing

issued shares of the Company Common Stock, par value $0.01, representing 4.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company

Common Stock issued to it under the Contribution Agreement (the "Acquired Shares"), and (ii) is entitled to nominate two members of the Board for so
long as it holds a certain amount of the Acquired Shares. In addition, for a period of three years following the Closing, Amundi will be subject to a
customary "lock-up" of the Acquired Shares (subject to certain exceptions) and a standstill, which among other things, prohibits Amundi from acquiring
additional equity securities of the Company (subject to certain exceptions).

The Amundi Parties, the Company, and VCM have also entered into an Off-Shore Master Distribution and Services Agreement and an On-Shore Master
Distribution and Services Agreement which will become effective on the date of the Closing (except with respect to certain specified provisions set forth
therein, which became effective as of the entry into such agreements).

The Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals
and regulatory authorizations.

Table of Contents

(1) Management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income to measure the operating profitability of the business. These measures eliminate the impact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. These measures are explained in more detail and reconciled to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP in "Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information."

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue.

(3) Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Assets Under Management

Our profitability is largely affected by the level and composition of our AUM (including asset class and distribution channel) and the effective fee rates on our products. The amount and composition of our AUM are, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including; (i) investment performance, including fluctuations in the financial markets and the quality of our investment decisions; (ii) client flows into and out of our various strategies and investment vehicles; (iii) industry trends toward products or strategies that we either do or do not offer; (iv) our ability to attract and retain high quality investment, distribution, marketing and management personnel; (v) our decision to close strategies or limit growth of assets in a strategy when we believe it is in the best interest of our clients or conversely to re-open strategies in part or entirely; and (vi) general investor sentiment and confidence. Our goal is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by Franchise and Solutions, asset class, distribution channel and vehicle. Due to rounding, AUM numbers presented in the tables below may not add up precisely to the totals provided.

We use non-GAAP performance measures to evaluate the underlying operations of our business. Due to our acquisitive nature, there are a number of acquisition and restructuring related expenses included in GAAP measures that we believe distort the economic value of our organization and we believe that many investors use this information when assessing the

financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. We have included these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with the
same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of our Company. The non-GAAP measures we report are Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income.

(9) Represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which we received a step-up
in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from
amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangible assets with a step-up in tax basis. Due to our
acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide us with a significant supplemental economic benefit.

Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-
GAAP measures may differ from similar measures at other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify these measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary uses of cash relate to repayment of our debt obligations, funding of acquisitions and working capital needs, repurchasing of shares and
payment of dividends, which are all expected to be met through cash generated from our operations and available capital resources.

(1) The balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 represent the Company's $99.9 million revolving credit facility and a $0.1 million standby letter of
credit used as collateral for THB's real estate location.

We manage our cash balances in order to fund our day-to-day operations. Our accounts receivable consists primarily of investment management fees
that have been earned but not yet received from clients, income and other taxes receivable, and amounts receivable from the funds. We perform a
review of our receivables on a monthly basis to assess collectability.

We maintained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (under the 2019 Credit Agreement) which had
approximately $100.0 million undrawn as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth
Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, extending the maturity date of the $100.0 million senior secured first lien revolving facility from July 1, 2024 to
March 31, 2026, and decreasing the drawn interest rate margin by 0.50% per annum. The revolving facility otherwise remains subject to substantially the
same terms as those set forth in the 2019 Credit Agreement. The Company incurred $1.0 million in upfront fees, arranger fees and other third party costs
related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement, which were recorded to revolving credit facility debt issuance cost in other assets.

2021 Debt Repricing

On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the "Second Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan
parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the
Company repriced the existing term loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the "Repriced Term Loans").
The Repriced Term Loans have

substantially the same terms as the previously existing term loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans
provided for a reduced applicable margin on LIBOR of 25 basis points. After the Second Amendment, the applicable margin on LIBOR under the
Repriced Term Loans was 2.25%.

2021 Incremental Term Loans

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors
party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the
Company obtained incremental term loans (the "2021 Incremental Term Loans") in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the
proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in
December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis
point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%.

2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the
interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread
adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment.

The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment's effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest
periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into
Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans
were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company's term loans.

2020 Swap Transaction

In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the floating-to-fixed Swap transaction entered into in 2020 to effectively fix the interest
rate on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026.

The deferred gain on the termination of the Swap is being amortized on a straight-line basis through July 1, 2026 and is included in interest expense and
other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
unamortized deferred gain on Swap monetization was $29.1 million and $41.6 million, respectively, before tax.

The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. Prior to its termination, the Swap was measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses
deferred and included in AOCI(L), net of tax, to the extent the hedge was determined to be effective. Gains or losses were reclassified to interest
expenses and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period during which the hedged
transaction affected earnings.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reclassified income of $5.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively, from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense and other financing costs on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations as a result of changes in the fair value of the Swap.

Due to the termination of the Swap, there was no amount receivable from the Swap counterparty at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer
to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap.

Contingent Consideration

At September 30, 2024, the Company had $139.6 million in contingent consideration that is estimated to be payable over the next year and three years
resulting from the WestEnd Acquisition. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a decrease of $1.6 million
and an increase of $2.4 million, respectively, in the contingent payment liability associated with the WestEnd Acquisition, which is included in
consideration payable for acquisition of business in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In March 2024, the Company paid $80.0
million in cash to sellers for the first WestEnd earn out period payment. At September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the WestEnd Acquisition
contingent payments was $139.6 million, and a maximum of $240.0 million in contingent consideration ($80.0 million per year) is potentially payable to
sellers.

There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023.

Operating Activities – Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $248.2 million, compared to $233.2 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2023. The $15.0 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is due to a $54.0 million increase in net income partially offset by a $31.8 million and $7.2 million decrease in non-cash and working capital items, respectively.

Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $233.2 million and comprised of $158.0 million and $87.7 million of net income and non-cash items, respectively, partially offset by $12.5 million in working capital source of cash.

Investing Activities – Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.6 million and consisted of primarily of property and equipment purchases of $1.1 million and $0.5 million of net trading activity.

Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $6.3 million and consisted of primarily of property and equipment purchases of $4.4 million and $1.9 million of net trading activity.

Financing Activities – Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $182.0 million and was mostly attributable to payment of consideration for acquisition, payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and net activity related to stock-based equity awards of $80.0 million, $73.0 million, $9.5 million, $6.7 million, and $11.8 million, respectively.

Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $157.1 million and was mostly attributable to repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and net activity related to stock-based equity awards of $81.8 million, $64.8 million, and $10.5 million, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements and the notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates. Actual results will vary from these estimates. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. A complete description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management, fund administration and distribution fees, which are primarily based on the market value of our AUM. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such depreciation could cause our clients to withdraw their assets in favor of other investment alternatives that they perceive to offer higher returns or lower risk, which could cause our revenues and net income to decline further.

The value of our AUM was approximately $176 billion at September 30, 2024. A 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM, if proportionately distributed over all of our strategies, products and client relationships, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $91.5 million at our weighted-average fee rate of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of declining fee rates from larger relationships and differences in our fee rates across investment strategies, a change in the composition of our AUM, in particular, an increase in the proportion of our total AUM attributable to strategies, clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates, could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted-average fee rate. The same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM, if attributed entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the AUM of the Victory Funds, to which we provide a range of services in addition to those provided to institutional separate accounts, would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $103.8 million at the Victory Funds' aggregate weighted-average fee rate of 59 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. If the same 10% increase or decrease in the value of our total AUM was attributable entirely to a proportionate increase or decrease in the assets of our institutional separate accounts, it would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately $70.4 million at the weighted-average fee rate across all of our institutional separate accounts of 40 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

As is customary in the investment management industry, clients invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to certain asset classes, which exposes their investment to the benefits and risks of those asset classes. We believe our clients invest in each of our strategies in order to gain exposure to the portfolio securities of the respective strategies and may implement their own risk management program or procedures. We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level or within individual strategies the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks, such as sector and currency risks, are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to particular risks. While negative returns in our strategies and net client cash outflows do not directly reduce the assets on our balance sheet (because the assets we manage are owned by our clients, not us), any reduction in the value of our AUM would result in a reduction in our revenues.

Exchange Rate Risk

A portion of the accounts that we advise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of that AUM will decrease with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. Each investment team monitors its own exposure to exchange rate risk and makes decisions on how to manage that risk in the portfolios they manage. We believe many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to non-U.S. currencies, or may implement their own hedging programs. As a result, we generally do not hedge an investment portfolio's exposure to non-U.S. currency.

We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk. Assuming 11% of our AUM are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangement, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our AUM by approximately $1.9 billion, which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately $10.1 million at our weighted-average fee rate for the business of 52 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. On March 27, 2020, the Company executed the Swap, a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction, to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. On February 18, 2021, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap to update LIBOR

conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October
6, 2022. On October 30, 2023, the Company monetized the gain on the Swap and entered into an agreement to terminate the Swap, which was effective
on October 30, 2023. Refer to Note 14, Derivatives, for further information on the Swap. At September 30, 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk as
a result of the amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement, as amended. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for a description of the amounts outstanding
as of such date and the applicable interest rate.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) at September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
