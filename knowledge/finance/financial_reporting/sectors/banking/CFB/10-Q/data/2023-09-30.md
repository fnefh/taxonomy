## Forward-Looking Information

All statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute forward-looking statements. Th ese statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "might," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "projection," "goal," "target," "outlook," "aim," "would," "annualized," "position" and "outlook," or the negative of these words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. For example, our forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business plans, expectations, or opportunities for growth; the impact of the acquisition of Canyon Bancorporation, Inc. and Canyon Community Bank, N.A. (collectively "Canyon"); our expense management initiatives and the results expected to be realized from those initiatives; our anticipated financial results, expenses,cash requirements and sources of liquidity; and our capital allocation strategies and plans.

Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Form 10-Qto "we," "our," "us," and the "Company" refer to CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. References in this Form 10-Q to "CrossFirst Bank" and the "Bank" refer to CrossFirst Bank, our wholly owned consolidated bank subsidiary.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not a guaranteeof future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation: impacts on us and our clients of a decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses thereto, including uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets; interest rate fluctuations; our ability to effectively execute our growth strategy and manage our growth, including identifying and consummating suitable mergers and acquisitions, entering new lines of business or offering new or enhanced services or products; our ability to successfully integrate Canyon; fluctuations in fair value of our investments due to factors outside of our control; our ability to successfullymanage credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance; geographic concentration of our markets; economic impact on our commercial real estate and commercial-based loan portfolios, including declines in commercial and residential real estate values; an increase in non-performing assets; our ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel; maintaining and increasing customer deposits, funding availability, liquidity and our ability to raise and maintain sufficient capital; competition from banks, credit unions and other financial services providers; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; accounting estimates; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; cyber incidents or other failures, disruptions or security breaches; employee error, fraud committed against the Company or our clients, or incomplete or inaccurate information about clients and counterparties; mortgage markets; our ability to maintain our reputation; costs and effects of litigation; environmental liability; risk exposure from transactions with financial counterparties; severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics; acts of war or terrorism or other external events; changes in laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or policies relating to financial institutions, including stringent capital requirements, higher FDIC insurance premiums and assessments, consumer protection laws and privacy laws; volatility in our stock price; or risks inherent with proposed business acquisitions and the failure to achieve projected synergies. Additional discussion of these and other risk factors can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 ("2022 Form 10-K"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 3, 2023, and in our other filings with the SEC.

Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in our business,results of operations or financial condition over time. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

## Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Organization and Nature of

Operations

CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. (the "Company") is a bank holding company whose principal activities are the ownership and management of its wholly-owned subsidiary, CrossFirst Bank (the "Bank"). In addition, the Bank has three subsidiaries including CrossFirst Investments, Inc. ("CFI"), which holds investments in marketable securities, CFBSA I, LLC and CFBSA II, LLC.

The Bank is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and financial servicesto individual and corporate customers through its full-service branches in: (i) Leawood, Kansas; (ii) Wichita, Kansas; (iii) Kansas City,Missouri; (iv) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; (v) Tulsa, Oklahoma; (vi) Dallas, Texas; (vii) Fort Worth, Texas; (viii) Frisco, Texas; (ix) Phoenix, Arizona; (x) Colorado Springs, Colorado; (xi) Denver, Colorado; (xii) Clayton, New Mexico; and (xiii) Tucson, Arizona.

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements serve to update the CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and include the accounts of the Company,the Bank, CFI, CFBSA I, LLC and CFBSA II, LLC. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and where applicable, with general practices in the banking industry or guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory agencies. However, they may not include all informationand notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements under GAAP applicable to annual periods and accordingly should be readin conjunction with the financial information contained in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts are made whenever necessary to conform to current period presentation. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. All amounts are in thousands, except share data, or as otherwise noted.

GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, estimates are based on judgment and available information. Management has made significant estimates in certain areas, such as the fair values of financial instruments,and the allowance for credit losses ("ACL"). Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with any estimation process and future changes in market and economic conditions, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

The Company's significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December31, 2022 and are contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for that period.There have been no significant changes to the application of significant accounting policies since December 31, 2022 .

## Related Party

Transactions

The Bank extends credit and receives deposits from related parties. In management's opinion, the loans and deposits were made in the ordinary course of business and made on similar terms as those prevailing at the timewith other persons. Related party loans totaled $ 10 million and $ 13 million while related party deposits totaled $ 99 million and $ 92 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,

respectively.

## Note 2: Acquisition Activities

On August 1, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Canyon Bancorporation, Inc. and Canyon Community Bank, N.A. (collectively, "Canyon") whereby Canyon Bancorporation, Inc. was ultimately merged with and into CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. and Canyon Community Bank, N.A. was merged with and into CrossFirst Bank (the"Tucson acquisition"). Pursuant to the merger agreement executed in April 2023, the Company paid approximately $ 9.1 million of cash consideration and issued 597,645 shares of Company common stock, and the Company and the Bank assumed all of the assets and liabilities of the Canyon entities with which they merged by operation of law. The acquisition added one full-service branch within Arizona to the Company'sfootprint thereby deepening our Arizona franchise.

Tucson acquisition-related costs totaled $ 2.2 million and $ 2.3 million for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, including a Day 1 CECL provision expense of $ 0.9 million. Acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Farmers & Stockmens Bank (the "Colorado/New Mexico acquisition") totaled $ 1.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. Acquisition-related costs were included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The results of both acquisitions mentioned above are included in the results of the Company subsequent to the acquisition dates and reported in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

The Company determined that the Tucson acquisition constitutes a business combination as defined in Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, as of the date of the acquisition, the Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. The Company determined fair valuesin accordance with the guidance provided in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In many cases, the determination of these fair values required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions andother future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. Actual results could differ materially. The Company has made the determination of fair values using the best information available at the time; however, purchase accounting is not complete and the assumptions used are subject to change and, if changed, could have a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

The table below summarizes preliminary net assets acquired (at fair value) and consideration transferred in connection with the Tucson acquisition:

| Goodwill | $ 1,299 |

In connection with the Tucson acquisition, the Company recorded $ 1.3 million of goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded reflects the expanded market presence, synergies and operational efficiencies that are expected to result from the acquisition. The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above:

Cash and cash equivalents -The carrying amount of these assets was deemed a reasonable estimate of fair value basedon the short-term nature of these assets.

Loans, net -The fair value of loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology. Inputs and assumptionsused in the fair value estimate of the loan portfolio, includes interest rate, servicing, credit and liquidity risk, and required equity return. The fair value of loans was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the remaining maturity and repricing terms. Cash flows were adjusted by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans.

Core deposit intangibles -The Company identified customer relationships, in the form of core deposit intangibles, as an identified intangible asset. Core deposit intangibles derive value from the expected future benefits or earnings capacity attributable to the acquired core deposits. The core deposit intangible was valued by identifying the expected future benefits ofthe core deposits and discounting those benefits back to present value. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately 10 years using the sum of the years' digits accelerated method.

Deposits -By definition, the fair value of demand and saving deposits equals the amount payable. For time deposits acquired, the Company utilized an income approach, discounting the contractual cash flows on the instruments over their remaining contractual lives at prevailing market rates.

The fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities noted in the table may change during theprovisional period, which may last up to twelve months subsequent to the acquisition date. The Company may obtain additional information to refinethe valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities and adjust the recorded fair value.

## Accounting for acquired loans

Loans acquired are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Purchasedcredit deteriorated loans ("PCD") are loans that have experienced more than insignificantcredit deterioration since origination and are recorded at the purchase price. Management determined that past due loans, adversely riskrated, on non-accrual or considered a troubled-debt restructured loan constituted insignificant credit deterioration. The sum of the loan's purchase price and the allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortizedcost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan.

Non-PCD loans have not experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The difference between the fair value and outstanding balance of the non-PCD loans is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the lives of the loan.

A Day 1 CECL allowance for credit losses on the non-PCD loans was recorded through provision for credit loss expense within the consolidated statements of operations. At the date of acquisition, of the $ 105.7 million of loans acquired from Canyon, $ 26.0 million, or 25% of Canyon's loan portfolio, were accounted for as PCD loans.

The following table provides a summary of PCD loans purchased as part of the Tucson acquisition as of the acquisition date:

Based on the Company's evaluation at each respective period end, we recorded no credit loss impairment during the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses in the Company's investment portfolio were caused by interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2023 the Company does not intend to sell the investments in loss positions,and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

## Equity Securities

Equity securities consist of $ 5 million of private equity investments and $ 4 million of restricted equity securities. The private equity investments are included in "other" assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

The Company elected a measurement alternative for its private equity investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value and did not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value using the net asset value per share. A cost basis was calculated for the equity investments. The recorded balance will adjust for any impairment or any observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. No such events occurred during the three- or nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

The following is a summary of the unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity securitiesrecognized in net income:

The Company aggregates the loan portfolio by similar credit risk characteristics. Effective with the second quarter of 2023, we revised the reported loan segments to better reflect how management monitors the portfolio, assesses credit risk and evaluates the ACL. All prior period disclosures have been revised to reflect the changes to the loan segments. The loan segments are described in additional detail below:

- ● Commercial and Industrial - The category includes loans and lines of credit to commercial and industrial clients for usein property, plant, and equipment purchases, business operations, expansions and for working capital needs. Loan terms typically require amortizing payments that decrease the outstanding loan balance while the lines of credit typically require interest-only payments with maturities ranging from one- to three-years. Lines of credit allow the borrower to draw down and repay the line of credit based on the client's cash flow needs. Repayment is primarily from the cash flow of a borrower's principal business operation. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions.
- ● Energy - The category includes loans to oil and natural gas customers for use in financingworking capital needs, exploration and production activities, and acquisitions. The loans are repaid primarily from the conversion of crude oil and natural gas to cash. Credit risk is drivenby creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Energy loans are typically collateralized with the underlying oil and gas reserves.
- ● Commercial Real Estate - OwnerOccupied - The category includes relationships where we are usually the primary provider of financialservices for the company and/or the principals and the primary source of repayment is through the cash flows generated by the borrowers' business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are typically secured by a first lien mortgage on real property plus assignmentsof all leases related to the properties. Credit risk may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.
- ● Commercial Real Estate - Non-OwnerOccupied - The category includes loans that typically involve larger principal amounts and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the leasing income generated from tenants. These are viewed primarily as cashflow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.

## Table of Contents

Additionally, the category includes construction and land development loans that are based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project. Independent appraisals and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners are completed. Sources of repayment include secondary market

permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes,general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing.

Credit risk for non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be impactedby the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.

The category also includes loans that are secured by multifamily properties.Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on occupancy rates and rental income.

- ● Residential Real Estate - The category includes loans that are generally secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. We also offer open- and closed-ended home equity loans, which are loans generally secured by second lien positions on residential real estate. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within or outside the borrower's market areas that might impact either property values or a borrower's personal income.
- ● Consumer - The category includes personal lines of credit and various term loans such as automobile loans and loans for other personal purposes. Repayment is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Creditrisk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the borrower's market area) and the creditworthiness of a borrower.

## Allowance for Credit

Losses

The Company's CECL committee meets at least quarterly to oversee the ACL methodology. The committee estimates the ACLusing relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ACL represents the Company's current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date. The ACL is adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate and excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.

The ACL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.

Asset Specific -When unique qualities cause a loan's exposure to loss to be inconsistent with the pooled reserves, the loan is individually evaluated.Individual reserves are calculated for loans that are risk-rated substandard and on non-accrual and loans that are risk-rated doubtful or loss that are greater than a defined dollar threshold. Reserves on asset specific loans may be based on collateral, for collateral-dependent loans, or on quantitativeand qualitative factors, including expected cash flow, market sentiment, and guarantor support.

Quantitative - The Company used the cohort method, which identifies and captures the balance of a pool of loanswith similar risk characteristics as of a particular time to form a cohort. The cohort is then tracked for losses over the remaining life of loans or until the poolis exhausted. The Company used a lookback period of approximately six-years to establish the cohort population. By using the historical data timeframe, the Company can establish a historical loss factor for each of its loan segments.

## Table of Contents

Qualitative - The Company uses qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss factors for current conditions. TheCompany primarily uses the following qualitative factors:

◾ ◾ ◾ ◾ ◾ ◾ ◾ ◾ ◾

The nature and volume of changes in risk

ratings; The volume and severity of past due loans;

The volume of non-accrual loans;

- The nature and volume of the loan portfolio, including the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of
- credit; Changes in the Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Manager Indices ("PMI") for services and
- manufacturing; Changes in collateral values;
- Changes in lending policies, procedures, and quality of loan
- reviews; Changes in lending staff; and
- Changes in competition, legal and regulatory

environments

In addition to the current condition qualitative adjustments, the Company uses the Federal Reserve's unemployment forecast to adjust the ACL based on forward looking guidance. The Federal Reserve's unemployment forecast extends three-years and is eventually reverted to the mean of six percent by year 10.

## Internal Credit Risk

## Ratings

The Company uses a weighted average risk rating factor to adjust the historicalloss factors for current events. Risk ratings incorporate the criteria utilized by regulatory authorities to describe criticized assets, but separate various levels of risk concentrated within the regulatory "Pass" category. Risk ratings are established for loans at origination and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The rating assigned to a loan reflects the risks posed by the borrower's expected performance and the transaction's structure. Performance metrics used to determine a risk rating include, but are not limited to, cash flow adequacy, liquidity, and collateral. A description of the loan risk ratings follows:

## Loan Grades

- ● Pass (risk rating 1-4) - The category includes loans that are considered satisfactory. The category includes borrowers that generally maintaingood liquidity and financial condition, or the credit is currently protected with sales trends remaining flat or declining. Most ratios compare favorably with industry norms and Company policies. Debt is programmed and timely repayment is
- ● Special Mention (risk rating 5) - The category includes borrowers that generally exhibit adverse trends in operations or an imbalancedposition in their balance sheet that has not reached a point where repayment is jeopardized. Credits are currently protected but, if left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or in the Company's credit or lien position at a future date. These credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to enough risk to warrant adverse classification.

expected.

- ● Substandard (risk rating 6) - The category includes borrowers that generally exhibit well-defined weakness(es) that jeopardizerepayment. Credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. A distinct possibility exists that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets

classified substandard. Substandard loans include both performing and non-performing loans andare broken out in the table below.

- ● Doubtful (risk rating 7) - The category includes borrowers that exhibit weaknesses inherent in a substandard credit and characteristics that these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based on existing facts, conditions, and values. Because of reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the assets, classification as a loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

- ● Loss (risk rating 8) - Credits that are considered uncollectible or of such little value that their continuance as a bankableasset is not warranted.

## Non-accrual Loan Analysis

Non-accrual loans are loans for which the Company does not record interest income. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date, if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Loans are returnedto accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. The following tables present the Company's non-accrual loans by loan segments at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("TDR") and requires an entity evaluate whether loan modifications represent a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Such troubled debt modifications ("TDM") may include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant-payment delays, term extensions or any combination thereof. The Company adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis.

During the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company modified four and seven loans, respectively, with an amortized cost basis at September 30, 2023 of $ 9.2 million to facilitate repayment that are considered TDMs. The following table presents, by loan segment, the amortized cost basis as of the date shown for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty:

Table of Contents

| | September 30, 2023 Term Extension | September 30, 2023 Term Extension | September 30, 2023 Term Extension | September 30, 2023 Term Extension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Amortized Cost % of Loan Class | Amortized Cost % of Loan Class | Amortized Cost % of Loan Class | Amortized Cost % of Loan Class |
| Commercial and industrial | $ | 4,674 | 0. 2 % | 0. 2 % |
| Commercial real estate - owner- | | 4,569 | | |
| occupied Total Loans | $ | 9,243 | | 1.0 |

The following schedule presents the payment status by loan class, as of September 30, 2023, of the amortized cost basis of loans that have been modified since January 1, 2023:

| | September 30, 2023 Current (Dollars in thousands) |
| --- | --- |
| Commercial and industrial | $ 4,674 |
| Commercial real estate - owner- | 4,569 |
| occupied Total Loans | $ 9,243 |

The Company had no TDMs that were modified and had defaulted on their modified terms during the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. For purposes of this disclosure, the Company considers "default" to mean 90 days or more past due on principal or interest. The allowance for credit losses related to TDMs on non-accrual status is determined by individual evaluation,

including collateral adequacy, using the same process as loans on non-accrual status which are not classified as TDMs.

The following schedule presents the financial effect of the modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of September 30, 2023:

| | September 30, 2023 Financial Effect Term Extension | September 30, 2023 Financial Effect Term Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial and industrial | Added a weighted average monthly payment amounts | 1.2 years to the life of loan, which reduced |
| Commercial real estate - owner- occupied | Added a weighted average monthly payment amounts | 0.5 years to the life of loan, which reduced |

Troubled Debt Restructurings

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, TDRs were extended to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty andwho had been granted a concession, excluding loan modifications as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The modification of terms typically included the extension of maturity, reduction or deferment of monthly payment, or reduction of the stated interest rate.

The outstanding balance of TDRs recognized prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 was $ September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

28.1 million and $ 30.5 million as of

The Company estimates expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision (release) for credit loss expense.

The estimate is calculated for each loan segment and includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of the expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. For each pool of contractual obligations expected to be funded, the Company uses the reserve rate established for the relatedloan pools. The $ 6 million and $ 9 million allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are included in "interest payable and other liabilities" on the statements of financial condition.

The following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:

Loan commitments - include revolving lines of credit, non-revolving lines of credit, and loans approved that are not yet funded. Risks inherent to revolving lines of credit often are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. The primary risk associatedwith non-revolving lines of credit is the diversion of funds for other expenditures.

Letters of credit - are primarily established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and applicant. If the obligation is not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.

## Note 5: Leases

The Company's leases primarily include bank branches located in Kansas City, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Texas; Frisco, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The remaining lease terms on these branch leases range from less than one year to eighteen years with certain options to renew. Renewal terms can extend the lease term between five years and twenty years . The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in the estimatedvalue of the right of use ("ROU") asset and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recognized one finance lease and the remaining Company leases are classified as operating leases.

The ROU asset is included in "other assets" on the consolidated statements of financialcondition, and was $ 28 million and $ 31 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The lease liability is located in "Interest payable and other liabilities" on the consolidated statements of financial condition and was $ 31 million and $ 34 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

As of September 30, 2023, the remaining weighted-average lease term is 11.2 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 2.56% utilizing the Company's incremental Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowing rate for borrowings of a similar term at the date of lease commencement.

## Note 6: Goodwill and Core Deposit

## Intangible

In connection with the Tucson acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $ 1.3 million during the three-months ended September 30, 2023. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs annual tests to identify impairment of goodwill and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. No goodwill impairment was recorded during the nine-months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company recorded a core deposit intangible ("CDI") of $ 4.5 million during the three-months ended September 30, 2023, as part of the Tucson acquisition. The Company is amortizing the CDI from the Colorado/New Mexico acquisitionand the Tucson acquisition over their estimated useful lives of approximately 10 years using the sum of the years' digits accelerated method. The Company recognized core deposit intangible amortization expense of $ 0.9 million and $ 2.5 million for the three- and ninemonth periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

## Note 7: Derivatives and Hedging

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk managementactivities to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of futureknown and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.

## Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company uses interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest income and expenseand to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest ratesfall below the floor strike rate on the contract. During 2023, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt and loan assets. Previously, five swaps that were entered into in 2021 were terminated during the third quarter of 2022; however, the amortization of the gains on these instruments began in 2023 based on the original effective dates of these swaps. Derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges include five instruments with a notional amount of $ 340 million and one instrument with a notional amount of $250 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gainor loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into interest income or expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income and expense as interest payments are received and made on the Company's variable-rate assets and debt. The Company currently estimates that $ 2.7 million will be reclassified as a decrease to net interest income during the next twelve months.

The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecastedtransactions over a maximum period of 5.6 years.

## Non-designated Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service provided to clients. The Company executes interest rate swaps with customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third-party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements and changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.

Swap fees earned upon origination and credit valuation adjustments that represent the risk of a counterparty's default are reported on the statements of operations as swap fee income, net. The effect of the Company's derivative financial instruments gain (loss) is reported on the statements of cash flows within "other assets" and "other liabilities".

These 44 and 49 swaps had an aggregate notional amount of $ 350 million and $ 421 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

## Note 10: Regulatory

## Matters

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The capital rules require the Company to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer with respect to Common Equity Tier I capital, Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and total capital to risk-weighted assets, which is included in the column "Required to be Considered Adequately Capitalized" within the table below. Afinancial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, as well as certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

The Company and the Bank opted to exclude AOCI from the regulatory capital calculations. As a result, changes in AOCI, net of tax, do not impact the Company's or Bank's regulatory capital ratios.

The Company's and the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are presented in the following table:

## Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

The Company awards performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") to key officers of the Company. The PBRSUs typically cliff-vest at the end of three years based on attainment of certain performance metrics developed by the Compensation Committee. The ultimate number of shares issuable under each performance award is the product of the award target and the award payout percentage given the level of achievement. The award payout percentages by level of achievement range between 0% of target and 150% of target.

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted include three-year cumulative earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.

The following table summarizes the status of and changes in the PBRSUs:

128,005 PBRSUs. The performance metrics

## Note 14: Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial

## Instruments

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or

liabilities.

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroboratedby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or

liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

## Recurring Measurements

The following list presents the assets and liabilities recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair valuehierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Valuation

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Available-for- Sale Securities | Description Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss | Level 2 | Found Note 3: Securities |

sale

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. Collateral-Dependent Loans, Net of ACL

The estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. If the fair value of the collateral is below the loan's amortized cost, the ACL is netted against the loan balance. Collateraldependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral dependent loans are

obtained when the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and subsequently as deemednecessary by the Office of the Chief Credit Officer.

Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and consistency by management. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimatesare developed by the Office of the Chief Credit Officer by comparison to historical

results.

## Foreclosed Assets Held-for-

Sale

The fair value of foreclosed assets-held-for-sale is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell.

## Non-GAAP Financial

## Measures

In addition to disclosing financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company discloses certainnonGAAP financial measures including "tangible common stockholders'equity," "tangible book value per common share," "adjusted efficiency ratio - FTE," "adjusted net income," "adjusted earnings per common share - diluted," "adjusted return on average assets," and "adjusted return on average common equity." We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful inevaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or gains that we believeare not indicative of our primary business operating results. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented inaccordance with GAAP and you should not rely on nonGAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from non-GAAP financial measuresused by our peers or other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that bothmeasures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures follows.

## Overview

Net income totaled $16.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, for the three-monthsended September, 30, 2023 compared to $17.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, during the three-months ended September 30, 2022. For the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2023 and 2022, net income totaled $49.0 million, or $0.99per diluted common share, and $49.7 million, or $0.99 per diluted common share, respectively. For both comparative periods, increases in net interest income and non-interest income were more than offset by higher non-interest expense.

The third quarter of 2023 included acquisition-related charges of $1.3 million and Day 1 CECL provision expense on acquired loans of $0.9 million, resulting in adjusted net income $^{(1)}$ of $18.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share on an adjusted basis $^{(1)}$. The nine-months ended September 30, 2023 included acquisition-related charges of $3.1 million, Day 1 CECL provision expense on acquired loans of $0.9 million and employee separation costs of $1.3 million resulting in adjusted net income $^{(1)}$ of $53.2 million, or $1.08 per diluted common share, on an adjusted basis $^{(1)}$.

Return on average assets was 0.94% and 0.95% for the three- and nine-months endedSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted return on average assets $^{(1)}$ was 1.04% and 1.03% for the same periods. Return on average common equity was 10.19% and 10.24% for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted return on average common equity $^{(1)}$ was 11.26% and 11.12% for the same periods.

## Net Interest Income

Net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis. We believe reporting on an FTE basis provides for improved comparability between the various earning assets. Changes in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates.

The following tables present, for the periods indicated, average statement of financial condition information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yield and rates paid:

Net interest income -Net interest income increased $5.4 million and $28.4 million and net interest income - FTE increased $5.3 million and $28.2 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022, respectively. Compared to the third quarter of 2022, net interest margin - FTE for the third quarter of 2023 decreased 37 basis points. For the ninemonths ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, net interestmargin - FTE decreased 10 basis points.

Average earning assets totaled $7.0 billion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 and $6.8 billion for the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increases of $1.3 billion for both periods, compared to the same periods in 2022, inclusive of the impact of the acquisition of Farmers & Stockmens Bank (the "Colorado/New Mexico acquisition") and the Tucson acquisition. The increases were driven by higher average loan and investment portfolio balances, partiallyoffset by lower average cash balances for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the corresponding periodsin 2022.

The FTE yield on earning assets increased 1.79% from the third quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023 and increased 2.21% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022 due to new loan productionas well as repricing of variable rate loans, partially offset by the impact of non-accrual loan interest reversals. The cost of funds increased 2.37% and 2.51% over the same periods due to pricing pressure on interest-bearing deposits from the higher interest rate environment as well as client migration into higher cost deposit products compared to the prior

year.

The Company currently anticipates net interest margin - FTE to be in a range of 3.20% to 3.25% for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Provision expense of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 was consistent with the same period in 2022. For the ninemonths ended September 30, 2023 provision expense of $10.4 million increased $5.5 million compared to the same period in 2022. Increases due to loan growth, changes in credit quality, economic factors, an increase in specific reserves and $0.9 million of Day 1 CECL provision expense related to the Tucson acquisition were partially offset by a decrease relatedto the decrease in unfunded commitments.

The changes in non-interest income were driven primarily by the following:

Service charges and fees on customer accounts - The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the corresponding periods in 2022 were driven primarily by increases in accountanalysis fees due to increased client volume from new markets and acquired accounts as well as various fee increases on commercial accounts.

ATM and credit card interchange income - The increase in ATM and credit card interchange income for the three-months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three-months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in ATM fee income due to higher transaction volume. The decrease in ATM and credit card interchange income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was driven primarily by a decrease in creditcard fees due to one large customer with pandemicrelated activity that did not occur in the current year, partially offset by increases in ATM fee income.

Gain on sale of loans - The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods for 2022 were due to mortgage and SBA loan sale activity in 2023.Our SBA lending team is a specialty lending vertical we augmented from the Colorado/New Mexico acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Other non-interest income - The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods for 2022 were due to stronger client-related transactional income and an increasein gains on equity securities. Non-Interest Expense

Non-interest expense increased $7.9 million and $26.5 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The third quarter of 2023 included $1.3 million of acquisition-related expenses, with $0.8 million included in professional fees, $0.3 million in salaries and employee benefits, $0.1 million in software and communication, and $0.1 million in other non-interest expense. The nine-months ended September 30, 2023 included $3.1 million of acquisitionrelated expenses, most of which were included in professional fees and salaries and employee benefits, and $1.3 million of employee separation costs included in salaries and employee benefits. The three-month period ended September 30, 2022 included $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses, most of which were included in professional fees. The nine-months ended September 30, 2022 included $0.3 million of acquisition-related expenses, most of which were included in professional fees, and $1.1 million of employee separation costs included in other non-interest expense. The changes in non-interest expense were driven primarily by the following:

Salary and Employee Benefits - For both the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, excluding the employee separation costs in 2023 previously mentioned, increases were primarily due to the addition of employees from the Colorado/New Mexico acquisition and the Tucson acquisition, hiring in new markets and merit increases.

Occupancy - For both comparative periods, the increases in occupancy costs were driven by the addition of a second location in Dallas, Texas as well as the additional occupancy cost from acquired locations in Colorado, New Mexico and Tucson.

Professional Fees - Professional fees for both the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 were consistent with the prior year periods after adjusting for the acquisition related costs.

Deposit Insurance Premiums - The increase in deposit insurance premiums was due to an increase in the assessment rate and increases in assets for both comparative periods.

Software and communication - For both the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, increases in software and communications were due to technology for additional employees and clients as well as new technology implementation.

Other Non-interest Expense - For the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year, the decrease for employee separation costs was partially offset by increased post-pandemic travel expenses and transaction fraudrelated losses.

Core Deposit Intangible Amortization - For both the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, increases were due to expense related to the Colorado/New Mexico acquisition and the Tucson acquisition.

We currently anticipate non-interest expense to be in a range of $34 to $35 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratios were 59.49% and 60.77% and the adjusted efficiency ratios FTE $^{(1)}$ were 55.17% and 56.28% for the three- and ninemonth periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

rate

Our income tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using thefederal statutory tax rate, primarily from investments in tax advantaged assets, including bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt municipal securities; state tax credits; and permanent tax differences from stock-based compensation.

The Company's effective tax rate benefited from tax-exempt interest in both the three-and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. However, the impact of tax-exempt interest on the overall tax rate is lower in 2023 as its proportion to total income was lower as compared to 2022. We currently anticipate the Company'seffective tax rate to remain within the 20% to 22% range in the near term.

## Analysis of Financial Condition

Total assets were $7.2 billion at September 30, 2023 compared to $6.6billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 9%, including $0.2 billion as a result of the Tucson acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $67 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2022, and investment securities increased $64 million, or 9%. Loans increased $0.6 billion, or 11%, including $0.1 billion as a result of the Tucson acquisition, and the allowance for credit losses increased $10 million to $72 million at September 30, 2023. Total deposits increased $0.7 billion to $6.3 billion at September 30, 2023, compared to December 31,2022, including $0.2 billion as a result of the Tucson acquisition. Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances totaled $89 million and decreased $130 million compared to December 31, 2022.

## Investment Portfolio

The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to ensure adequate liquidity, includingserving as a contingent, onbalance sheet source of liquidity. In addition, we manage the portfolio in a manner that optimizes earnings, managescredit and interest rate risk,

and meets pledging and regulatory capital requirements. Our portfolio is 100%available-for-sale and as of September 30, 2023 totaled $750 million, an increase of $64 million from December 31, 2022.

The increase in the investment portfolio was driven by the purchase of $107 million in SBA securities, $45 million in mortgagebacked securities, $15 million in U.S. Treasury securities, and $12 million in tax-exempt municipal securities. The increase was partially offset by an increase of $37 million in the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. Additional offsets include the sale of $67 million in tax-exempt municipal securities at a modest gain and $14 million of paydowns and maturities in mortgagebacked securities as we intentionally improved the liquidity of the portfolio during the year, consistent with our current investment strategy. Our future investment strategy includes reducing the concentration in municipal investments, investing in lower risk-weighted assets and restructuring the portfolio to increase liquidity and provide more balanced cash flow.

## Charge-offs and Recoveries

Net charge-offs were $1.3 million and $3.5 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, charge-offs were primarily due to one commercial and industrial loan that was previously reserved. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, there were charge-offs of three additional commercial and industrial loans. The below table provides the ratio of net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding based on our loan categories for the periods indicated:

## Non-performing Assets and Other Asset Quality Metrics

Non-performing assets include: (i) non-performing loans, which includes non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and loans modified prior to January 1, 2023 under TDRs that are not performing in accordance with their modified terms;(ii) foreclosed assets held for sale; (iii) repossessed assets; and (iv) impaired debt

## securities.

Non-performing assets increased $22.8 million during the quarter to $36.1 million at September 30, 2023 primarily due to one commercial and industrialcredit and one commercial real estate - non-owner-occupied credit moving to non-accrual and several credits that were 90+ days past due and still accruing at quarter-end. The nonperforming assets to total assets ratio increased from 0.31% at September 30, 2022 to 0.50%at September 30, 2023. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.09% for the quarter compared to 0.04% in the prior quarter and 0.16% in the prior year third quarter. With respect to one commercial and industrial creditwith a $13.6 million balance that was over 90 days past due, the borrower raised new equity capital and brought the credit current after quarter end, reducing our non-performing assets to total assets ratio to 0.31%.

The Company continues to monitor the U.S. economic indicators, including the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, commodity prices, interest rates, and potential supply chain disruptions and the impact they may have on the Company's markets, clients, and prospects. The Company is monitoring the impact of a rising interest rate environment on the commercial real estate market and enterprise and leverage loans that is currently partially mitigated by low debt-to-equity ratios. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not identify any systemic issues within its loan portfolio that wouldmaterially affect the credit quality of the loan portfolio. However, there could be some risk rating migration in certain sectors of the commercial real estate portfolio in the future as many projects arefaced with higher interest rates, operating costs, and property taxes.

Deposits and Other Borrowings

At September 30, 2023, our deposits totaled $6.3 billion, an increase of $680 million or 12% from December 31, 2022. The increase included a $798 million increase in time deposits and $253 million in money market, NOW and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $371 million in non-interest-bearing deposits. The increases in deposits include $165 million related to the Tucson acquisition. Approximately 45% of the time deposit increase was from new client money and shifts from other deposit categories with the remainder representing an increase in wholesale funding. The decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to elevated deposits at year-end that were deployed by clients late in the first quarter of 2023.

The following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits as of September 30, 2023:

| Total | $ 498,494 | $ 619,902 | $ 493,691 | $ 131,566 | $ 1,743,653 |

Other borrowings include FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, a line of credit, SBA loan secured borrowings, and our trust preferred security. At September 30, 2023, other borrowings totaled $107 million, a $147 million, or 58% decrease from December 31, 2022. Borrowings were reduced due to client deposit growth and acquired deposit balances. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, $31 million of FHLB advances matured and were converted into a drawdown on the FHLB line of credit, an additional $12 million matured and $12 million of net FHLB advances were paid off. With respect to the FHLB line of credit, the Company paid down the converted $31 million of FHLB advances and an additional $75 million, net, resulting in a zero balance on the FHLB line of credit as of September30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $2.4 billion of uninsured deposits, which is an estimated amount based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. Excluding pass-thru accounts where clients have deposit insurance at the correspondent financial institution, our uninsured deposits are $2.1 billion, or 33% of total deposits as of September 30, 2023. The average client account balance as of September 30, 2023 is less than $250 thousand for both individual accounts and business accounts in total after excluding pass-through and insured cash sweep deposits.We have geographic and industry diversity within our deposit base as the majority of our deposits are located in our footprint states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, and Colorado. The Company believes that its current capital ratios and liquidity are sufficient to mitigate the risks of uninsured deposits.

## Liquidity and Capital

Resources Liquidity

We manage our liquidity based upon factors that include the level and quality of capital andour overall financial condition, the trend and volume of problem assets, our balance sheet risk exposure, the level of deposits as a percentage of total loans, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources and off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securitieswe hold, and other factors. We also conduct contingency funding plan stress tests at least annually to assess potential liquidityoutflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed potentially problematic by management. The Company's liquidity strategy is to maintain adequate, but not excessive, liquidity to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients while attempting to achieve adequate earnings for stockholders. The Company measures liquidity needs through daily balance sheet monitoring, weekly cash projections and monthly liquidity measures reviewed in conjunction with Boardapproved liquidity policy limits. The Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of proceeds from prepaying and maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio, increases in client deposits and wholesale deposits. Liquidity resources can be derived from two sources: (i) on-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds currently on the statement of financial condition and (ii) off-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds available from third-party sources. The Company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity resources consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:

Table of Contents

| | September 30, | December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 (Dollars in thousands) |
| Total on-balance sheet | 983,678 | $ 986,482 |
| liquidity Total off-balance sheet | 1,435,631 | 770,165 |
| liquidity Total liquidity | 2,419,309 | $ 1,756,647 |
| On-balance sheet liquidity as a percent of | 14 % | 15 % |
| assets Total liquidity as a percent of assets | 34 % | 27 % |

Off-balance sheet liquidity increased from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in available funding with FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank.

For the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased $67 million from December 31, 2022 to $233 million, representing 3% of total assets. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company increased the available-for-sale securities portfolio on an amortized cost basis by $101 million,net of paydowns, maturities, and amortization. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $332 million in securities that could be pledged and $46 million that could be sold at a net gain based on market conditions at the time. In addition, the Company increasedfunded loans by $471 million, net of payoffs and charge-offs during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 that reduced cash and cash equivalents.

The Company's time deposits increased by $780 million primarily from wholesale funding, new client money and shifts from other deposit categories. Savings and money market deposits increased by $253 million. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $371 million as elevated year-end balances were deployed by clients in the first quarter of 2023 in addition to clients migrating into interestbearing deposits. FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased $147 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, largely related to a reduction in FHLB advances due to client deposit growth and acquired deposit balances.

The Company did not purchase any common stock during the first nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2023,$16 million remains available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. The amount and timing ofsuch future share repurchases will be dependent on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, overall capital levels and cash flow needs. There is no assurance that we will repurchase up to the full amount remaining under our program.

Dividends of $258 thousand related to the Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock were declared and paid by the Company during the nine-months ended September, 2023. In October 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in the amount of $20.00 per share to be payable on December 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of November 30, 2023.

The Company believes that its current on and off-balance sheet liquidity will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter. The Company believes that it has several on and off-balance sheetoptions to address reductions in cash and cash equivalents in order to maintain appropriate liquidity.

## Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet

## Arrangements

The Company is subject to contractual obligations made in the ordinary course of business. The obligations include deposit liabilities, other borrowed funds, and operating leases. Refer to "Note 8: Time Deposits and Other Borrowings" and "Note 5: Leases" within the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for information regarding the Company's significant contractual cash obligations and contractual obligations to third parties on lease obligations, respectively.

As a financial services provider, the Company is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit. Off-balance sheet arrangements represent the Company's future cash requirements. However, a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Refer to "Note 15: Commitments and Credit Risk" within the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for a listing of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements.

The Company's short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations, may be satisfied through the Company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity discussed above.

## Capital Requirements

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. The regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities, select off-balance sheet items and equity. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to "Note 10: Regulatory Matters" in the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for additional information. Management believes that as of September 30, 2023, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for management judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readilyavailable from independent, objective sources. The Company evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

A discussion of these policies can be found in the section captioned "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company's application of critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2022.

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

A primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Interest rate risk management is a key element of the Company 's statement of financial condition management. Interest rate risk is the risk that net interestmargins will erode over time due to changing market conditions. Many factors can cause margins to erode: (i) lower loan demand; (ii) increasedcompetition for funds; (iii) weak pricing policies; (iv) statement of financial condition mismatches; and (v) changing liquidity demands. The objective is to maximize income while minimizing interest rate risk. The Company manages its sensitivity positionusing its interest rate risk policy. The management of interest rate risk is a three-step process and involves: (i) measuring the interest rate risk position; (ii) policy constraints; and (iii) strategic review and implementation.

Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO"). The ALCO uses a combination of three systems to measure the statement of financial condition's interest rate risk position. The three systems in combination are expected to provide a better overall result than a single system alone. The three systems include: (i) gap reports;(ii) earnings simulation; and (iii) economic value of equity. The ALCO's primary tools to change the interest rate risk position are:(i) investment portfolio duration; (ii) deposit and borrowing mix; and (iii) on-balance sheet derivatives.

The ALCO evaluates interest rate risk using a rate shock method and rate ramp method. In a rate shock analysis, rates change immediately, and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate ramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. Management reviews and utilizes both methods in managing interest rate risk; however, both methods represent a risk indicator, not a forecast. The following tables summarize the simulated changes in net interest income and fair value of equityover a 12-month horizon using a rate shock and rate ramp method as of the dates indicated:

## Table of Contents

The Company's position is relatively neutral as of September 30, 2023, which is less sensitive as compared to both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 due to deposit mix changes with demand deposits as the main driver. Compared to December 31, 2022, the Company's position is less asset sensitive due to the reduction in demand deposits and an on-balance sheet interestrate collar that becomes effective in the first quarter of 2024. The aggregate beta assumption utilized as of September 30, 2023 was approximately 60% which is unchanged from our previous assumption. Other key assumptions updated during 2023 include updated deposit decay rates, new business spreads and updating market yield curves. Other assumptions included in the model that are periodically updated include loan prepayments and call provisions within investment and debt holdings. TheCompany is monitoring interest rate sensitivity closely as $4.1 billion, or 68%, of loans mature or reprice within the twelve-month period following September 30, 2023, including $2.8 billion that repriced in the first month of the fourth quarter. $5.3 billion of interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice over the same twelvemonth period. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the investment portfolioduration was approximately 5.6 and 5.2 years, respectively. The Company is reviewing additional options to manage the statement of financial condition sensitivity based on the interest rate environment and anticipated composition of assets and liabilities in the next twelvemonths and beyond.

The models the Company uses include assumptions regarding interest rates while balances remain unchanged. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income orprecisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions, customer behaviorand management strategies, among other

factors.
