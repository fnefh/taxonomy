<h2>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information</h2>
<p>All statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute forward-looking statements. T hese statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "might," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "expect," "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "projection," "would," "annualized," "position," "future" and "strategy," or the negative of these words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. For ex ample, our forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our business plans, expectations, or opportunities for growth; the proposed merger of CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., into First Busey Corporation ("Busey"), our expense control initiatives and the results expected to be realized from those initiatives; our anticipated financial results, expenses, cash requirements and sources of liquidity; our capital allocation strategies and plans; and our anticipated future financial performance.</p>
<p>Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Form 10-Q to "we," "our," "us," "CrossFirst," and the "Company" refer to CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. References in this Form 10-Q to "CrossFirst Bank" and the "Bank" refer to CrossFirst Bank, our wholly owned consolidated bank subsidiary.</p>
<p>These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs, certain assumptions made by management, and financial trends that may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy or financial needs, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, without limitation: the possibility that the proposed transaction with Busey will not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, stockholder or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated (and the risk that required regulatory approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction); the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized when expected or at all; the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the merger within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate CrossFirst's operations and those of Busey; effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of CrossFirst to retain clients and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with our suppliers, and on our operating results and business generally; uncertain or unfavorable business or economic conditions and any regulatory responses thereto, including uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, possible slowing or recessionary economic conditions and continuing or increasing inflation; geographic concentration of our markets; changes in market interest rates that affect the pricing of our products and our net interest income; our ability to effectively execute our growth strategy and manage our growth, including entering new lines of business or offering new or enhanced services or products; fluctuations in the fair value of our investments; our ability to successfully manage our credit risk, particularly in our commercial real estate, energy and commercial-based loan portfolios, and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses; declines in the values of the real estate and other collateral securing loans in our portfolio; an increase in non-performing assets; borrower and depositor concentration risks; risks associated with originating Small Business Administration loans; our dependence on our management team, including our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and their client and community relationships; our ability to raise and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital; competition from banks, credit unions, FinTech companies and other financial services providers; the effectiveness of our risk management framework; accounting estimates; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; system failures, service denials, cyber incidents or other failures, disruptions or security breaches; employee error, employee or client misconduct, fraud committed against the Company or our clients, or incomplete or inaccurate information about clients and counterparties; disruptions to our business caused by our third-party service providers; our ability to maintain our reputation; environmental liability or failure to comply with regulatory requirements affecting foreclosed properties; costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters to which we may be subject; risk exposure from transactions with financial counterparties; severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics or other health crises, acts of war or terrorism, climate change and responses thereto, or other external events; compliance with (and changes in) laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or policies relating to or affecting financial institutions, including stringent capital requirements, higher FDIC insurance premiums and assessments, consumer protection laws and privacy laws and accounting, tax, trade, monetary and fiscal matters, including the policies of the Federal Reserve and as a result of government initiatives; systemic risks across the banking industry associated with the soundness of other financial institutions; volatility in our stock price and other risks associated with our common stock; changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies and practices; or other external events. Additional discussion of these and other risk factors can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 29, 2024, and in our other filings with the SEC.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in our business, results of operations or financial condition over time, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.</p>

<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Unaudited</h2>
<h2>Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>Organization and Nature of Operations</h2>
<p>CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. ("Bankshares or "CrossFirst") is a bank holding company whose principal activities are the ownership and management of its wholly-owned subsidiary, CrossFirst Bank (the "Bank"). In addition, the Bank has three subsidiaries, including CrossFirst Investments, Inc. ("CFI"), which holds investments in marketable securities, CFBSA I, LLC and CFBSA II, LLC.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2024, Bankshares and First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Busey"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Bankshares will merge with and into Busey, with Busey as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"). The Merger Agreement further provides that at a date and time following the Merger as determined by Busey, CrossFirst Bank, a Kansas state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of CrossFirst, will merge with and into Busey Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Busey, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey and CrossFirst stockholders and the regulatory approvals for the holding company merger and the bank merger. Subject to obtaining these approvals, the parties currently expect to close the holding company merger in the first or second quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of CrossFirst ("CrossFirst Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than certain shares held by CrossFirst or Busey, will be converted into the right to receive 0.6675 of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Busey. Holders of CrossFirst Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares.</p>
<p>At the Effective Time, each share of Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of CrossFirst ("CrossFirst Preferred Stock" or "Series A Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Busey, provided that at the election of Busey, Busey may cause the CrossFirst Preferred Stock to be converted in the Merger at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the liquidation preference thereof, plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through the Effective Time.</p>
<p>The Bank is engaged in providing a full range of banking and financial services to individual and corporate clients primarily through its branches in: (i) Leawood, Kansas; (ii) Wichita, Kansas; (iii) Kansas City, Missouri; (iv) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; (v) Tulsa, Oklahoma; (vi) Dallas, Texas; (vii) Fort Worth, Texas; (viii) Frisco, Texas; (ix) Phoenix, Arizona; (x) Tucson, Arizona; (xi) Colorado Springs, Colorado; (xii) Denver, Colorado; and (xiii) Clayton, New Mexico.</p>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements serve to update the CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and include the consolidated accounts of Bankshares, the Bank, CFI, CFBSA I, LLC and CFBSA II, LLC (together, referred to herein as the "Company"). The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and where applicable, with general practices in the banking industry or guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory agencies. However, they may not include all information and notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements under GAAP applicable to annual periods and accordingly should be read in conjunction with the financial information contained in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>nature. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior years' amounts are made whenever necessary to conform to current period presentation. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. All amounts are in thousands, except share data, or as otherwise noted.</p>
<p>GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, estimates are based on judgment and available information. Management has made significant estimates in certain areas, such as the fair values of financial instruments, and the allowance for credit losses ("ACL"). Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with any estimation process and future changes in market and economic conditions, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.</p>
<p>The Company's significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 and are contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for that period. There have been no significant changes to the application of significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Related Party Transactions</h2>
<p>The Bank extends credit and receives deposits from related parties. In management's opinion, the loans and deposits were made in the ordinary course of business and made on similar terms as those prevailing at the time with other persons. Related party loans totaled $10 million and $12 million, while related party deposits totaled $90 million and $106 million, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Related parties also owned $6 million of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock at September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company</p>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 202307, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires enhanced disclosures on both an annual and interim basis about significant segment expenses, including for companies with only one reportable segment.

<p>Management evaluated all of the AFS securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses in the Company's investment portfolio were primarily caused by interest rate changes. The Company does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company did not record any credit losses on AFS securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>

<h2>Equity Securities</h2>
<p>Equity securities consist of $7.3 million of private equity investments. Equity securities are included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.</p>
<p>The Company elected a measurement alternative for its private equity investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value and did not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value using the net asset value per share. A cost basis was calculated for the equity investments. The recorded balance will adjust for any impairment or any observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. No such events occurred during the three- or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.</p>

<p>Accrued interest of $33 million and $30 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, presented in "interest receivable" on the consolidated statements of financial condition is excluded from the amortized cost basis disclosed in the above table.</p>
<p>The Company aggregates the loan portfolio by similar credit risk characteristics. The loan segments are described in additional detail below:</p>
<ul>
<li>● Commercial and Industrial - The category includes loans and lines of credit to commercial and industrial clients for use in property, plant, and equipment purchases, business operations, expansions and for working capital needs. Loan terms typically require amortizing payments that decrease the outstanding loan balance while the lines of credit typically require interest-only payments with maturities ranging from one- to three-years. Lines of credit allow the borrower to draw down and repay the line of credit based on the borrower's cash flow needs. Repayment is primarily from the cash flow of a borrower's principal business operation. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations.</li>
<li>● Energy - The category includes loans to oil and natural gas clients for use in financing working capital needs, exploration and production activities, and acquisitions. The loans are repaid primarily from the conversion of crude oil and natural gas to cash. Credit risk is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Energy loans are typically collateralized with the underlying oil and gas reserves.</p>
<ul>
<li>● Commercial Real Estate - Owner-Occupied - The category includes relationships where the Company is usually the primary provider of financial services for the company and/or the principals and the primary source of repayment is through the cash flows generated by the borrowers' business operations. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are typically secured by a first lien mortgage on real property plus assignments of all leases related to the properties. Credit risk may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.</li>
<li>● Commercial Real Estate - Non-Owner-Occupied - The category includes loans that typically involve larger principal amounts and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the leasing income generated from tenants. These are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.</li>
<li>Additionally, the category includes construction and land development loans that are based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project. Independent appraisals and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners are completed. Sources of repayment include secondary market permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing.</li>
<li>The category also includes loans that are secured by multifamily properties. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on occupancy rates and rental income.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit risk for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the borrower's market areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>● Residential Real Estate - The category includes loans that are generally secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. We also offer open- and closed-ended home equity loans, which are loans generally secured by second lien positions on residential real estate. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within or outside the borrower's market areas that might impact either property values or a borrower's personal income.</li>
<li>● Consumer - The category includes personal lines of credit and various term loans such as automobile loans and loans for other personal purposes. Repayment is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the borrower's market area) and the creditworthiness of a borrower.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Ratings</h2>
<p>The Company uses a series of grades which reflect its assessment of the credit quality of loans based on an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, liquidity and ability to meet contractual debt service requirements. Risk ratings are established for loans at origination and are monitored on an ongoing basis. The rating assigned to a loan reflects the risks posed by the borrower's expected performance and the transaction's structure. Performance metrics used to determine a risk rating include, but are not limited to, cash flow adequacy, liquidity, and collateral. A description of the loan risk ratings follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>● Pass - The category includes loans that are considered satisfactory and borrowers that generally maintain good liquidity and financial condition, or the credit is currently protected with sales trends remaining flat or declining. Most ratios compare favorably with industry norms and Company policies. Debt is programmed and timely repayment is expected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>● Special Mention - The category includes borrowers that generally exhibit adverse trends in operations or an imbalanced position in their balance sheet that has not reached a point where repayment is jeopardized. Credits are currently protected but, if left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or in the Company's credit or lien position at a future date. These credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to enough risk to warrant adverse classification.</li>
<li>● Substandard - The category includes borrowers that generally exhibit well-defined weakness(es) that jeopardize repayment. Credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. A distinct possibility exists that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Substandard loans include both performing and non-performing loans and are broken out in the table below.</li>
<li>● Doubtful - The category includes borrowers that exhibit weaknesses inherent in a substandard credit and characteristics that these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based on existing facts, conditions, and values. Because of reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the assets, classification as a loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined.</li>
<li>● Loss - Credits that are considered uncollectible or of such little value that their continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio based on internal rating categories and loan segments:</p>

<p>Non-accrual loans are loans for which the Company does not record interest income. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date, if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. The following table presents the Company's nonaccrual loans by loan segment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:</p>

<p>Interest income recognized on non-accrual loans was zero during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and</p>
<p>2023.</p>
<h2>Allowance for Credit Losses</h2>
<p>The Company's CECL committee meets at least quarterly to oversee the ACL methodology. The committee estimates the ACL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ACL represents the Company's current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date. The ACL is adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate and excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.</p>
<p>The ACL is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific / individual loan reserves; (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves; and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves.</p>
<p>Asset Specific When unique qualities cause a loan's exposure to loss to be inconsistent with the pooled reserves, the loan is individually evaluated. Individual reserves are calculated for loans that are risk-rated substandard and on non-accrual, doubtful or loss that are greater than a defined dollar threshold. Reserves on asset specific loans may be based on collateral, for collateral-dependent loans, or on quantitative and qualitative factors, including expected cash flow, market sentiment, and guarantor support.</p>
<p>Quantitative - The Company used the cohort method, which identifies and captures the balance of a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics as of a particular time to form a cohort. The cohort is then tracked for losses over the remaining life of loans or until the pool is exhausted. The Company used a lookback period of approximately six years to establish the cohort population. By using the historical data timeframe, the Company can establish a historical loss factor for each of its loan segments.</p>
<p>Qualitative - The Company uses qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss factors for current conditions. The Company primarily uses the following qualitative factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>● The nature and volume of changes in risk ratings;</li>
<li>● The volume and severity of past due loans;</li>
<li>● The volume of non-accrual loans;</li>
<li>● The nature and volume of the loan portfolio, including the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit;</li>
<li>● Changes in the Institute of Supply Management's Purchasing Manager Indices ("PMI") for services and manufacturing;</li>
<li>● Changes in collateral values;</li>

<p>The ACL balance increased $1.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and included provision of $3.5 million due to economic factors and an increase in specific reserves for several smaller commercial and industrial loans. Net chargeoffs for the quarter were $1.6 million, primarily due to charge-offs onthree commercial and industrial loans. The reserve on unfunded commitments increased $0.4 million due to a shift in the mix of loan segments and change in reserve rate.</p>
<p>The ACL balance increased $4.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and included provision of $7.6 million due to loan growth, economic factors, and an increase in specific reserves. Net charge-offs were $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to charge-offs on six commercial and industrial loans, one commercial real estate non-owner-occupied loan and one credit card account. The reserve on unfunded commitments decreased $0.8 million due to a decrease in unfunded commitments.</p>

<h2>Loan Modifications</h2>
<p>The Company considers loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties to be troubled loans and is required to evaluate whether loan modifications represent a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Such troubled debt modifications ("TDMs") may include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant-payment delays, term extensions or any combination thereof.</p>
<p>The amortized cost basis of TDMs, which were modified to facilitate repayment, were $13.5 million and $9.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the TDMs include loans modified during the prior twelve months in accordance with the accounting guidance for TDMs. At September 30, 2023, the TDMs include loans modified in the prior nine months based on the January 1, 2023 adoption of the accounting standard for TDMs. The following tables present, by loan segment, the amortized cost basis as of the dates shown for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty:</p>

<p>The Company had three TDMs that were modified and had defaulted on their modified terms during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had no TDMs that were modified and had defaulted on their modified terms. For purposes of this disclosure, the Company considers "default" to mean 90 days or more past due on principal or interest. The allowance for credit losses related to TDMs on non-accrual status is determined by individual evaluation, including collateral adequacy, using the same process as loans on non-accrual status which are not classified as TDMs.</p>

<p>The Company estimates expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision (release) for credit loss expense. The estimate is calculated for each loan segment and includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of the expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. For each pool of contractual obligations expected to be funded, the Company uses the reserve rate established for the related loan pools. The $6 million allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are included in "interest payable and other liabilities" on the statements of financial condition.</p>
<p>The following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposures have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>● Loan commitments - include revolving lines of credit, non-revolving lines of credit, and loans approved that are not yet funded. Risks inherent to revolving lines of credit often are related to the susceptibility of an individual or business experiencing unpredictable cash flow or financial troubles, thus leading to payment default. The primary risk associated with non-revolving lines of credit is the diversion of funds for other expenditures.</li>
<li>● Letters of credit - are primarily established to provide assurance to the beneficiary that the applicant will perform certain obligations arising out of a separate transaction between the beneficiary and applicant. If the obligation is not met, it gives the beneficiary the right to draw on the letter of credit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note 4: Leases</h2>
<p>The Company's leases primarily include bank branches located in Kansas City, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Dallas, Texas; Frisco, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The remaining lease terms on these branch leases range from less than one year to 18 years with certain options to renew. Renewal terms canextend the lease term between five years and 20 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in the estimated value of the right of use ("ROU") asset and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recognized one finance lease and the remaining Company leases were classified as operating leases.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new bank branch in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The lease is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2024. The lease will be recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements during the period that includes the lease's commencement date.</p>
<p>The ROU asset is included in "Other assets" on the consolidated statements of financial condition, and was $28 million and $30 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The lease liability is located in "Interest payable and other liabilities" on the consolidated statements of financial condition and was $31 million and $34 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, the remaining weighted-average lease term was10.2 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 2.78% utilizing the Company's incremental Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowing rate for borrowings of a similar term at the date of lease commencement.</p>

<h2>Supplemental cash flow information</h2>
<p>Operating cash flows paid for operating leases included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating cash flows paid for finance lease amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.4 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not record any ROU assets that were exchanged for operating lease liabilities.</p>
<h2>Note 5: Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangible</h2>
<p>Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs annual tests to identify impairment of goodwill and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. No goodwill impairment was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company is amortizing the core deposit intangible ("CDI") over its estimated useful life of approximately10 years from the date of each respective acquisition using the sum of the years' digits accelerated method.</p>
<p>The gross carrying amount of goodwill and the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the CDI at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:</p>

<h2>Note 6: Derivatives and Hedging</h2>
<p>The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management activities to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company's existing credit derivatives result from participations of loan participation arrangements, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company's assets or liabilities.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>The Company uses interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company may utilize interest rate swaps, including forwards, interest rate caps, floors, collars, corridors and swaptions as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company had interest rate swaps and a collar to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt and loan assets in place. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract. During the first nine months of 2024, two cash flow hedges matured and two cash flow hedges were terminated. Derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges and are designated as such include one instrument with a total notional value of $250 million at September 30, 2024, and five instruments with a total notional value of $340 million at December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk and are designated as such, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into interest income or expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income and expense as interest payments are received and made on the Company's variable-rate assets and debt. The Company currently estimates that $0.5 million will be reclassified as a net decrease to net interest income during the next twelve months. These reclassifications are for active hedges, as well as amounts related to five hedged swaps that were terminated in 2022 and the two hedged swaps terminated in the first quarter of 2024, that continue to be recognized based on the original effective dates of the hedged transactions.</p>
<p>The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 2.3 years.</p>
<h2>Non-designated Hedges</h2>
<p>Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service provided to clients. The Company executes interest rate swaps with clients to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third-party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements and changes in the fair value of both the client derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.</p>
<p>Swap fees earned upon origination and credit valuation adjustments that represent the risk of a counterparty's default are reported on the consolidated statements of operations as swap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net. The effect of the Company's derivative financial instruments gain (loss) is reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows within "other assets" and "other liabilities".</p>
<p>The Company had 50 and 46 swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $356 million and $307 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>The Company's existing credit derivatives result from participations in or out of interest rate swaps provided by or to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company's assets or liabilities. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain lenders which participate in loans.</p>
<p>The Company had 13 credit risk participation agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $71 million at September 30, 2024.</p>

<h2>Note 9: Regulatory Matters</h2>
<p>The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.</p>
<p>The capital rules require the Company to maintain a2.5% capital conservation buffer with respect to Common Equity Tier I capital, Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and total capital to risk-weighted assets, which is included in the column "Required to be Considered Adequately Capitalized" within the table below. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, as well as certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.</p>
<p>The Company and the Bank opted to exclude AOCI from the regulatory capital calculations. As a result, changes in AOCI, net of tax, do not impact the Company's or Bank's regulatory capital ratios.</p>
<p>The Company's and the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the following table:</p>

<h2>Note 11: Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recurring Measurements</h2>
<p>The following list presents the assets and liabilities recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:</p>

<p>Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.</p>
<p>Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans, Net of ACL The estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. If the fair value of the collateral is below the loan's amortized cost, the ACL is netted against the loan balance. Collateral-dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Office of the Chief Credit Officer. Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and</p>
<p>consistency by management. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated costs to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimates are developed by the Office of the Chief Credit Officer by comparison to historical results.</p>
<p>Foreclosed Assets Held-for-Sale The fair value of foreclosed assets-held-for-sale is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell.</p>
<h2>Unobservable (Level 3) Inputs</h2>

<h2>Third Quarter 2024 Highlights</h2>
<p>During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, we accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>● Jointly announced a proposed partnership with First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Busey"), pursuant to which CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. ("Bankshares" or "CrossFirst") would merge with and into Busey; the partnership would extend Busey's regional operating model in the high-growth metro markets where CrossFirst operates and offer additional opportunities for the combined entity to grow its wealth management business and FirsTech, Inc., Busey's payment technology solutions subsidiary</li>
</ul>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>● Improved profitability as operating revenue$^{(1)}$, adjusted net income$^{(2)}$, adjusted diluted earnings per common share$^{(2)}$, and adjusted return on average common equity$^{(2)}$ increased compared to the prior quarter and the prior year third quarter</li>
<li>● Net interest margin - FTE grew to 3.29%, benefiting from the repricing lag between assets and liabilities from the September interest rate cut</li>
<li>● Loans ended the quarter at $6.3 billion, flat with the prior quarter, and grew $203 million, or 3%, year-to-date. Loan demand slowed in the quarter temporarily as clients awaited actions by the Federal Reserve</li>
<li>● Deposits ended the quarter at $6.6 billion, a decrease of $100 million, or 1%, for the quarter, and grew $143 million, or 2%, year-to-date; average deposits increased $162 million, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter, as strong client deposit growth in the third quarter outpaced the seasonally lower average deposits in the second quarter</li>
<li>● Non-performing assets were 0.34% of total assets, annualized net charge-offs represented 0.10% of average loans and classified loans declined meaningfully</li>
<li>● Provision expense was $3.5 million, which was $1.1 million higher than the second quarter due to an increase in net charge-offs, economic factors and an increase in specific reserves for several smaller commercial and industrial credits</li>
<li>● Non-interest expense totaled $38.6 million and increased $0.9 million from the prior quarter, but included $2.4 million of merger-related costs; adjusting for merger-related costs, non-interest expense was lower $1.5 million and within the guided range as savings from our core processing contract renegotiation were realized</li>
<li>● Increased capital ratios and remained well capitalized with total risk-based capital of 11.8% and common equity Tier 1 capital of 10.6%</li>
<li>● Grew book value per common share 6% to $15.65 at September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter-end; tangible book value per common share$^{(2)}$ also grew 6% to $14.92 during the same period</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mergers and Acquisitions Update</h2>
<p>As previously disclosed, on August 26, 2024, CrossFirst and Busey entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey, with Busey as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"). The Merger Agreement further provides that at a date and time following the Merger as determined by Busey, CrossFirst Bank, a Kansas state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of CrossFirst, will merge with and into Busey Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of Busey, with Busey Bank as the surviving bank. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey and CrossFirst stockholders and the regulatory approvals for the holding company merger and the bank merger. Subject to obtaining these approvals, the parties currently expect to close the holding company merger in the first or second quarter of 2025. The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 27, 2024 and incorporated by reference in Exhibit 2.1 to this report.</p>
<h2>Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>Income from Operations</h2>
<p>Net income totaled $19.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $16.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income totaled $56.5 million, or $1.12 per diluted common share, and $49.0 million, or $0.99 per diluted common share, respectively. Compared to the third</p>
<p>quarter of 2023, the results for the third quarter of 2024 reflect higher net interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense and higher provision expense. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include higher net interest income, higher non-interest income and lower provision expense, partially offset by higher non-interest expense.</p>
<p>Annualized return on average assets was 1.02% and 1.01% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Annualized return on average common equity was 10.54% and 10.50% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.</p>
<h2>Net Interest Income</h2>
<p>Our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income, which is discussed below on a GAAP and FTE basis. We believe providing disclosure on an FTE basis provides for improved comparability between the various earning assets. Changes in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest yields.</p>
<p>The following table presents, for the periods indicated, average statement of financial condition information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yield and rates paid:</p>

<p>Net interest income increased $6.0 million and $7.8 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income - FTE for the third quarter of 2024 increased $5.8 million due to higher average earning assets and the expansion of net interest margin - FTE by 10 basis points to 3.29%. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net interest income - FTE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $7.1 million as the benefits from higher average earning assets and one additional day were partially offset by a 13 basis point reduction in net interest margin - FTE.</p>
<p>The FTE yield on earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 increased 43 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to stronger loan yields and higher yields on securities. The cost of a rate hedge partially offset the earning asset yield increase by seven basis points. The cost of funds increased 35 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to pricing pressure on deposits, client migration into higher cost deposit products and a reduction in average non-interest-bearing deposits compared to the prior year. The $502 million increase in average earning assets was driven by higher average loan and securities balances, as well as higher average cash balances.</p>
<p>The FTE yield on earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 48 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to stronger loan yields and higher yields on securities. The cost of a rate hedge partially offset the earning asset yield increase by seven basis points. The cost of funds increased 68 basis points for the same comparative period due to pricing pressure on deposits, client migration into higher cost deposit products and a reduction in average non-interestbearing deposits compared to the prior year. The $559 million increase in average earning assets was driven by higher average loan and securities balances, partially offset by lower average cash balances.</p>
<p>The full-year 2024 net interest margin - FTE is currently expected to be at the high end of the prior guidance range of 3.20% to 3.25%.</p>

<p>Provision expense of $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs, economic factors and an increase in specific reserves for several smaller commercial and industrial clients. Provision expense of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by loan growth partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments ("RUC"). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision expense decreased $2.8 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower loan growth.</p>

<p>The changes in non-interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 were driven primarily by a decrease in gain on sale of loans, largely offset by increases in client-related swap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net and other non-interest income. The decrease in gain on sale of loans was due to timing and decreased volume of loan sale activity. The increase in swap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net was driven by increased transaction fees, partially offset by credit valuation adjustments. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily due to realized gains on available-for-sale securities.</p>
<p>The changes in non-interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 were driven primarily by increases in ATM and credit card interchange income, service charges and fees on client accounts, and other non-interest income, partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of loans. The increase in ATM and credit card interchange income was related to higher interchange income, driven by new client spend and higher spend volume by existing clients. The increase in service charges and fees on client accounts was driven by new clients as well as an increase in client activity. The increase in swap fees and other non-interest income was primarily due to higher client-related fees. The decrease in gain on sale of loans was due to timing and decreased volume of loan sale activity.</p>

<p>Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included $2.4 million of merger-related expenses with $1.8 million included in professional fees, $0.5 million in salaries and employee benefits, and $0.1 million in other non-interest expense. The third quarter of 2023 included $1.3 million of merger-related expenses with $0.8 million included in professional fees, $0.3 million in salaries and employee benefits, $0.1 million in software and communications, and $0.1 million in other non-interest expense. Excluding these merger-related expenses, non-interest expense decreased $1.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increased $1.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Exclusive of the merger-related expenses noted above in both comparative periods, salaries and employee benefits were higher compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to annual merit increases. Professional fees, excluding merger-related costs, decreased compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower consulting and outside services fees. Data processing expenses and software and communication expenses both decreased compared to the third quarter of 2023 related to the renegotiation of our core system contract in the second quarter of 2024. Other non-interest expense, excluding merger-related costs, increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to higher travel and meeting expenses and fees related to the implementation of a new digital banking platform.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $2.0 million compared to the same period in 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $2.4 million of merger-related expenses with $1.8 million included in professional fees, $0.5 million in salaries and employee benefits, and $0.1 million in other non-interest expense. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included $3.1 million of merger-related expenses, most of which were included in professional fees and salaries and employee benefits, and $1.3 million of employee separation costs included in salaries and employee benefits. Excluding these merger-related expenses and employee separation costs, non-interest expense increased $4.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, deposit insurance premiums, data processing expense, software and communications expense and other non-interest expense, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and advertising expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to higher salaries and incentive costs related to merit increases. Other non-interest expense increased primarily due to fees related to the implementation of a new digital banking platform and higher travel and meeting expenses. Data processing expense increased due to costs related to the renegotiation of our core systems contract, partially offset by decreases in internet</p>
<p>banking expenses. Deposit insurance premiums increased primarily due to a higher assessment rate due to the balance sheet composition. Occupancy costs as well as software and communications expense increased primarily due to new locations from both organic expansion in the high-growth Dallas-Fort Worth market and from an acquisition in Arizona. Professional fees decreased primarily due to the digital banking project costs in the prior year. Advertising expense decreased due to less discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Our GAAP efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 57.52% and our adjusted efficiency ratio - FTE was 52.30% compared to 59.49% and 55.17% on a GAAP reported and adjusted basis, respectively, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Our GAAP efficiency ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 59.01% and our adjusted efficiency ratio - FTE was 55.93% compared to 60.77% and 56.28% on a GAAP reported and adjusted basis, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for a reconciliation of our adjusted efficiency ratio FTE to our GAAP efficiency ratio. Non-interest expenses are currently expected to be in a range of $36-37 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 excluding merger-related costs.</p>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>Our income tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily due to investments in tax advantaged assets, such as bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt municipal securities, state tax credits and permanent tax differences from stock-based compensation.</p>
<p>The tax-exempt benefit diminishes as the Company's ratio of taxable income to tax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to remain in the range of 20% to 22% for the remainder of 2024. Our income tax and effective tax rate is presented below for the periods indicated:</p>

<h2>Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition</h2>
<p>Total assets were $7.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $7.4 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 3%. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $18 million, or 7%, and investment securities increased $17 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. Loans increased $203 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2023, and the allowance for credit losses increased $4 million to $78 million at September 30, 2024. Total deposits increased $143 million to $6.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances totaled $76 million and decreased slightly compared to December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Investment Portfolio</h2>
<p>The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to ensure adequate liquidity, including serving as a contingent, onbalance sheet source of liquidity. In addition, we manage the portfolio in a manner that optimizes earnings, manages credit and interest rate risk, and meets pledging and regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was 100% available-for-sale and totaled $784 million, an increase of $17 million from December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The increase in the investment portfolio was driven by the purchase of $71 million in mortgage-backed securities and $5 million in collateralized mortgage obligations, and a $9 million reduction in the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. The increase was partially offset by the sale of $20 million in tax-exempt municipal securities and $46 million of paydowns and maturities of investment securities. Our current investment strategy includes reducing the concentration in municipal investments, investing in lower risk-weighted assets and restructuring the</p>
<p>portfolio to increase liquidity and provide more balanced cash flow. For additional information, including information regarding other securities owned by the Company, see "Note 2: Securities" in the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited.</p>

<p>Non-performing Assets and Other Asset Quality Metrics</p>
<p>Non-performing assets include: (i) non-performing loans - includes non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing; (ii) foreclosed assets held for sale; (iii) repossessed assets; and (iv) impaired debt securities.</p>
<p>Non-performing assets increased $9.1 million during the quarter to $25.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in loans 90+ days past due and still accruing and foreclosed assets held for sale. The non-performing assets to total assets ratio increased from 0.22% at June 30, 2024 to 0.34% at September 30, 2024. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.10% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.07% in the quarter ended June 30,</p>
<p>2024 and 0.09% in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The Company continues to monitor the U.S. economic indicators, including the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, commodity prices, interest rates, and potential supply chain disruptions and the impact they may have on the Company's markets, clients, and prospects. The Company is monitoring the impact of the interest rate environment on the commercial real estate market and enterprise and leverage loans that is currently partially mitigated by low debt-to-equity ratios. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any systemic issues within its loan portfolio that would materially affect the credit quality of the loan portfolio. However, the Company continues to closely monitor credits for risk rating migration, in particular in certain sectors of the commercial real estate portfolio where projects may be faced with higher interest rates, operating costs, and property taxes.</p>

<h2>Deposits and Other Borrowings</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2024, our deposits totaled $6.6 billion, an increase of $143 million or 2% from December 31, 2023. The increase included a $156 million increase in time deposits and a $77 million increase in money market, NOW and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $90 million in non-interest-bearing deposits. The increase in time deposits was primarily related to new clients and shifts from other deposits products, while the increase in money market, NOW and savings deposits was primarily related to new clients. Other borrowings include FHLB advances, SBA loan secured borrowings, and our trust preferred security and totaled $85 million and $87 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.</p>

<p>As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $2.7 billion of uninsured deposits, which is an estimated amount based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. Excluding passthru accounts where clients have deposit insurance at the correspondent financial institution, our uninsured deposits were $2.3 billion, or 34% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. The average client account balance as of September 30, 2024 was less than $250 thousand for both individual accounts and business accounts in total after excluding pass-through and insured cash sweep deposits. We have geographic and industry diversity within our deposit base as the majority of our deposits are located in our footprint states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. The Company believes that its current capital ratios and liquidity are sufficient to mitigate the risks of uninsured deposits.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>We manage our liquidity based upon factors that include the level and quality of capital and our overall financial condition, the trend and volume of problem assets, our balance sheet risk exposure, the level of deposits as a percentage of total loans, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources and off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, and other factors. We also conduct contingency funding plan stress tests at least annually to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed potentially problematic by management. The Company's liquidity strategy is to maintain adequate, but not excessive, liquidity to meet the daily cash flow needs of our clients while attempting to achieve maximum earnings for our stockholders. The Company measures liquidity needs through daily balance sheet monitoring, weekly cash projections and monthly liquidity measures reviewed in conjunction with Board-approved liquidity policy limits. The Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio, increases in client deposits and wholesale deposits. The Company believes that other alternative sources of funds are available to supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary to meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-term or long-term basis. Liquidity resources can be derived from two sources: (i) on-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds currently on the statement of financial condition and (ii) off-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent funds available from third-party sources. The Company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity resources consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>The consolidated statements of cash flows - unaudited summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $237 million and $233 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating activities provided $71.3 million and $71.2 million of cash, respectively, while financing activities provided $135.6 million and $374.5 million of cash, respectively. The primary drivers of lower cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were a smaller increase in time deposits, lower FHLB and line of credit borrowings, 2024 share repurchases and the 2023 preferred share issuance, partially offset by an increase in demand and savings, NOW and money market accounts and lower FHLB borrowings repayments. Cash usage from investing activities was $225.2 million and $512.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary drivers of lower cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for investing activities was that the prior year included more loan origination volume and more purchases of AFS securities, partially offset by higher proceeds from AFS maturities and sales in the prior year.</p>
<p>Off-balance sheet liquidity slightly increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to normal fluctuations in our available capacity from third party sources.</p>
<p>The Company purchased $4.5 million of common stock during the first nine months of 2024 under its previously approved share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, $11.4 million remained available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. The amount and timing of such future share repurchases will be dependent on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, overall capital levels and cash flow needs. There is no assurance that we will repurchase up to the full amount remaining under our program.</p>
<p>Dividends of $465 thousand related to the Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock were declared and paid by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On October 17, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in the amount of $20.00 per share to be payable on December 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company believes that its current on and off-balance sheet liquidity will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter. The Company believes that it has several on and off-balance sheet options to address reductions in cash and cash equivalents in order to maintain appropriate liquidity.</p>
<h2>Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>The Company is subject to contractual obligations made in the ordinary course of business. The obligations include deposit liabilities, other borrowed funds, operating leases, and preferred dividends. To the extent declared by the Board of Directors, the Company may pay $0.6 million of cash dividends per year to holders of our preferred stock. Refer to "Note 7: Time Deposits and Borrowings" and "Note 4: Leases" within the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for information regarding the Company's significant contractual cash obligations and contractual obligations to third parties on lease obligations, respectively.</p>
<p>As a financial services provider, the Company is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit. Off-balance sheet arrangements represent the Company's future cash requirements. However, a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Refer to "Note 12: Commitments and Credit Risk" within the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for a listing of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements.</p>
<p>The Company's short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations, may be satisfied through the Company's on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity discussed above.</p>
<h2>Capital Requirements</h2>
<p>The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. The regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities,</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>select off-balance sheet items and equity. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to "Note 9: Regulatory Matters" in the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited for additional information. Management believes that as of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and with general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for management judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent, objective sources. The Company evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
<p>A discussion of these policies can be found in the section captioned "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in the Company's application of critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>Refer to "Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" included in the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>In addition to disclosing financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures including "tangible common stockholders' equity," "tangible book value per common share," "adjusted efficiency ratio - FTE," "adjusted net income," "adjusted diluted earnings per common share," "adjusted return on average assets," and "adjusted return on average common equity." We consider the use of select nonGAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-toperiod comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or gains that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing, and comparing past, present and future periods.</p>
<p>These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and you should not rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by our peers or other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance.</p>
<p>A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures follows.</p>

<h2>ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>A primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Interest rate risk management is a key element of the Company's statement of financial condition management. Interest rate risk is the risk that net interest margins will erode over time due to changing market conditions. Many factors can cause margins to erode including, without limitation, (i) lower loan demand; (ii) increased competition for funds; (iii) weak pricing policies; (iv) statement of financial condition mismatches; and (v) changing liquidity demands. The objective is to maximize income while minimizing interest rate risk. The Company manages its sensitivity position using its interest rate risk policy. The management of interest rate risk is a three-step process and involves: (i) measuring the interest rate risk position; (ii) assessing policy constraints; and (iii) strategic review and implementation.</p>
<p>Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors. ALCO uses a combination of three systems to measure the statement of financial condition's interest rate risk position. The three systems in combination are expected to provide a better overall result than a single system alone. The three systems include: (i) gap reports; (ii) earnings simulation; and (iii) economic value of equity. ALCO's primary instruments for managing interest rate risk include: (i) modifying the duration of interest-bearing liabilities; (ii) modifying the duration of interestearning assets, including our investment portfolio; and (iii) entering into on-balance sheet derivatives. The Company may utilize interest swaps for the purpose of managing interest rate risk, including forwards, interest rate caps, floors, collars, corridors and swaptions.</p>
<p>ALCO evaluates interest rate risk using a rate shock method and rate ramp method. In a rate shock analysis, rates change immediately, and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate ramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. Management reviews and utilizes both methods in managing interest rate risk; however, both methods represent a risk indicator, not a forecast. The following tables summarize the simulated changes in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon using a rate shock and rate ramp method as of the dates indicated:</p>

<p>The Company's position is slightly liability sensitive as of September 30, 2024. Loans remain the largest portion of the Company's variable rate earning assets, and $4.6 billion, or 72%, of loans mature or reprice within the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024, including $3.9 billion that repriced in October 2024. The Company expects $3.6 billion of time deposits, indexed deposits and other borrowings will reprice in the next twelve months. Approximately 95% of the Company's time deposits mature within the next twelve months, with 42% maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the Company has 26% of its deposits indexed to the federal funds rate. The Company also holds a $250 million notional interest rate collar, which was executed in July 2022 and became effective in January 2024. The collar contributes to the Company's slightly liability sensitive position. The Company continuously monitors the interest rate environment and will evaluate available derivative strategies to protect net interest margin as needed. Additional information regarding the Company's on-balance sheet derivative activity is incorporated herein from "Note 6: Derivatives and Hedging" within the notes to consolidated financial statements - unaudited. The Company's sensitivity position as of September 30, 2024 is slightly more liability sensitive compared to September 30, 2023 primarily due to the collar derivative and the shorter duration of the time deposit portfolio compared to the prior period.</p>
<p>The models the Company uses include assumptions regarding interest rates and balance changes. The aggregate nonmaturity beta assumption utilized as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 70%. Other key assumptions updated during the third quarter of 2024 include new loan spreads and updated market yield curves. Other assumptions included in the model that are periodically updated include deposit decay rates, loan prepayments and call provisions within investment and debt holdings. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions, client behavior and management strategies, among other factors.</p>

<h2>ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act")) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>Our internal control over financial reporting continues to be updated as necessary to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are named or threatened to be named as a defendant in various lawsuits. Management, following consultation with legal counsel, does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or growth prospects. However, given the nature, scope, and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to our business (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and antiterrorism laws), we, like all banking organizations, are subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>In addition to the other information set forth in this report and the risk factors below, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Risks Relating to the Consummation of the Merger</h2>
<h2>Because the market price of Busey common stock may fluctuate, CrossFirst stockholders cannot be certain of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive.</h2>
<p>In the Merger, each share of CrossFirst common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except for shares of CrossFirst common stock owned by CrossFirst as treasury stock or owned by CrossFirst or Busey (in each case, other than shares of CrossFirst common stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by CrossFirst or Busey in respect of debts previously contracted), will be converted into 0.6675 of a share of Busey common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Busey common stock or CrossFirst common stock. Changes in the price of Busey common stock between now and the time of the Merger will affect the value that CrossFirst stockholders will receive in the Merger. Neither Busey nor CrossFirst is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of Busey common stock or CrossFirst common stock.</p>
<p>Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Busey's and CrossFirst's businesses, operations and prospects, the performance of peer companies and other</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>financial companies, volatility in the prices of securities in global financial markets, including market prices of Busey, CrossFirst and other banking companies, and regulatory considerations and tax laws, many of which are beyond Busey's and CrossFirst's control. Therefore, at the time of the CrossFirst special meeting of stockholders, CrossFirst stockholders will not know the market value of the merger consideration that CrossFirst stockholders will receive at the effective time of the Merger.</p>
<h2>The market price of Busey common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of Busey common stock or CrossFirst common stock.</h2>
<p>In the Merger, CrossFirst stockholders will become Busey stockholders. Busey's business differs from that of CrossFirst and certain adjustments may be made to Busey's business as a result of the Merger. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Busey common stock after the completion of the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Busey and CrossFirst. Changes in the operations and prospects of Busey or CrossFirst, general market and economic conditions and other factors which may be beyond the control of Busey and CrossFirst, and the market prices of Busey common stock and CrossFirst common stock may alter the value of Busey or CrossFirst or the prices of shares of Busey common stock and shares of CrossFirst common stock by the time the Merger is completed.</p>
<h2>Busey and CrossFirst are expected to incur substantial costs related to the Merger and integration.</h2>
<p>Busey and CrossFirst have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees, financial printing and other printing costs and other related costs.</p>
<p>In addition, the combined company will incur integration costs following the completion of the Merger as Busey and CrossFirst integrate their businesses, including facilities, and systems, consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Busey and CrossFirst may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, branch operations, vendor management, risk management, lines of business, pricing and benefits. While Busey and CrossFirst have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs. Moreover, many of the costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration costs may result in the combined company taking charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. Anticipated pre-tax transaction costs for both CrossFirst and Busey combined are currently estimated to be approximately $75.3 million.</p>
<h2>Combining Busey and CrossFirst may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.</h2>
<p>The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Busey and CrossFirst. To realize the anticipated benefits from the Merger, Busey must successfully integrate CrossFirst into its existing businesses and, in particular, integrate CrossFirst into its risk management framework, compliance systems and corporate culture, in a manner that permits the anticipated benefits to be realized and that does not materially disrupt existing client relationships or result in decreased revenues due to the loss of clients. If Busey is not able to successfully achieve these objectives for any reason, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.</p>
<p>An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of Busey following the completion of the</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Merger, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of Busey following the completion of the Merger.</p>
<h2>Busey and CrossFirst have operated and, until the effective time of the Merger, must continue to operate independently.</h2>
<p>It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key CrossFirst employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect each company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Busey and CrossFirst during this transition period and on Busey for an undetermined period after the completion of the Merger. Busey's results following the Merger may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations.</p>
<p>Following the Merger, the size of the business of Busey will increase beyond its current size. Busey's future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. Busey may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increased size of its business. There can be no assurances that Busey will be successful or that it will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.</p>
<h2>The combined company may be unable to retain Busey and/or CrossFirst personnel successfully after the Merger is completed.</h2>
<p>The success of the Merger will depend in part on Busey's ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by CrossFirst. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with CrossFirst while the Merger is pending or with Busey after the Merger. If Busey and CrossFirst are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Busey and CrossFirst could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing clients, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the Merger, if key employees terminate their employment, Busey's business activities may be adversely affected, and management's attention may be diverted from successfully hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Busey's business to suffer. Busey and CrossFirst also may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.</p>
<h2>Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on Busey following the Merger.</h2>
<p>Before the Merger and the bank merger may be completed, various approvals and consents must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the "IDFPR") and the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner (the "KOSBC") and other regulatory authorities in the United States. Busey submitted applications to the Federal Reserve Board, the IDFPR and the KOSBC in connection with the proposed Merger and the bank merger on or about September 23, 2024.</p>
<p>These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to (i) an adverse development in either party's regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals; (ii) governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or (iii) changes in legislation or the political environment generally. Additionally, over the past several years, mergers of banking organizations have encountered greater regulatory, governmental and community scrutiny and have taken substantially longer to receive the necessary regulatory approvals and other required governmental clearances than in the past.</p>
<p>The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of Busey's business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of Busey following the Merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the Merger were consummated successfully within the expected time frame. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without the imposition of any material burdensome regulatory condition. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, despite the parties' commitments to using their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, neither Busey nor CrossFirst, nor any of their respective subsidiaries, is permitted (without the written consent of the other party) to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the required permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of governmental entities or regulatory agencies that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the bank merger.</p>
<h2>Certain of Busey's and CrossFirst's directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that may differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of Busey stockholders and CrossFirst stockholders.</h2>
<p>CrossFirst stockholders should be aware that some of Busey's and CrossFirst's directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of Busey stockholders and CrossFirst stockholders. These interests and arrangements may create potential conflicts of interest. The Busey and CrossFirst boards of directors were aware of these respective interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making their decisions to approve the Merger Agreement, and in recommending that, in the case of the Busey board of directors, Busey stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of Busey common stock to CrossFirst stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and, in the case of the CrossFirst board of directors, CrossFirst stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement.</p>
<h2>The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.</h2>
<p>The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: (i) approval by Busey stockholders of the Busey merger proposal and approval by CrossFirst stockholders of the CrossFirst merger proposal; (ii) authorization for listing on Nasdaq of the shares of Busey common stock to be issued in the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance; (iii) the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, the IDFPR and the KOSBC; (iv) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4; and (v) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or making the completion of the Merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal. Each party's obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a) subject to applicable materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (b) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (c) the receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (d) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to Busey or CrossFirst.</p>
<p>These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after the requisite stockholder approvals, or Busey or CrossFirst may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact Busey or CrossFirst.</h2>
<p>If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Busey stockholders failing to approve the Busey merger proposal or CrossFirst stockholders failing to approve the CrossFirst merger proposal, there may be various adverse consequences, and CrossFirst may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its clients, employees and stockholders. For example, CrossFirst's businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of CrossFirst common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be beneficial and will be completed. CrossFirst also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to proceedings commenced against CrossFirst to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, CrossFirst may be required to pay a termination fee of $36.7 million to Busey.</p>
<p>Additionally, CrossFirst has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, CrossFirst would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.</p>
<p>In connection with the Merger, Busey will assume CrossFirst's outstanding debt obligations, and Busey's level of indebtedness following the completion of the Merger could adversely affect Busey's ability to raise additional capital and to meet its obligations under its existing indebtedness.</p>
<p>In connection with the Merger, Busey will assume CrossFirst's outstanding indebtedness. Busey's existing debt, together with any future incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences for Busey's creditors and Busey's stockholders. For example, it could limit Busey's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, and could require a significant portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on Busey's indebtedness, thereby reducing Busey's ability to use cash flows to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.</p>
<h2>Busey and CrossFirst will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.</h2>
<p>Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on Busey and CrossFirst. These uncertainties may impair Busey's or CrossFirst's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with Busey or CrossFirst to seek to change existing business relationships with Busey or CrossFirst. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Busey and CrossFirst have each agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on a timely basis without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent Busey and/or CrossFirst from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.</p>
<p>The announcement of the proposed Merger could disrupt Busey's and CrossFirst's relationships with their clients, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as their operating results and businesses generally.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Merger is ultimately consummated, as a result of uncertainty related to the proposed transactions, risks relating to the impact of the announcement of the Merger on Busey's and CrossFirst's businesses include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· their employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect Busey's and CrossFirst's ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>· clients, suppliers, business partners and other parties with which Busey and CrossFirst maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about their respective futures and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with Busey and CrossFirst or fail to extend an existing relationship with Busey and CrossFirst; and</li>
<li>· Busey and CrossFirst have each expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services and transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, they could lead to significant costs which may impact each party's results of operations and financial condition.</p>
<h2>The Merger Agreement limits Busey's and CrossFirst's respective abilities to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Busey or CrossFirst.</h2>
<p>The Merger Agreement contains "no shop" covenants that restrict each of Busey's and CrossFirst's ability to directly or indirectly, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by Busey's and CrossFirst's respective board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $36.7 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Busey or CrossFirst from considering or proposing that acquisition.</p>
<h2>The shares of Busey common stock to be received by CrossFirst stockholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of CrossFirst common stock.</h2>
<p>In the Merger, CrossFirst stockholders will become Busey stockholders, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Nevada law and the governing documents of the combined company following the Merger. The rights associated with Busey common stock are different from the rights associated with CrossFirst common stock.</p>
<h2>CrossFirst stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the consummation of the Merger and will exercise less influence over management.</h2>
<p>CrossFirst stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting CrossFirst. When the Merger is completed, each CrossFirst stockholder will become a holder of common stock of the combined company, with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the holder's percentage ownership of CrossFirst prior to the consummation of the Merger. Based on the number of shares of Busey common stock and CrossFirst common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the respective record dates, and based on the number of shares of Busey common stock expected to be issued in the Merger, the former CrossFirst stockholders as a group are estimated to own approximately thirty-six and one-half percent (36.5%) of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger, and current Busey stockholders, as a group, are estimated to own approximately sixty-three and one half percent (63.5%) of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger. Because of this, CrossFirst stockholders may have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of CrossFirst.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Issuance of shares of Busey common stock in connection with the Merger may adversely affect the market price of Busey common stock.</h2>
<p>In connection with the payment of the merger consideration, Busey expects to issue shares of Busey common stock to CrossFirst stockholders. The issuance of these new shares of Busey common stock may result in fluctuations in the market price of Busey common stock, including a stock price decrease.</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) None.</li>
<li>(b) Not applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>(c) Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>On May 10, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock. The objective of the program is to give the Company the ability to opportunistically acquire undervalued shares and return capital to stockholders. No shares were repurchased during the three- months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, $11.4 million remained available for repurchase under this share repurchase program. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with SEC Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. No time limit has been set for completion of the program.</p>
<p>The Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders and repurchase shares is affected by both general corporate law requirements and the regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies, including the Basel III Capital Rules. In addition, so long as any Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless full dividends for the most recently completed dividend period have been declared and paid (or declared and the payment amount has been set aside), the Company may not, subject to certain exceptions, declare, pay or set aside for payment any dividend on its common stock, or repurchase or redeem its common stock. The Company's principal source of funds to pay distributions on its common stock, other than further issuances of securities, is dividends received from its wholly owned subsidiaries. Furthermore, the ability of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company would depend on the earnings or financial condition of such wholly owned subsidiaries and various business considerations. In addition, various federal and state statutes limit the amount of dividends that the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval.</p>
