<h2>SINTX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SINTX Technologies, Inc. ("SINTX") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SINTX Armor, Inc. ("SINTX Armor") and Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. (TA&amp;T), which are collectively referred to as "we" or "the Company". SINTX is an advanced ceramics company formed in December 1996 (and was previously known as Amedica Corporation) and is focused on providing solutions in a variety of biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. We have grown from focusing primarily on the research, development and commercialization of medical devices manufactured with silicon nitride to becoming an advanced ceramics company engaged in diverse fields, including biomedical, technical and antipathogenic applications. This diversification enables us to focus on our core competencies, which are the manufacturing, research, and development of products comprised from advanced ceramic materials for external partners. We seek to connect with new customers, partners and manufacturers to help them realize the goal of leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics to create new, innovative products across these sectors. The Company presently manufactures ceramic powders and components in its Salt Lake City and Maryland facilities. The SINTX Salt Lake City facility is FDA and ANVISA registered, ISO 13485:2016 certified, and ASD9100D certified. The Company's products are primarily sold in the United States.</p>
<p>The Company is focused on building revenue generating opportunities in three business industries - biomedical, technical (including aerospace and armor), and antipathogenic - thereby connecting with current and new customers, partners and manufacturers to help realize the goal of leveraging expertise in high-tech ceramics to create new, innovative opportunities across these sectors. We expect our continued investment in research and development to provide additional revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>SINTX believes it is the first and only manufacturer to use silicon nitride in medical applications primarily focused on spine fusion therapies. Since then, we have developed other applications for our silicon nitride technology as well as utilized our expertise in the use of ceramic materials in other applications. In July 2021, the Company acquired the equipment and obtained certain proprietary know-how rights it is now using to develop, manufacture, and commercialize protective armor from boron carbide and a composite material of silicon carbide and boron carbide for military, law enforcement and civilian uses. The protective armor operations are housed in SINTX Armor. In June 2022, the Company acquired TA&amp;T, a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services.</p>
<p>On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its retail spine business to CTL Medical, a Dallas, Texas-based privately held medical device manufacturer. As a result of the sale, CTL Medical became the exclusive owner of the Company's portfolio of metal and silicon nitride spine products, as well as access to future silicon nitride spine technologies developed by the Company. The Company's name, Amedica, was also transferred to CTL Medical, which is now CTL Amedica. The Company serves as CTL's exclusive OEM provider of silicon nitride spine products. Manufacturing, R&amp;D, and all intellectual property related to the core, non-spine, biomaterial technology including silicon nitride remains with the Company.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name to SINTX Technologies, Inc. The Company also changed its trading symbol on the NASDAQ Capital Market to "SINT".</p>
<p>The Company's new corporate brand reflects both the Company's core competence in the science and production of silicon nitride ceramics and other ceramics, as well as encouraging prospects for the future, as an OEM supplier of spine implants to CTL Amedica, and multiple opportunities outside of spine.</p>

<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and include all assets and liabilities of the Company.</p>
<p>SEC rules and regulations allow the omission of certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") so long as the statements are not misleading. In the opinion of management, these financial statements and accompanying notes contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. The Company's significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>Reverse Stock Split</h2>
<p>On December 20, 2022, the Company effected a 1 for 100 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock. The par value and the authorized shares of the common and preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All common stock shares, equivalents, and per-share amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2023, the most significant estimate relates to derivative liabilities relating to common stock warrants.</p>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $5.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $11.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $268.4 million and $262.5 million as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. To date, the Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operating activities. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, and/or raise additional funds through the capital markets. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.</p>
<p>The Company is actively generating additional scientific and clinical data to have it published in leading industry publications. The unique features of our advanced ceramic materials are not well known, and we believe the publication of such data would help sales efforts as the Company approaches new prospects. The Company is also making additional changes to the sales strategy, including a focus on revenue growth by expanding the use of silicon nitride in other areas outside of spinal fusion applications. The Company has also acquired equipment and certain proprietary know-how for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing armored plates made from boron carbide and a composite of boron carbide and silicon carbide for military, law enforcement and other civilian uses. The addition of TA&amp;T also expands the Company's opportunity for revenue growth.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>The Company has common stock that is publicly traded and has been able to successfully raise capital when needed since the date of the Company's initial public offering in February 2014.</p>
<p>On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (as amended, the "2021 Distribution Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.7 million through Maxim, as agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2021 Distribution Agreement, as amended, Maxim will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares from time to time, based on our instructions. Under the 2021 Distribution Agreement, Maxim may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at-the-market" offering (the "ATM") as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including, without limitation, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the ATM and may at any time suspend offers under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. The Offering will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of shares having an aggregate offering price of $15.0 million, (ii) the termination by either Maxim or the Company upon the provision of fifteen (15) days written notice, or (iii) February 25, 2024. Under the terms of the 2021 Distribution Agreement, Maxim will be entitled to a transaction fee at a fixed rate of 2.0% of the gross sales price of Shares sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. The Company will also reimburse Maxim for certain expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Distribution Agreement and agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to Maxim with respect to certain liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of September 30, 2023, there have been no sales of shares of common stock under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. Because the company's public float is less than $75 million, we may not sell securities over a 12-month period in an amount greater than one-third of our public float.</p>
<p>On October 17, 2022, the Company closed on the sale of4,656 Units for gross proceeds of approximately $4.7 million pursuant to the terms of a Rights Offering to holders of the Company's common stock, Series B and Series C preferred stock and holders of certain outstanding common stock warrants (See Note 7).</p>
<p>On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of2,150,000 units with gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million (See Note 7).</p>
<p>If the Company seeks to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing, such funding is not assured and may not be available to the Company on favorable or acceptable terms and may involve significant restrictive covenants. Any additional equity financing is also not assured and, if available to the Company, will most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders. If the Company is not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis, the impact on the Company will be material and adverse.</p>
<p>These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.</p>
<p>9</p>
<h2>Grant and Contract Revenue</h2>
<p>Revenues from grants, contracts, and awards provided by governmental agencies are recorded based upon the terms of the specific agreements, which generally provide that revenue is earned when the allowable costs specified in the applicable agreement have been incurred or a milestone has been met. Cash received from federal grants, contracts, and awards can be subject to audit by the grantor and, if the examination results in a disallowance of any expenditure, repayment could be required.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted</h2>
<p>In August 2020, the Financial Statement Accounting Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2020-06 which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity. For contracts in an entity's own equity, the new guidance eliminates some of the current requirements for equity classification such as the requirement that settlement in unregistered shares is permitted. In addition, the new guidance reduces the number of accounting models that require separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments, including eliminating the requirement to recognize a beneficial conversion feature if the conversion feature is in the money and does not require bifurcation as a derivative liability. As a result, only conversion features accounted for under the substantial premium model and those that require bifurcation will be accounted for separately. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. The Company adopted the new standards January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard allows the Company in the future and, in certain circumstances, to avoid derivative treatment of warrants and avoid beneficial conversion treatment of certain convertible preferred shares.</p>
<p>New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted</p>
<p>The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that no other pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.</p>
<h2>2. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share</h2>
<p>Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period that are determined to be dilutive. Common stock equivalents are primarily comprised of preferred stock and warrants for the purchase of common stock. The Company had potentially dilutive securities, totaling approximately 1.3 million and 2.4 million as of September 30, 2023, and 2022,</p>

<h2>4. Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Financial Instruments Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis</p>
<p>The Company has issued certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which are considered derivative liabilities because they have registration rights which could require a cash settlement and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting period in accordance with accounting guidance. Fair value is based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.</li>
<li>Level 2 observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.</li>
<li>Level 3 unobservable inputs reflecting management's assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company classifies assets and liabilities measured at fair value in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. No financial assets were measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The following tables set forth the financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):</p>

Each right entitled the holder to purchase one unit, at a subscription price of $1,000 per unit, consisting of one share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 (and immediately convertible into shares of SINTX's common stock at a conversion price equal to $15.102 (the "Conversion Price"), and 66 common stock purchase warrants expiringfive years from the date of issuance, which we refer to as the Class A Warrants, and (iii) 66 common stock purchase warrants expiringthree years from the date of issuance, which we refer to as the Class B Warrants and, together with the Class A Warrants, the Warrants with each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.70 per share.</p>
<h2>2021 Equity Distribution Agreement</h2>
<p>On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (as amended, the "2021 Distribution Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.7 million through Maxim, as agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2021 Distribution Agreement, as amended, Maxim will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares from time to time, based on our instructions. Under the 2021 Distribution Agreement, Maxim may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at-the-market" offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including, without limitation, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the ATM and may at any time suspend offers under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. The Offering will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of shares having an aggregate offering price of $15.0 million, (ii) the termination by either Maxim or the Company upon the provision of fifteen (15) days written notice, or (iii) February 25, 2024. Under the terms of the 2021 Distribution Agreement, Maxim will be entitled to a transaction fee at a fixed rate of 2.0% of the gross sales price of Shares sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. The Company will also reimburse Maxim for certain expenses incurred in connection with the 2021 Distribution Agreement and agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to Maxim with respect to certain liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of September 30, 2023, there have been no sales of shares of common stock under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. Because the company's public float is less than $ 75 million, we may not sell securities over a 12-month period in an amount greater than one-third of our public float</p>

<h2>11. Subsequent Events</h2>
<h2>Lease Amendment</h2>
<p>On October 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Centrepointe Business Park Lease Agreement (the "2nd Amendment"), for its Salt Lake City, UT facility. The 2nd Amendment extends the term of lease to October 31, 2031 and expands the rental square feet by 1,230 rental square feet. The Company also has one five-year extension option and a right of first offer on additional lease space that may become available during the term of the lease.</p>
<h2>Equipment Failure</h2>
<p>On October 6, 2023, a furnace used in the Armor manufacturing operations overheated and is no longer functional. Management continues to evaluate the extent of the damage to the furnace. In addition, management is coordinating with the Company's insurance carrier and has filed a claim to cover the cost of either repairing or replacing the furnace. Further, management is working with third parties to temporarily outsource the sintering process and, therefore, does not expect a significant decrease in long-term production capacity. No assurance can be given that the Company's insurance carrier will cover the cost of repairing or replacing the furnace or that the Company will be successful in temporarily outsourcing the sintering process. Failure to obtain insurance proceeds to cover the claim or to outsource the sintering process could have an adverse effect on the operations of our armor business.</p>
<h2>National Institutes of Health Grant</h2>
<p>On October 11, 2023, the Company was awarded a Phase II grant of approximately $2.0 million by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a 3D printed composite silicon nitride - polyetheretherketone (SN-PEEK) spinal implant. The approximate $2.0 million award is to be used over two years to support research and development objectives. This represents the fourth NIH grant awarded to SINTX since the Phase I award for this project was received in September of 2021.</p>
<h2>S-3 Registration Statement</h2>
<p>On October 12, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC registering the sale, from time-totime of up to $75 million of our securities. In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company amended our equity distribution agreement with Maxim and filed a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum of $1.7 million shares of our common stock. The Company is under no obligation to sell any securities under the Shelf Registration Statement or the equity distribution agreement with Maxim.</p>
<h2>NASDAQ Notification</h2>
<p>On October 20, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department (the "Staff") of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") stating that the bid price of the Company's common stock for the last 30 consecutive trading days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).</p>
<p>The Nasdaq notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's common stock, and the stock will continue to trade uninterrupted on the The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "SINT".</p>
<p>If the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by April 17, 2024, the Company may be eligible for additional time. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, the Staff will inform the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, the Staff will provide notice that its securities will be subject to delisting.</p>
<p>The Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price for its common stock and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).</p>
<h2>Registered Offering on Form S-1 Registration Statement</h2>
<p>On October 23, 2023, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC registering the offering, on a best-efforts basis, of up to8,904,719 units (the "Units"), each consisting of one share of common stock and one Class E Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the "Class E Warrants"), at an assumed public offering price of $0.5615 per Unit, equal to the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, on October 19, 2023. The public offering</p>
<p>price for the Units in this offering will be determined at the time of pricing, and may be at a discount to the then current market price. Therefore, the assumed combined public offering price may not be indicative of the final offering price. We have engaged Maxim Group LLC as our exclusive placement agent ("Maxim" or the "placement agent") to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase our securities in this offering.</p>
<p>The foregoing description does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the notes thereto, along with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans, expectations, intentions and projections that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and any updates to those risk factors filed from time to time in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission we may make from time-to-time.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We are an advanced materials company that develops and commercializes advanced ceramics for biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. The core strength of SINTX Technologies is the manufacturing, research, and development of advanced ceramics for external partners.</p>
<p>Biomedical Applications: Since our inception, we have been focused on medical grade silicon nitride. SINTX silicon nitride products are biocompatible, bioactive, antipathogenic, and have shown superb bone affinity. Spinal implants made from SINTX silicon nitride have been successfully implanted in humans since 2008 in the US, Europe, Brazil, and Taiwan. This established use, along with its inherent resistance to bacterial adhesion and bone affinity - means that it may also be suitable in other fusion device applications such as arthroplasty implants, foot wedges, and dental implants. Bacterial infection of any biomaterial implants is always a concern. SINTX silicon nitride is inherently resistant to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, making it antibacterial. SINTX silicon nitride products can be polished to a smooth and wear-resistant surface for articulating applications, such as bearings for hip and knee replacements.</p>
<p>We believe that silicon nitride has a superb combination of properties that make it suited for long-term human implantation. Other biomaterials are based on bone grafts, metal alloys, and polymers- all of which have well-known practical limitations and disadvantages. In contrast, silicon nitride has a legacy of success in the most demanding and extreme industrial environments. As a human implant material, silicon nitride offers bone ingrowth, resistance to bacterial and viral infection, ease of diagnostic imaging, resistance to corrosion, and superior strength and fracture resistance, among other advantages, all of which claims are validated in our large and growing inventory of peer-reviewed, published literature reports. We believe that our versatile silicon nitride manufacturing expertise positions us favorably to introduce new and innovative devices in the medical and non-medical fields.</p>
<p>In June 2022, we acquired TA&amp;T, a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services. TA&amp;T has supplied ceramics for use in several biomedical applications. These products were made via 3D printing and include components for surgical instruments as well as conceptual and prototype dental implants.</p>
<p>Technical Applications: It is our belief that our silicon nitride has the best combination of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of any technical ceramic material. It is a high-performance technical ceramic with high strength, toughness, and hardness, and is extremely resistant to thermal shock and impact. It is also an electrically insulating ceramic material. Typically, it is used in applications where high load-bearing capacity, thermal stability, and wear resistance are required. Our AS9100D certification and ITAR registration have facilitated entry into the aerospace portion of this market.</p>
<p>We entered the ceramic armor market through the purchase of assets from B4C, LLC and a technology partnership with Precision Ceramics USA. We intend to develop and manufacture high-performance ceramics for personnel, aircraft, and vehicle armor including a 100% Boron Carbide material for ultimate lightweight performance in ballistic applications, and a composite material made of Boron Carbide and Silicon Carbide for exceptional multi-hit performance against ballistic threats. We have signed a 10-year lease for a building near our headquarters in Salt Lake City, UT that houses development and manufacturing activities for SINTX Armor.</p>
<p>TA&amp;T's primary area of expertise is material processing and fabrication know-how for a broad spectrum of monolithic ceramic, ceramic composite, and coating materials. Primary technologies include Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) of ceramics and metals, low-cost fabrication of fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and refractory chemical vapor deposited (CVD) coatings, transparent ceramics for ballistic armor and optical applications, and magnetron sputtered (PVD) coatings for lubrication, wear resistance and environmental barrier coatings for CMCs. TA&amp;T also provides a host of services that include 3D printing, PVDCVD coatings, material processing-CMCs, CIP, PS, HP, HIP, and material characterization for powders and finished parts-TGA/DSC, PSD. SA, Dilatometry, UV-VIS and FTIR transmission, haze and clarity.</p>
<p>Antipathogenic Applications: Today, there is a global need to improve protection against pathogens in everyday life. SINTX believes that by incorporating its unique composition of silicon nitride antipathogenic powder into products such as face masks, filters, and wound care devices, it is possible to manufacture surfaces that inactivate pathogens, thereby limiting the spread of infection and disease. The discovery in 2020 that SINTX silicon nitride inactivates SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the disease COVID-19, has opened new markets and applications for our material.</p>
<p>We presently manufacture advanced ceramic powders and components in our manufacturing facilities based in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>18</p>
<h2>Components of our Results of Operations</h2>
<p>We manage our business within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.</p>
<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>Our product revenue is derived from the manufacture and sale of products. These revenue sources include coatings, components for aerospace and medical device markets, toll processing services, and government contracts and grants. We generally recognize revenue from sales at the point in time when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is at the time the product is shipped. In general, our customers do not have rights of return or exchange.</p>
<p>We believe our product revenue will increase as we secure opportunities to manufacture third party products with silicon nitride, launch and generate revenue from our ceramic armor products, and as we continue to introduce new products and services into the market.</p>
<p>We derive grant and contract revenue from awards provided by governmental agencies.</p>
<h2>Cost of Revenue</h2>
<p>The expenses that are included in cost of revenue include all in-house manufacturing costs for the products we manufacture.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit</h2>
<p>Our gross profit measures our product revenue relative to our cost of revenue. We expect our gross profit percentage to decrease as we expand the penetration of our silicon nitride technology platform through OEM and private label partnerships, which offer additional avenues for the adoption of silicon nitride. Prior to the sale of our retail spine implant business, our revenues and gross profits were based on our retail sales. With the focus on OEM and private label partnerships, the margins are lower, thus causing the decrease in our gross profit percentage.</p>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of engineering, product development, clinical trials, test-part manufacturing, testing, developing and validating the manufacturing process, manufacturing, facility and regulatory-related costs. Research and development expenses also include employee compensation, employee and non-employee stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, consultant services, and travel and facilities expenses related to research and development activities.</p>
<p>We expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new medical devices, industrial and ceramic armor products, product candidates for antipathogenic applications, and other products which may increase our total research and development expenses.</p>
<h2>General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for certain members of our executive team and other personnel employed in finance, compliance, administrative, information technology, customer service, executive and human resource departments. General and administrative expenses also include other expenses not part of the other cost categories mentioned above, including facility expenses and professional fees for accounting and legal services.</p>

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 grant and contract revenue increase $0.6 million, or 145% as compared to the same period in 2022. The increases were primarily due to new orders for silicon nitride aerospace components and government grants and contracts in our Salt Lake City operation as well as commercial and government contract revenue in our Maryland operation.</p>
<h2>Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit</h2>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue remained relatively unchanged at $0.1 million for both 2023 and 2022. Gross profit increased $0.2 million, or 66%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase in gross profit was primarily attributed to new product mix when compared to the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue increased $0.1 million, or 44%. Gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 147%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily attributed to the increase in revenue mentioned above.</p>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses increased $1.0 million, or 66%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in patent expenses, product prototypes, outside consulting, and costs of operations associated with opening the SINTX</p>
<p>Armor facility and the acquisition of TA&amp;T.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses increased $2.2 million, or 48%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in patent expenses, employee wages, and costs of operations associated with the acquisition of TA&amp;T mid-2022.</p>
<h2>General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.1 million, or -7%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in costs for legal fees and outside consulting.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, or 14%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase is primarily due to an increase in costs for investor relations, employee wages, and employee recruiting.</p>

<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.1 million, or -14%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in costs for outside consulting.</p>
<h2>Grant and Contract Expenses</h2>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2023, grant and contract expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 62%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to a general increase in grant and contract revenue when compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, grant and contract expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 123%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to a general increase in grant and contract revenue when compared to the prior year.</p>
<h2>Other Income, Net</h2>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other income increased $0.4 million, or 514%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities and $0.1 million in interest income.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income increased $4.3 million, or 1159%, as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities, and a $0.1 million increase in interest income, offset by a $0.2 decrease in other income.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 , the Company incurred a net loss of $5.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $11.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $268.4 million and $262.5 million as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. To date, the Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, and/or raise additional funds through the capital markets. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.</p>
<p>The Company is actively generating additional scientific and clinical data to have it published in leading industry publications. We believe the publication of such data would help sales efforts as the Company approaches new prospects. The Company is also making additional changes to the sales strategy, including a focus on revenue growth by expanding the use of silicon nitride in other areas outside of spinal fusion applications. For instance, results from an independent study demonstrated the potential anti-viral properties of our silicon nitride. We believe that we may be able to apply our silicon nitride powder to personal protection products, such as face masks, gowns and gloves, resulting in inactivation of viruses that come into contact with the items.</p>
<p>The Company has common stock that is publicly traded and has been able to successfully raise capital when needed since the date of the Company's initial public offering in February 2014.</p>
<p>On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of 2,150,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one half of one Class D Warrant with each whole Class D Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds, before deducting offering expenses, totaled approximately $12.0 million. Of the $12.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $5.4 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($4.8 million net of offering costs) and approximately $6.7 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.7 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>On October 17, 2022, the Company completed a rights offering of units consisting of convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $4.7 million, after deducting expenses relating to the offering, including dealer-manager fees and expenses,</p>
<p>On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "2021 Distribution Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, shares of its our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.7 million through Maxim, as agent. No shares have been sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>On October 1, 2018, the Company sold the retail spine implant business to CTL Medical. The sale included a $6 million noninterest bearing note receivable payable over a 36-month term. CTL Medical has paid this note in full, and the Company does not expect any future cashflows associated with the note.</p>
<p>If the Company seeks to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing, such funding is not assured and may not be available to the Company on favorable or acceptable terms and may involve significant restrictive covenants. Any additional equity financing is also not assured and, if available to the Company, will most likely be dilutive</p>
<p>to its current stockholders. If the Company is not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis, the impact on the Company will be material and adverse.</p>
<p>These uncertainties create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.</p>

<h2>Net Cash Used in Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in operating activities was $11.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $8.1 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in the net loss from operations, and related non-cash add backs to the net loss, was $2.4 million from 2023 when compared to 2022. The increase in cash used for operating activities during 2023 was primarily due to the $2.4 million mentioned above plus changes in the movement of working capital items during 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 as follows: a $0.3 million increase in cash used in other liabilities, a $0.2 million increase for inventory, a $0.1 million increase in cash used for payments on operating lease liability, and a $0.1 million increase in cash used in accounts receivable, all offset by a $0.2 million decrease in cash used in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a $0.1 million decrease in cash used prepaids.</p>
<h2>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $0.8 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $0.4 million. The $0.4 million decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million decrease in purchase of property and equipment offset by a $0.3 million in cash acquired in an acquisition in 2022.</p>
<h2>Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities</h2>
<p>There was $11.4 million in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $0.5 million used in financing activities during the same period in 2022. The $12.0 million increase to net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from issuance of warrant derivative liabilities of $6.7 million, an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock of $4.8 million and a $0.5 million payment on debt in the prior year.</p>
<h2>Indebtedness</h2>
<h2>Business Loan</h2>
<p>On July 20, 2021, TA&amp;T, entered into a Loan Authorization and Agreement in the amount of approximately $350,000 (the "Business Loan"). The Company made a onetime $35,000 buy down payment when acquiring the loan. The Business Loan bore interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum. The Business Loan was secured by a general security interest in all of the assets of TA&amp;T. The Business Loan contained other standard provisions that are customary of loans of this type. The business loan was paid in full during the first quarter of 2023 and there was no outstanding balance at September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Related Party Debt</h2>
<p>TA&amp;T is obligated to repay certain personal loans made by the founders of TA&amp;T to TA&amp;T prior to SINTX's acquisition of TA&amp;T (the "Personal Loans"). The total amount of the Personal Loans at September 30, 2022 was approximately $350,000. The Company agreed to repay the outstanding balance of the Personal Loans in (i) 24 equal monthly installments beginning September 1, 2022 and each month thereafter until paid in full as one prior owner's portion of the Personal Loans totaling $157,000, and (ii) for the other owner's portion of the Personal Loans totaling $193,000. As of September 30, 2023, the related party debt had an outstanding balance of $72,000. The outstanding balance is being paid in monthly installments ending August 1, 2024. The related party debt is not collateralized and has no interest rate.</p>
<h2>Wells Fargo Line of Credit</h2>
<p>Prior to SINTX's acquisition of TA&amp;T, TA&amp;T entered into a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo. As of December 31, 2022, the line of credit with Wells Fargo had no outstanding balance.</p>

<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>A summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to those policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Significant areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for income taxes and other contingencies as well as valuation of derivative liabilities, asset impairment and collectability of accounts receivable. We use historical and other information that we consider to be relevant to make these judgments and estimates. However, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
