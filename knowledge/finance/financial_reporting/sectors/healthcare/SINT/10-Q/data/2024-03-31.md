## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

______________________________________________________________________

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SINTX Technologies, Inc. ("SINTX") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SINTX Armor, Inc. ("SINTX Armor") and Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. (TA&T), which are collectively referred to as "we" or "the Company". SINTX is an advanced ceramics company formed in December 1996, focused on providing solutions in a variety of diverse fields, including biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. SINTX is a company that has grown over time from focusing on the research and development of silicon nitride for use in human interbody implants to becoming an advanced ceramics company engaged in many different fields. The core strength of the Company is the manufacturing, research, and development of advanced ceramics for external partners. The Company presently manufactures ceramic powders and components in its Salt Lake City and Maryland facilities. The SINTX Salt Lake City facility is FDA and ANVISA registered, ISO 13485:2016 certified, and ASD9100D certified. The Company's products are primarily sold in the United States.

The Company is focused on building revenue generating opportunities in three business industries - antipathogenic, technical (including armor), and biomedical thereby connecting with current and new customers, partners and manufacturers to help realize the goal of leveraging expertise in high-tech ceramics to create new, innovative opportunities across these sectors. We expect our continued investment in research and development to provide additional revenue opportunities.

The Company's initial focus was the development and commercialization of products made from silicon nitride for use in spinal fusion and hip and knee replacement applications. SINTX believes it is the first and only manufacturer to use silicon nitride in medical applications primarily focused on spine fusion therapies. Since then, we have developed other applications for our silicon nitride technology as well as utilized our expertise in the use of ceramic materials in other applications. In July 2021, the Company acquired the equipment and obtained certain proprietary know-how rights with which it intends to develop, manufacture, and commercialize protective armor from boron carbide and a composite material of silicon carbide and boron carbide for military, law enforcement and civilian uses. The protective armor operations are housed in SINTX Armor. In June 2022, the Company acquired TA&T, a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services

On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its retail spine business to CTL Medical, a Dallas, Texas-based privately held medical device manufacturer. As a result of the sale, CTL Medical became the exclusive owner of the Company's portfolio of metal and silicon nitride spine products, as well as access to future silicon nitride spine technologies developed by the Company. The Company's name, Amedica, was also transferred to CTL Medical, which is now CTL Amedica. The Company serves as CTL's exclusive OEM provider of silicon nitride products. Manufacturing, R&D, and all intellectual property related to the core, non-spine, biomaterial technology including silicon nitride remains with the Company.

On October 30, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name to SINTX Technologies, Inc. The Company also changed its trading symbol on the NASDAQ Capital Market to "SINT".

The Company's new corporate brand reflects both the Company's core competence in the science and production of silicon nitride ceramics and other ceramics, as well as encouraging prospects for the future, as an OEM supplier of spine implants to CTL Amedica, and multiple opportunities outside of spine.

## Basis of Presentation

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and include all assets and liabilities of the Company.

SEC rules and regulations allow the omission of certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") so long as the statements are not misleading. In the opinion of management, these financial statements and accompanying notes contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company's significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of March 31, 2024, the most significant estimate relates to derivative liabilities relating to common stock warrants.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $2.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $271.6 million and $270.7 million as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. To date, the Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, and/or raise additional funds through the capital markets. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.

The Company is actively generating additional scientific and clinical data to have it published in leading industry publications. The unique features of our advanced ceramic materials are not well known, and we believe the publication of such data would help sales efforts as the Company approaches new prospects. The Company is also making additional changes to the sales strategy, including a focus on revenue growth by expanding the use of silicon nitride in other areas outside of spinal fusion applications. The Company has also acquired equipment and certain proprietary know-how for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing armored plates made from boron carbide and a composite of boron carbide and silicon carbide for military, law enforcement and other civilian uses.

The Company has common stock that is publicly traded and has been able to successfully raise capital when needed since the date of the Company's initial public offering in February 2014.

On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (as amended, the "2021 Distribution Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15 million through Maxim, as agent. On October 12, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which the expiration date of the Distribution Agreement was extended to the earlier of: (i) the sale of shares having an aggregate offering price of $15.0 million, (ii) the termination by either Maxim or the Company upon the provision of fifteen (15) days written notice, or (iii) February 25, 2025. No other changes were made to the terms of the Distribution Agreement. The Company currently has registered up to $1.1 million for sale under the Distribution Agreement, pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333274951). As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $0.07 million available for sale under the Distribution Agreement. As of March 31, 2024, there have been 2,471,949 shares of common stock sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. The Company is subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S3 which limits the amounts that we may sell under the registration statement over a 12-month period to an amount equal to or less than one-third of our public float. The shares of the Company's common stock to be sold under the Distribution Agreement will be sold and issued pursuant to the Form S-3, as amended, which was previously declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the related prospectus and one or more prospectus supplements.

On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of2,150,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one half of one Class D Warrant with each whole Class D Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds, before deducting offering expenses, totaled approximately $12.0 million. Of the $12.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $5.4 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($4.8 million net of offering costs) and approximately $6.7 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.7 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).

On February 2, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of16,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of its common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class E Warrant with each warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one Class F Warrant with each warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Each unit was sold at a public offering price of $0.25 resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $4 million before deducting offering fees and expenses. The Class E and Class F Warrants in the units will be immediately exercisable at a price of $ 0.25 per share. The Class E Warrants will expire five years from the date of issuance and the Class F Warrants will expire eighteen months from the date of issuance. Of the $ 4.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $0.6 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($0.5 million net of offering costs) and approximately $3.4 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.5 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).

On March 26, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering28,400,000 shares of the Company ' s common stock, (the " Offering " ). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $0.047. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $1.3 million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

If the Company seeks to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing, such funding is not assured and may not be available to the Company on favorable or acceptable terms and may involve significant restrictive covenants. Any additional equity financing is also not assured and, if available to the Company, will most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders. If the Company is not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis, the impact on the Company will be material and adverse. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

## Grant and Contract Revenue

Revenues from grants, contracts, and awards provided by governmental agencies are recorded based upon the terms of the specific agreements, which generally provide that revenue is earned when the allowable costs specified in the applicable agreement have been incurred or a milestone has been met. Cash received from federal grants, contracts, and awards can be subject to audit by the grantor and, if the examination results in a disallowance of any expenditure, repayment could be required.

## New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update, No. 2023-09 "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 enhances the detail that a business is required to disclose within its income tax footnote, including, but not limited to, a breakout of the rate reconciliation into more specific categories, such as state and local income tax, and foreign taxes. Additionally, a business must break out specific jurisdictions that encompass greater than or equal to 5% of their state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 on January 1, 2025. The adoption of this Standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that no other pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.

2. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

______________________________________________________________________

Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period that are determined to be dilutive. Common stock equivalents are primarily comprised of preferred stock and warrants for the purchase of common stock. The Company had potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the fully diluted loss per share calculation because they would have been antidilutive totaling approximately 18.1 million and 1.2 million as of March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

## Financial Instruments Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The Company has issued certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which are considered derivative liabilities because they have registration rights which could require a cash settlement and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting period in accordance with accounting guidance. Fair value is based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

- Level 1 quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
- Level 2 observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.
- Level 3 unobservable inputs reflecting management's assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.

The Company classifies assets and liabilities measured at fair value in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. No financial assets were measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The following tables set forth the financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

| | Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2024 | Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2024 | Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2024 | Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Common Stock Warrants

The Company has issued certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which are considered derivative liabilities because they have registration rights which could require a cash settlement and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting period in accordance with accounting guidance. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the derivative liability was calculated using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation.

The assumptions used in estimating the common stock warrant liability using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

| | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weighted-average risk-free interest rate | 4.18%-5.07 % | 3.93-4.79 % |
| Weighted-average expected life (in years) | 0.85-4.84 | 1.10-4.12 |
| Expected dividend yield | - % | - % |
| Weighted-average expected volatility | 115.0%-145.0 % | 113.1%-125.7 % |

## Other Financial Instruments

The Company's recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, account and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The recorded value of notes payable approximates the fair value as the interest rate approximates market interest rates.

## 2021 Equity Distribution Agreement

On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (as amended, the "Distribution Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15 million through Maxim, as agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, as amended, Maxim will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares from time to time, based on our instructions. Under the Distribution Agreement, Maxim may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at-themarket" offering (the "ATM") as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including, without limitation, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the ATM and may at any time suspend offers under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. On October 12, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which the expiration date of the Distribution Agreement was extended to the earlier of: (i) the sale of shares having an aggregate offering price of $15.0 million, (ii) the termination by either Maxim or the Company upon the provision of fifteen (15) days written notice, or (iii) February 25, 2025. No other changes were made to the terms of the Distribution Agreement. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, Maxim will be entitled to a transaction fee at a fixed rate of 2.0% of the gross sales price of Shares sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement. The Company will also reimburse Maxim for certain expenses incurred in connection with the Distribution Agreement and agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to Maxim with respect to certain liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

## Overview

SINTX Technologies is an advanced ceramics company formed in December 1996, focused on providing solutions in a variety of biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. We have grown from focusing primarily on the research, development and commercialization of medical devices manufactured with silicon nitride to becoming an advanced ceramics company engaged in diverse fields, including biomedical, technical and antipathogenic applications. This diversification enables us to focus on our core competencies which are the manufacturing, research, and development of products comprised from advanced ceramic materials for external partners. We seek to connect with new customers, partners and manufacturers to help them realize the goal of leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics to create new, innovative products across these sectors.

## SINTX Core Business

Biomedical Applications: Since its inception, SINTX has been focused on medical grade silicon nitride. SINTX biomedical products have been shown to be biocompatible, bioactive, antipathogenic, and to have superb bone affinity. Spinal implants made from SINTX silicon nitride have been successfully implanted in

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

humans since 2008 in the US, Europe, Brazil, and Taiwan. This established use, along with its inherent resistance to bacterial adhesion and bone affinity suggests that it may also be suitable in other fusion device applications such as arthroplasty implants, foot wedges, and dental implants. Bacterial infection of any biomaterial implants is always a concern. SINTX silicon nitride has been shown to be resistant to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, making it antibacterial. SINTX silicon nitride products can be polished to a smooth and wear-resistant surface for articulating applications, such as bearings for hip and knee replacements.

We believe that silicon nitride has a superb combination of properties that make it suited for long-term human implantation. Other biomaterials are based on bone grafts, metal alloys, and polymers- all of which have well-known practical limitations and disadvantages. In contrast, silicon nitride has a legacy of success in the most demanding and extreme industrial environments. As a human implant material, silicon nitride offers bone ingrowth, resistance to bacterial and viral infection, ease of diagnostic imaging, resistance to corrosion, and superior strength and fracture resistance, all of which claims are validated in our large and growing inventory of peerreviewed, published literature reports. We believe that our versatile silicon nitride manufacturing expertise positions us favorably to introduce new and innovative devices in the medical and non-medical fields.

In June 2022, we acquired Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. (TA&T), a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services. TA&T has supplied ceramics for use in several biomedical applications. These products were made via 3D printing and include components for surgical instruments as well as conceptual and prototype dental implants.

17

Technical Applications: It is our belief that our silicon nitride has the best combination of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of any technical ceramic material. It is a high-performance technical ceramic with high strength, toughness, and hardness, and is extremely resistant to thermal shock and impact. It is also an electrically insulating ceramic material. Typically, it is used in applications where high load-bearing capacity, thermal stability, and wear resistance are required. We have obtained AS9100D certification and ITAR registration to facilitate entry into the aerospace and protective armor markets.

We entered the ceramic armor market through the purchase of assets from B4C, LLC and a technology partnership with Precision Ceramics USA. We will develop and manufacture high-performance ceramics for personnel, aircraft, and vehicle armor including a 100% Boron Carbide material for ultimate lightweight performance in ballistic applications, and a composite material made of Boron Carbide and Silicon Carbide for exceptional multi-hit performance against ballistic threats. We have signed a 10-year lease at a building near our headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah to house development and manufacturing activities for SINTX Armor.

TA&T's primary area of expertise is material processing and fabrication know-how for a broad spectrum of monolithic ceramic, ceramic composite, and coating materials. Primary technologies include Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) of ceramics and metals, low-cost fabrication of fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and refractory chemical vapor deposited (CVD) coatings, transparent ceramics for ballistic armor and optical applications, and magnetron sputtered (PVD) coatings for lubrication, wear resistance and environmental barrier coatings for CMCs. TA&T also provides a host of services that include 3D printing, PVDCVD coatings, material processing-CMCs, CIP, PS, HP, HIP, and material characterization for powders and finished parts-TGA/DSC, PSD. SA, Dilatometry, UV-VIS and FTIR transmission, haze and clarity.

Antipathogenic Applications: Today, there is a global need to improve protection against pathogens in everyday life. SINTX believes that by incorporating its unique composition of silicon nitride antipathogenic powder into products such as face masks, filters, and wound care devices, it is possible to manufacture surfaces that inactivate pathogens, thereby limiting the spread of infection and disease. The discovery in 2020 that SINTX silicon nitride inactivates SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the disease COVID-19, has opened new markets and applications for our material.

We presently manufacture advanced ceramic powders and components in our manufacturing facilities based in Salt Lake City, Utah and Millersville, Maryland.

## Components of our Results of Operations

We manage our business within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.

## Revenue

Our product revenue is derived from the manufacture and sale of products. These revenue sources include coatings, materials, and components for aerospace and medical device markets, toll processing services, and government contracts and grants. We generally recognize revenue from sales where control transfers at a point in time as the title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is at the time the product is shipped. In general, our customer does not have rights of return or exchange.

We believe our product revenue will increase as we secure opportunities to manufacture third party products with silicon nitride, launch and generate revenue from our ceramic armor products, and as we continue to introduce new products into the market.

We derive grant and contract revenue from awards provided by governmental agencies.

## Cost of Revenue

The expenses that are included in cost of revenue include all in-house manufacturing costs for the products we manufacture.

## Gross Profit

Our gross profit measures our product revenue relative to our cost of revenue.

## Research and Development Expenses

Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of engineering, product development, clinical trials, test-part manufacturing, testing, developing and validating the manufacturing process, manufacturing, facility and regulatory-related costs. Research and development expenses also include employee compensation, employee and non-employee stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, consultant services, and travel and facilities expenses related to research and development activities.

We expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new medical devices, industrial and ceramic armor products, product candidates for antipathogenic applications, and other products which may increase our total research and development expenses.

## General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for certain members of our executive team and other personnel employed in finance, compliance, administrative, information technology, customer service, executive and human resource departments. General and administrative expenses also include other expenses not part of the other cost categories mentioned above, including facility expenses and

## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

## Revenue

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, total product revenue increase $0.1 million, or 29% as compared to the same period in 2023. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024 grant and contract revenue increase $0.1 million, or 26% as compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to new orders for silicon nitride aerospace components and government grants and contracts in our Salt Lake City operation as well as commercial and government contract revenue in our Maryland operation.

## Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, cost of revenue increased $0.1 million, or 89% as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue mentioned above.

## Research and Development Expenses

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, research and development expenses decreased $0.2 million, or -8%, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in patent expenses and outside consulting costs.

## General and Administrative Expenses

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.05 million, or -4%, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in costs for employee recruiting.

20

## Sales and Marketing Expenses

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.1 million, or -21%, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to an overall decrease in payroll related costs and costs for outside consulting.

## Grant Expenses

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, grant and contract expenses remained primarily unchanged at $0.3 million.

## Other Income, Net

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, other income decreased $1.0 million, or -29%, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in non-cash derivative expense offset by $0.8 million in offering costs associated with derivative liabilities in the prior year.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred net loss of $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $2.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $271.6 million and $270.7 million as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, and/or raise additional funds through the capital markets. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.

The Company is actively generating additional scientific and clinical data to have it published in leading industry publications. We believe the publication of such data would help sales efforts as the Company approaches new prospects. The Company is also making additional changes to the sales strategy, including a focus on revenue growth by expanding the use of silicon nitride in other areas outside of spinal fusion applications. For instance, results from an independent study demonstrated the potential anti-viral properties of our silicon nitride. We believe that we may be able to apply our silicon nitride powder to personal protection products, such as face masks, gowns and gloves, resulting in inactivation of viruses that come into contact with the items.

The Company has common stock that is publicly traded and has been able to successfully raise capital when needed since the date of the Company's initial public offering in February 2014.

On March 26, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering 28,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock, (the "Offering"). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $0.047. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $1.3 million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

On February 2, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of 16,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of its common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class E Warrant with each warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one Class F Warrant with each warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Each unit was sold at a public offering price of $0.25. The Class E and Class F Warrants in the units are immediately exercisable at a price of $0.25 per share. The Class E Warrants will expire five years from the date of issuance and the Class F Warrants will expire eighteen months from the date of issuance. Gross proceeds, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, are approximately $4.0 million.

On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of 2,150,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one half of one Class D Warrant with each whole Class D Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds, before deducting offering expenses, totaled approximately $12.0 million. Of the $12.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $5.4 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($4.8 million net of offering costs) and approximately $6.7 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.7 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).

On October 17, 2022, the Company completed a rights offering of units consisting of convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $4.7 million, after deducting expenses relating to the offering, including dealer-manager fees and expenses,

21

On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Maxim Group LLC ("Maxim"), which was subsequently amended on October 12, 2023 (as amended, the "2021 Distribution Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, shares of the Company's common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.1 million through Maxim, as agent. As of March 1, 2024, there have been 2,471,949 shares of common stock sold under the 2021 Distribution Agreement for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. In connection with the February 2024 offering, the Company agreed to not make any sales of securities under the ATM for a period of six months from the date of closing the offering, February 2, 2024, until August 2, 2024.

These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

## Cash Flows

The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands) - unaudited:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 |
| Net cash used in operating activities | $ (2,733 ) | (4,871 ) |
| Net cash used in investing activities | (173 ) | (236 ) |
| Net cash provided by financing activities | 5,328 | 11,488 |
| Net increase (decrease) in cash | $ 2,422 | 6,381 |

22

## Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $4.9 million used during the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $2.2 million. The decrease in the net loss from operations, and related non-cash add backs to the net loss, was $0.6 million from 2024 when compared to 2023. The decrease in cash used for operating activities during 2024 was primarily due to the $0.6 million mentioned above plus changes in the movement of working capital items during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as follows: a $0.7 million decrease in cash used in prepaid expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in cash used in other liabilities, a $0.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.2 million increase in cash used in accounts payable, a $0.1 million decrease in cash used for payments on operating lease liability.

## Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, remaining primarily unchanged.

## Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

There was $5.3 million in cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $11.5 million in cash provided by financing activities during the same period in 2023. The $6.2 million decrease to net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in proceeds from issuance of warrant derivative liabilities of $3.3 million and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock of $2.8 million, offset by a $0.1 million increase in payments on debt.

## Indebtedness

## Business Loan

On July 20, 2021, TA&T, entered into a Loan Authorization and Agreement in the amount of approximately $350,000 (the "Business Loan"). The Company made a onetime $35,000 buy down payment when acquiring the loan. The Business Loan bore interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum. The Business Loan was secured by a general security interest in all of the assets of TA&T. The Business Loan contained other standard provisions that are customary of loans of this type. The business loan was paid in full during the first quarter of 2023 and there was no outstanding balance at March 31, 2024.

TA&T is obligated to repay certain personal loans made by the founders of TA&T to TA&T prior to SINTX's acquisition of TA&T (the "Personal Loans"). The total amount of the Personal Loans at September 30, 2022 was approximately $350,000. The Company agreed to repay the outstanding balance of the Personal Loans in (i) 24 equal monthly installments beginning September 1, 2022 and each month thereafter until paid in full as one prior owner's portion of the Personal Loans totaling $157,000, and (ii) for the other owner's portion of the Personal Loans totaling $193,000. As of March 31, 2024, the related party debt had an outstanding balance of $26,000. The outstanding balance is being paid in monthly installments ending August 1, 2024. The related party debt is not collateralized and has no interest rate.

## Wells Fargo Line of Credit

Prior to SINTX's acquisition of TA&T, TA&T entered into a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo. As of March 31, 2024, the line of credit with Wells Fargo had no outstanding balance and the account has been closed.

23

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to those policies for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Significant areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for income taxes and other contingencies as well as valuation of derivative liabilities, asset impairment and collectability of accounts receivable. We use historical and other information that we consider to be relevant to make these judgments and estimates. However, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements.
