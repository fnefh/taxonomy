<h2>SINTX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SINTX Technologies, Inc. ("SINTX") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SINTX Armor, Inc. ("SINTX Armor") and Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. (TA&amp;T), which are collectively referred to as "we" or "the Company". SINTX is an advanced ceramics company formed in December 1996, focused on providing solutions in a variety of diverse fields, including biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. SINTX is a company that has grown over time from focusing on the research and development of silicon nitride for use in human interbody implants to becoming an advanced ceramics company engaged in many different fields. The core strength of the Company is the manufacturing, research, and development of advanced ceramics for external partners. The Company presently manufactures subtractive and additive forms of various ceramic and ceramic composite materials including silicon nitride and carbide, zirconia and alumina. SINTX has also become expert in developing proprietary powders, compounds, resins, and filaments for use in additive manufacturing along with production of finished individual components in its Salt Lake City and Maryland facilities. The SINTX Salt Lake City facility is registered with the FDA, is cGMP and ANVISA RDC 665 compliant, as well as being ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016, and ASD9100D certified. The Company's products are primarily sold in the United States.</p>
<p>The Company has historically been focused on building revenue generating opportunities in three business industries - antipathogenic, technical, and biomedical connecting with current and new customers, partners and manufacturers to help realize the goal of leveraging expertise in high-tech ceramics to create new, innovative opportunities across these sectors.</p>
<p>The Company's initial focus was the development and commercialization of products made from silicon nitride for use in spinal fusion and hip and knee replacement applications. SINTX believes it is the first and only manufacturer to use silicon nitride in medical applications primarily focused on spine fusion therapies. Since then, we have developed other medical device applications for our silicon nitride technology as well as utilized our expertise in the use of ceramic materials in other applications. In July 2021, the Company acquired the equipment and obtained certain proprietary know-how rights with the intention of developing, manufacturing, and commercializing protective armor from boron carbide and a composite material of silicon carbide and boron carbide for military, law enforcement and civilian uses. The armor plant has not been fully operational since the acquisition and the Company incurred an impairment charge of approximately $4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In June 2022, the Company acquired TA&amp;T, a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services.</p>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $9.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $7.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $280.0 million and $270.7 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We will require substantial future capital in order to continue operating our business, conduct research and development and regulatory clearance and approval activities necessary to bring our products to market, and to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities. Our existing capital resources are not sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of all our product candidates.</p>
<p>To date, the Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, decrease expenses and raise additional funding. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.</p>
<p>On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of10,750 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one half of one Class D Warrant with each whole Class D Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds, before deducting offering expenses, totaled approximately $12.0 million. Of the $12.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $5.4 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($4.8 million net of offering costs) and approximately $6.7 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.7 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>On February 2, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of80,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of its common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class E Warrant with each warrant entitled to purchase one share of common stock, and one Class F Warrant with each warrant entitled to purchase one share of common stock. Each unit was sold at a public offering price of $50.00 resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $4 million before deducting offering fees and expenses. The Class E and Class F Warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $50.00 per share. The Class E Warrants expire five years from the date of issuance and the Class F Warrants expire eighteen months from the date of issuance. Of the $4.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $0.6 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($0.5 million net of offering costs) and approximately $3.4 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.5 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).</p>
<p>On March 26, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of142,000 shares of the Company's common stock, (the "March 26 Offering"). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $9.40. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the March 26 Offering were approximately $1.3 million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of358,000 shares of the Company's common stock, (the "April 5 Offering"). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $4.20. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the April 5 Offering were approximately $1.5 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.</p>
<p>On February 25, 2021, the Company, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC (the "Agent"), as sales agent, as amended on January 10, 2023 and October 12, 2023, pursuant to which the Company could offer and sell shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), initially up to an aggregate offering price of $15,000,000, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering. On March 22, 2024, the Company suspended sales under the ATM Agreement and terminated the continuous offering. On July 11, 2024, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement with the SEC adjusting the amount available for sale under the ATM Agreement to $ 3.1 million and shortly thereafter begin offering and selling Shares under the ATM Agreement to the public. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 595,560 Shares were sold under the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $3.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 602,357 Shares were sold under the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $3.7 million. Because the Company is subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, it is restricted from selling securities in a public primary offering with a value exceeding one-third of its public float (the market value of our common stock held by our non-affiliates) in any 12-month period so long as its public float remains below $75.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was no capacity to offer and sell Shares under the ATM Agreement.</p>
<p>On June 11, 2024, the Company received formal notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") that the Company has evidenced compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule"). The Company remains subject to a "Mandatory Panel Monitor," as that term is defined in Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), for a period of one year from June 11, 2024. If, within the oneyear period, the Company fails to satisfy the minimum $1.00 closing bid price threshold for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will issue a delist determination rather than provide the Company with a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. In that event, the Company would have the opportunity to request a new hearing to address the deficiency.</p>
<p>We are actively seeking opportunities to raise additional equity and/or debt financing. However, such funding is not guaranteed and may not be available to the Company on favorable or acceptable terms and may involve significant restrictive covenants. Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, will most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders. If the Company is not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis, the impact on the Company will be material and adverse.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors, together with management, is performing an ongoing evaluation of the Company's business strategy and focus. On August 1, 2024, the board of directors appointed Eric Olson to the office of Chief Executive Officer and President to lead the evaluation process. The Board of Directors also entered into an engagement agreement with Ascendiant Partners to evaluate strategic transactions including, but not limited to, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, sell of business divisions, and reverse merger opportunities.</p>
<p>An option being evaluated is a change in strategic emphasis to advancements in the medical device sector. Historically engaged in both industrial and biomedical applications, SINTX would prioritize the development and commercialization of innovative medical devices, leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics and biomaterials. Such a renewed focus would align with a commitment to improving patient outcomes through the creation of products designed for surgical, orthopedic, and other specialized medical applications. We would concentrate our resources on high-growth areas within the healthcare sector where our proprietary materials and technologies-such as silicon nitride-provide a distinct competitive advantage due to their unique strength, durability, and biocompatibility.</p>
<p>Through this transformation, SINTX's aim would be to deliver meaningful innovations to the medical community. Our current research and development pipeline is centered on medical-grade devices that incorporate antimicrobial properties, enhanced imaging capabilities, and durability under physiological conditions, which are critical for orthopedic implants, spinal fusion devices, and other surgical tools. If we transition away from industrial applications, we anticipate this strategic shift will enable us to better serve the medical sector, address critical unmet needs, and position SINTX as a leading provider in the medical device market. By focusing on partnerships and collaborations with healthcare institutions and industry leaders, SINTX is positioned to expand its footprint in the medical device sector and drive shareholder value through sustainable, high-impact innovations, however, such a transition has not been approved by the Board of Directors, nor can such approval or successful transition be assured.</p>
<p>SINTX Technologies has initiated discussions with the leaseholder for our Centerpointe location in Salt Lake City, Utah to explore options for reducing the Company's overall lease liability. This action aligns with our broader strategy to streamline operating expenses and the option to reallocate resources towards growth initiatives in the medical device sector. While these discussions reflect our commitment to financial optimization, there can be no assurance that negotiations will lead to a reduction in the existing lease liability. The outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, and SINTX will continue to evaluate additional measures to manage long-term obligations in alignment with our strategic objectives.</p>
<p>On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a Company-wide reduction in the workforce. This decision is part of the Company's ongoing strategic review of its operations aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. The reduction in force reduced the number of employees of the Company from 40 to 23. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded expenses of approximately $0.4 million associated with the reduction in workforce.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to cease efforts to make the armor plant operational. This decision was made to streamline operations and focus on core business areas that align with the Company's long-term strategic goals. The armor plant has not been fully operational since the acquisition of the armor equipment in July 2021 and has been completely shut down since October 2023 due to the malfunctioning of the sintering furnace. In connection with this decision the Company incurred an impairment charge of approximately $4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This charge primarily relates to the write-down of certain long-lived assets associated with the armor plant to their estimated fair value.</p>
<p>The Company's insurance carrier has determined that a covered loss occurred when the sintering furnace malfunctioned, and coverage is available for the Company's repair of the sintering furnace. However, the Company's efforts to fully repair the damaged furnace continue to be delayed. Management will work with the insurance company to continue to fund the repair of the furnace. When the furnace is fully repaired, management intends to sell the furnace, and related equipment, to a third party. However, the full repair and sale of the furnace, and related equipment, cannot be assured. Therefore, in the calculation of the $4.5 million estimated impairment charge, management has assumed no proceeds will be received from a potential sale of the furnace and related equipment.</p>
<p>These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.</p>
<p>10</p>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and include all assets and liabilities of the Company.</p>
<p>SEC rules and regulations allow the omission of certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") so long as the statements are not misleading. In the opinion of management, these financial statements and accompanying notes contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented herein. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company's significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Reverse Stock Split</h2>
<p>On May 28, 2024, the Company effected a 1 for 200 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock. The par value and the authorized shares of the common and preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All common stock shares, equivalents, and per-share amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, the most significant estimate relates to derivative liabilities relating to common stock warrants.</p>
<p>11</p>
<h2>Grant and Contract Revenue</h2>
<p>Revenues from grants, contracts, and awards provided by governmental agencies are recorded based upon the terms of the specific agreements, which generally provide that revenue is earned when the allowable costs specified in the applicable agreement have been incurred or a milestone has been met. Cash received from federal grants, contracts, and awards can be subject to audit by the grantor and, if the examination results in a disallowance of any expenditure, repayment could be required.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update, No. 2023-09 "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 enhances the detail that a business is required to disclose within its income tax footnote, including, but not limited to, a breakout of the rate reconciliation into more specific categories, such as state and local income tax, and foreign taxes. Additionally, a business must break out specific jurisdictions that encompass greater than or equal to 5% of their state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 on January 1, 2025. The adoption of this Standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.</p>
<p>The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that no other pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.</p>
<h2>2. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share</h2>
<p>Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period that are determined to be dilutive. Common stock equivalents are primarily comprised of preferred stock and warrants for the purchase of common stock. The Company had potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the fully diluted loss per share calculation because they would have been antidilutive totaling approximately 71 thousand and 6 thousand as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.</p>

<h2>4. Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Financial Instruments Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis</p>
<p>The Company has issued certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which are considered derivative liabilities because they have certain rights which could require a cash settlement and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting period in accordance with accounting guidance. Fair value is based on the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.</li>
<li>Level 2 observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.</li>
<li>Level 3 unobservable inputs reflecting management's assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company classifies assets and liabilities measured at fair value in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. No financial assets or liabilities (except the derivative liabilities explained above) were measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following tables set forth the financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):</p>

<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the notes thereto, along with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon current beliefs, plans, expectations, intentions and projections that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and any updates to those risk factors filed from time to time in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission we may make from time-to-time.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SINTX Technologies is an advanced ceramics company formed in December 1996, focused on providing solutions in a variety of biomedical, technical, and antipathogenic applications. We have grown from focusing primarily on the research, development and commercialization of medical devices manufactured with silicon nitride to becoming an advanced ceramics company engaged in diverse fields, including biomedical, technical and antipathogenic applications. This diversification</p>
<p>enables us to focus on our core competencies which are the manufacturing, research, and development of products comprised from advanced ceramic materials for external partners. We seek to connect with new customers, partners and manufacturers to help them realize the goal of leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics to create new, innovative products across these sectors.</p>
<h2>SINTX Core Business</h2>
<p>Biomedical Applications: Since its inception, SINTX has been focused on medical grade silicon nitride. SINTX biomedical products have been shown to be biocompatible, bioactive, antipathogenic, and to have superb bone affinity. Spinal implants made from SINTX silicon nitride have been successfully implanted in humans since 2008 in the US, Europe, Brazil, and Taiwan. This established use, along with its inherent resistance to bacterial adhesion and bone affinity suggests that it may also be suitable in other fusion device applications such as arthroplasty implants, foot wedges, and dental implants. Bacterial infection of any biomaterial implants is always a concern. SINTX silicon nitride has been shown to be resistant to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, making it antibacterial. SINTX silicon nitride products can be polished to a smooth and wear-resistant surface for articulating applications, such as bearings for hip and knee replacements.</p>
<p>We believe that silicon nitride has a superb combination of properties that make it suited for long-term human implantation. Other biomaterials are based on bone grafts, metal alloys, and polymers- all of which have well-known practical limitations and disadvantages. In contrast, silicon nitride has a legacy of success in the most demanding and extreme industrial environments. As a human implant material, silicon nitride offers bone ingrowth, resistance to bacterial and viral infection, ease of diagnostic imaging, resistance to corrosion, and superior strength and fracture resistance, all of which claims are validated in our large and growing inventory of peerreviewed, published literature reports. We believe that our versatile silicon nitride manufacturing expertise positions us favorably to introduce new and innovative devices in the medical and non-medical fields.</p>
<p>In June 2022, we acquired Technology Assessment and Transfer, Inc. (TA&amp;T), a nearly 40-year-old business with a mission to transition advanced materials and process technologies from a laboratory environment to commercial products and services. TA&amp;T has supplied ceramics for use in several biomedical applications. These products were made via 3D printing and include components for surgical instruments as well as conceptual and prototype dental implants.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Technical Applications: It is our belief that our silicon nitride has the best combination of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of any technical ceramic material. It is a high-performance technical ceramic with high strength, toughness, and hardness, and is extremely resistant to thermal shock and impact. It is also an electrically insulating ceramic material. Typically, it is used in applications where high load-bearing capacity, thermal stability, and wear resistance are required. We have obtained AS9100D certification and ITAR registration to facilitate entry into the aerospace and protective armor markets.</p>
<p>TA&amp;T's primary area of expertise is material processing and fabrication know-how for a broad spectrum of monolithic ceramic, ceramic composite, and coating materials. Primary technologies include Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) of ceramics and metals, low-cost fabrication of fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and refractory chemical vapor deposited (CVD) coatings, transparent ceramics for ballistic armor and optical applications, and magnetron sputtered (PVD) coatings for lubrication, wear resistance and environmental barrier coatings for CMCs. TA&amp;T also provides a host of services that include 3D printing, PVDCVD coatings, material processing-CMCs, CIP, PS, HP, HIP, and material characterization for powders and finished parts-TGA/DSC, PSD. SA, Dilatometry, UV-VIS and FTIR transmission, haze and clarity.</p>
<p>Antipathogenic Applications: Today, there is a global need to improve protection against pathogens in everyday life. SINTX believes that by incorporating its unique composition of silicon nitride antipathogenic powder into products such as face masks, filters, and wound care devices, it is possible to manufacture surfaces that inactivate pathogens, thereby limiting the spread of infection and disease. The discovery in 2020 that SINTX silicon nitride inactivates SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the disease COVID-19, has opened new markets and applications for our material.</p>
<p>We presently manufacture advanced ceramic powders and components in our manufacturing facilities based in Salt Lake City, Utah and Millersville, Maryland.</p>
<h2>Components of our Results of Operations</h2>
<p>We manage our business within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, makes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.</p>
<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>Our product revenue is derived from the manufacture and sale of products. These revenue sources include coatings, materials, and components for aerospace and medical device markets, toll processing services, and government contracts and grants. We generally recognize revenue from sales where control transfers at a point in time as the title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is at the time the product is shipped. In general, our customer does not have rights of return or exchange.</p>
<p>We derive grant and contract revenue from awards provided by governmental agencies. The goal of these grants and contracts is ultimately to develop revenue producing products.</p>
<p>21</p>
<h2>Cost of Revenue</h2>
<p>The expenses that are included in cost of revenue include all in-house manufacturing costs for the products we manufacture.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit</h2>
<p>Our gross profit measures our product revenue relative to our cost of revenue.</p>
<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of engineering, product development, clinical trials, test-part manufacturing, testing, developing and validating the manufacturing process, manufacturing, facility and regulatory-related costs. Research and development expenses also include employee compensation, employee and non-employee stock-based compensation, supplies and materials, consultant services, and travel and facilities expenses related to research and development activities.</p>
<p>We expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to develop new medical devices, industrial and ceramic armor products, product candidates for antipathogenic applications, and other products which may increase our total research and development expenses.</p>
<h2>General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for certain members of our executive team and other personnel employed in finance, compliance, administrative, information technology, customer service, executive and human resource departments. General and administrative expenses also include other expenses not part of the other cost categories mentioned above, including facility expenses and</p>
<p>professional fees for accounting and legal services.</p>

This decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease associated with the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities, offset by a $0.2 million increase in costs associated with derivative liabilities.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $9.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $7.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $280.0 million and $270.7 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We will require substantial future capital in order to continue operating our business, conduct research and development and regulatory clearance and approval activities necessary to bring our products to market, and to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities. Our existing capital resources are not sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of all our product candidates.</p>
<p>To date, the Company's operations have been principally financed from proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and, to a lesser extent, cash generated from product sales. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase sales, decrease expenses and raise additional funding. Whether and when the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations or obtain additional financing is uncertain.</p>
<p>On February 10, 2023, the Company closed on a public offering of 10,750 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one half of one Class D Warrant with each whole Class D Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds, before deducting offering expenses, totaled approximately $12.0 million. Of the $12.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $5.4 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($4.8 million net of offering costs) and approximately $6.7 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.7 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>On February 2, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of 80,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of its common stock, or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of its common stock, one Class E Warrant with each warrant entitled to purchase one share of common stock, and one Class F Warrant with each warrant entitled to purchase one share of common stock. Each unit was sold at a public offering price of $50.00 resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $4 million before deducting offering fees and expenses. The Class E and Class F Warrants were immediately exercisable at a price of $50.00 per share. The Class E Warrants expire five years from the date of issuance and the Class F Warrants expire eighteen months from the date of issuance. Of the $4.0 million of gross proceeds, approximately $0.6 million were allocated to common stock and prefunded warrants ($0.5 million net of offering costs) and approximately $3.4 million were allocated to derivative liabilities (with approximately $0.5 million of cash offering costs and $0.1 million of agent warrant offering costs recorded as derivative expense).</p>
<p>On March 26, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of 142,000 shares of the Company's common stock, (the "March 26 Offering"). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $9.40. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the March 26 Offering were approximately $1.3 million before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2024, the Company closed on a public offering of 358,000 shares of the Company's common stock, (the "April 5 Offering"). Each Share was sold at a public offering price of $4.20. The aggregate proceeds to the Company from the April 5 Offering were approximately $1.5 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.</p>
<p>On February 25, 2021, the Company, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with Maxim Group LLC (the "Agent"), as sales agent, as amended on January 10, 2023 and October 12, 2023, pursuant to which the Company could offer and sell shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), initially up to an aggregate offering price of $15,000,000, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering. On March 22, 2024, the Company suspended sales under the ATM Agreement and terminated the continuous offering. On July 11, 2024, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement with the SEC adjusting the amount available for sale under the ATM Agreement to $3.1 million and shortly thereafter begin offering and selling Shares under the ATM Agreement to the public. During the three months ended September 2024, 595,560 Shares were sold under the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $3.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 602,357 Shares were sold under the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $3.7 million. Because the Company is subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, it is restricted from selling securities in a public primary offering with a value exceeding one-third of its public float (the market value of our common stock held by our non-affiliates) in any 12-month period so long as its public float remains below $75.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was no capacity to offer and sell Shares under the ATM Agreement.</p>
<p>On June 11, 2024, the Company received formal notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") that the Company has evidenced compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule"). The Company remains subject to a "Mandatory Panel Monitor," as that term is defined in Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), for a period of one year from June 11, 2024. If, within the oneyear period, the Company fails to satisfy the minimum $1.00 closing bid price threshold for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will issue a delist determination rather</p>
<p>than provide the Company with a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. In that event, the Company would have the opportunity to request a new hearing to address the deficiency.</p>
<p>We are actively seeking opportunities to raise additional equity and/or debt financing. However, such funding is not guaranteed and may not be available to the Company on favorable or acceptable terms and may involve significant restrictive covenants. Any additional equity financing, if available to the Company, will most likely be dilutive to its current stockholders. If the Company is not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on a timely basis, the impact on the Company will be material and adverse.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors, together with management, is performing an ongoing evaluation of the Company's business strategy and focus. On August 1, 2024, the board of directors appointed Eric Olson to the office of Chief Executive Officer and President to lead the evaluation process. The Board of Directors also entered into an engagement agreement with Ascendiant Partners to evaluate strategic transactions including, but not limited to, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, sell of business divisions, and reverse merger opportunities.</p>
<p>An option being evaluated is a change in strategic emphasis to advancements in the medical device sector. Historically engaged in both industrial and biomedical applications, SINTX would prioritize the development and commercialization of innovative medical devices, leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics and biomaterials. Such a renewed focus would align with a commitment to improving patient outcomes through the creation of products designed for surgical, orthopedic, and other specialized medical applications. We would concentrate our resources on high-growth areas within the healthcare sector where our proprietary materials and technologies-such as silicon nitride-provide a distinct competitive advantage due to their unique strength, durability, and biocompatibility.</p>
<p>Through this transformation, SINTX's aim would be to deliver meaningful innovations to the medical community. Our current research and development pipeline is centered on medical-grade devices that incorporate antimicrobial properties, enhanced imaging capabilities, and durability under physiological conditions, which are critical for orthopedic implants, spinal fusion devices, and other surgical tools. If we transition away from industrial applications, we anticipate this strategic shift will enable us to better serve the medical sector, address critical unmet needs, and position SINTX as a leading provider in the medical device market. By focusing on partnerships and collaborations with healthcare institutions and industry leaders, SINTX is positioned to expand its footprint in the medical device sector and drive shareholder value through sustainable, high-impact innovations, however, such a transition has not been approved by the Board of Directors, nor can such approval or successful transition be assured.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>SINTX Technologies has initiated discussions with the leaseholder for our Centerpointe location in Salt Lake City, Utah to explore options for reducing the Company's overall lease liability. This action aligns with our broader strategy to streamline operating expenses and the option to reallocate resources towards growth initiatives in the medical device sector. While these discussions reflect our commitment to financial optimization, there can be no assurance that negotiations will lead to a reduction in the existing lease liability. The outcome of these discussions remains uncertain, and SINTX will continue to evaluate additional measures to manage long-term obligations in alignment with our strategic objectives.</p>
<p>On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a Company-wide reduction in the workforce. This decision is part of the Company's ongoing strategic review of its operations aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. The reduction in force reduced the number of employees of the Company from 40 to 23. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded expenses of approximately $407,000 associated with the reduction in workforce.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to cease efforts to make the armor plant operational. This decision was made to streamline operations and focus on core business areas that align with the Company's long-term strategic goals. The armor plant has not been fully operational since the acquisition of the armor equipment in July 2021 and has been completely shut down since October 2023 due to the malfunctioning of the sintering furnace. In connection with this decision the Company incurred an impairment charge of approximately $4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This charge primarily relates to the write-down of certain long-lived assets associated with the armor plant to their estimated fair value.</p>
<p>The Company's insurance carrier has determined that a covered loss occurred when the sintering furnace malfunctioned, and coverage is available for the Company's repair of the sintering furnace. However, the Company's efforts to fully repair the damaged furnace continue to be delayed. Management will work with the insurance company to continue to fund the repair of the furnace. When the furnace is fully repaired, management intends to sell the furnace, and related equipment, to a third party. However, the full repair and sale of the furnace, and related equipment, cannot be assured. Therefore, in the calculation of the $4.5 million estimated impairment charge, management has assumed no proceeds will be received from a potential sale of the furnace and related equipment.</p>
<p>These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.</p>

The decrease in the net loss from operations, and related non-cash add backs to the net loss, was $2.6 million from 2024 when compared to 2023. The decrease in cash used for operating activities during 2024 was primarily due to the $2.6 million mentioned above plus changes in the movement of working capital items during 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as follows: a $0.5 million decrease in cash used for inventory, a $0.5 million decrease in cash used in prepaid expenses, a $0.4 million decrease in cash used in other liabilities, a $0.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.2 million decrease in payments on operating lease liability, all offset by a $1.0 million increase in cash used in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.</p>

<p>There was $9.2 million in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.4 million in cash provided by financing activities during the same period in 2023.

<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>A summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to those policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Significant areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for income taxes and other contingencies as well as valuation of derivative liabilities, asset impairment and collectability of accounts receivable. We use historical and other information that we consider to be relevant to make these judgments and estimates. However, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>

<h2>PART II</h2>
<h2>ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p>We are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. The medical device industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper hiring practices. As a result, we may be involved in various additional legal proceedings from time to time.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<h2>The Company may not be successful in its efforts to transition it focus to advancements in the medical device sector</h2>
<p>The Company is focusing its strategic efforts to emphasize advancements in the medical device sector. SINTX is now prioritizing the development and commercialization of innovative medical devices, leveraging our expertise in advanced ceramics and biomaterials. There can be no assurance that SINTX will be successful in these efforts. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.</p>
<h2>Our success will depend on our acquiring revenue generating assets. We may not be successful in acquiring revenue generating assets which will impact our ability fund operations.</h2>
<p>To accelerate this transformation, SINTX is also actively exploring the acquisition of revenue-generating assets that will strengthen our position in the medical device field. These acquisitions are aimed at diversifying our product offerings, expanding market reach, Further, Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC was retained to assist in identifying strategic business opportunities that align with our renewed focus on the medical device sector. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.</p>
<h2>The delay in the divesture of our armor, aerospace and defense segments could delay development of our medical device focus resulting in a delay in future revenue.</h2>
<p>We are pursuing the sale of our armor, aerospace, and defense segments, Divesting these industrial applications will allow us to reallocate resources and capital toward the high-growth medical device sector. Any delay in such divestitures will impact adversely on our reallocation of resources and capital toward the medical device sector. If we fail in any of these endeavors or experience delays in pursuing them, we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated.</p>
<h2>The August 8, 2024 reduction in force may result in the Company not having the necessary personnel to pursue its strategic objectives.</h2>
<p>On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a Company-wide reduction in the workforce. This decision is part of the Company's ongoing strategic review of its operations aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. The reduction in force reduced the number of employees of the Company from 40 to 23. As a result we may not have sufficient personnel to effectuate our business strategy. The members of our current senior management team may not be able to successfully implement our strategy. There are no assurances that the services of any of these individuals will be available to us for any specified period of time. The successful integration of our senior management team, the loss of members of our senior management team, engineering team and key external advisors, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
