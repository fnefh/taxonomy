## NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Organization and Description of Business

Teladoc Health, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as "Teladoc Health," or the "Company," and is the global leader in whole person virtual care focusing on forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes, and value around the world. The Company's mission is to empower all people everywhere to live their healthiest lives by transforming the healthcare experience.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Texas in June 2002 and changed its state of incorporation to the State of Delaware in October 2008. Effective August 10, 2018, Teladoc, Inc. changed its corporate name to Teladoc Health, Inc. The Company's principal executive office is located in Purchase, New York.

## Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accr uals) necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Teladoc Health for the periods presented. However, the financial results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year or for any other future period.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States ("U.S.") have been omitted or condensed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The information in this report should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the "2022 Form 10-K"), which includes a complete set of footnote disclosures, including the Company's significant accounting policies.

These consolidated financial statements include the results of Teladoc Health, as wellas t wo professional associations and 10 professional corporations (collectively, the "THMG Association").

Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A., formerly Teladoc Physicians, P.A. ("THMG"), is party to a Services Agreement by and among it and the professional associations and professional corporations pursuant to which each professional association and professional corporation provides services to THMG. Each professional association and professional corporation is established pursuant to the requirements of its respective domestic jurisdiction governing the corporate practice of medicine.

The Company holds a variable interest in the THMG Association, which contracts with physicians and other health professionals in order to provide services to Teladoc Health. The THMG Association is considered a variable interest entity ("VIE") since it does not have sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. An enterprise having a controlling financial interest in a VIE must consolidate the VIE if it has both power and benefits-that is, it has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). The Company has the power and rights to control all activities of the THMG Association and funds and absorbs all losses of the VIE and appropriately consolidates the THMG Association.

Total revenue and net loss for the VIE were $56.1 million and $0.0 million, and $57.5 million and $1.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total revenue and net loss for the VIE were $176.6 million and $0.0 million, and $176.9 million and $3.9 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VIE's total assets, all of which were current, were $263.5 million and $106.7 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The VIE's total liabilities, all of which were current, were $312.1 million and $143.8 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The VIE's total stockholders' deficit was $48.6 million and $37.1 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business and economic factors, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in the Company's business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment evolves. The Company believes that estimates used in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Significant estimates and assumptions by management affect areas including the value and useful life of long-lived assets (including intangible assets), the value of goodwill, the capitalization and amortization of software development costs, deferred device and contract costs, allowances for sales and for doubtful accounts, and the accounting for business combinations. Other significant areas include revenue recognition (including performance guarantees and claims adjustments), the accounting for income taxes, contingencies, litigation and related legal accruals, the accounting for stock-based compensation awards, and other items as described in the Summary of Significant Accounting policies in this Quarterly Report and in the 2022 Form 10-K.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In September 2022, the financial accounting standards board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-04, "Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations," to provide guidance on disclosure requirements for supplier finance programs and improve information transparency by requiring the disclosure of key terms of the program, amounts outstanding that remain unpaid, a description of where those amounts are presented in the balance sheet, and a roll forward of any outstanding obligations. ASU 2022-04 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-04 did not have any impact on the Company's financial information.

## Note 3. Revenue, Deferred Revenue, and Deferred Device and Contract Costs

The Company generates access fees from customers, which primarily consist of employers, health plans, hospitals and health systems, insurance and financial services companies (collectively "Clients"), as well as individual members who utilize the Company's solutions, accessing its professional provider network, hosted virtual healthcare platform, and chronic care management platforms. Visit fee revenue is generated for general medical, expert medical service, and other specialty visits and is reported as a component of other revenue when disaggregated revenue is presented. Revenue associated with virtual healthcare device equipment sales included with the Company's hosted virtual healthcare platform is also reported in other revenue.

The following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated by revenue source and also by geography (in thousands):

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company refined its definition of other revenue to capture revenues associated with visit fee, virtual healthcare device equipment sales, and its hosted virtual healthcare platform. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with the current presentation.

## Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue represents billed, but unrecognized revenue, and is comprised of fees received in advance of the delivery or completion of the services and amounts received in instances when revenue recognition criteria have not been met. The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of the Company's performance obligation to provide services. Deferred revenue is derived from 1) upfront payments for a device, which is amortized ratably over the expected member enrollment period; 2) upfront payments for certain services where payment is required for future periods before the service is delivered to the member, which is recognized when the services are provided; and 3) upfront payments from third-party financing companies with whom the Company works to provide certain Clients with a rental option, which is recognized over the rental period. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the next twelve-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenue.

Deferred revenue, current plus long-term, was $112.3 million at September 30, 2023, a net decrease of $1.4 million from December 31, 2022, and $111.3 million at September 30, 2022, a net increase of $9.3 million from December 31, 2021. These changes were driven by increased cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, offset by revenue recognized that had been included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period. The amount of revenue recognized in the periods that was included in the opening current deferred revenue was $88.6 million and $68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company expects to recognize $65.3 million of revenue throughout the remainder of 2023, $36.1 million of revenue in the year ending December 31, 2024, and the remaining balance thereafter related to future performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of September 30, 2023.

## Note 4. Fair Value Measurements

The carrying value of the Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy that requires it to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

A financial instrument's classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2-Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.

The Company measures its cash equivalents at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company classifies its cash equivalents within Level 1 because they are valued using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets in active markets and quoted prices directly in active markets.

The following tables present information about the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the above input categories (in thousands):

All of the Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company's liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by the Company's subsidiaries.

Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the applicable conversion date only under the following circumstances:

- · during any quarter (and only during such quarter), if the last reported sale price of the shares of Company's common stock for at least20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to130% of the conversion price for the applicable Notes on each applicable trading day;
- · during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (orfive consecutive trading day period in the case of the Livongo Notes) in which the trading price was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Company's common stock and the conversion rate for the applicable Notes on each such trading day;
- · upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described under the applicable indenture; or
- · if the Company calls the applicable Notes for redemption, at any time until the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the redemption date.

On or after the applicable conversion date, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of such Notes, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

The 2027 Notes and the 2025 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the applicable conversion rate shown in the table above. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. If the Company elects to satisfy the conversion obligation solely in cash or through payment and delivery, as the case may be, of a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, the amount of cash and shares of the Company's common stock due

upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in a25 consecutive trading day observation period.

The Livongo Notes are convertible at the applicable conversion rate shown in the table above into "units of reference property," each of which is comprised of0.592 of a share of the Company's common stock and $4.24 in cash, without interest. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, units of reference property, or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. If the Company elects to satisfy the conversion obligation solely in cash or through payment and delivery, as the case may be, of a combination of cash and units of reference property, the amount of cash and units of reference property, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in a 40 consecutive trading day observation period.

For each Note series, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes, at its option, on or after the applicable optional redemption date shown in the table above (and prior to the 41 scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date in the case of the Livongo Notes) if the last reported sale price of its common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of the redemption. The redemption price will be the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, calling any 2027 Note or 2025 Note for redemption on or after the applicable optional redemption date will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note, if it is converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances as described in the applicable indenture. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture) at any time prior to the maturity date of the Livongo Notes, holders will have the right, at their option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Livongo Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Livongo Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. st

The Company accounts for each Note series at amortized cost within the liability section of its condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has reserved an aggregate of 8.7 million shares of common stock for the Notes.

## Note 11. Leases

The Company has operating leases for facilities, hosting co-location facilities, and certain equipment under non-cancelable leases in the U.S. and various international locations. The leases have remaining lease terms of less than one to nine years, with options to extend the lease term fromone to five years. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is, or contains, a lease based on the terms covering the right to use property, plant or equipment for a stated period of time. For new and amended leases beginning in 2020 and after, the Company separately allocates the lease (e.g., fixed lease payments for right-to-use land, building, etc.) and non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance) for its leases.

The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases in the U.S. and various international locations.The future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (in thousands):

The Company rents certain information systems to selected qualified customers under arrangements that qualify as either sales-type lease or operating lease arrangements. Leases have terms that generally range from two to five years.

The Company recorded certain restructuring costs related to lease impairments and the related charges due to the abandonment and/or exit of excess leased office space. However, the lease liabilities related to these spaces remain an outstanding obligation of the Company as of September 30, 2023. See Note. 12, "Restructuring," for further information.

## Note 12. Restructuring

The Company has substantially completed the previously reported actions to restructure its operations to reduce operating costs. The Company accounts for restructuring costs in accordance with ASC Subtopic 420-10, "Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations" and ASC Section 360-10-35, "Property, Plant and Equipment-Subsequent Measurement." The costs are recorded to the "Restructuring costs" line item within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss as they are recognized.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $0.4 million of restructuring costs, of which $0.2 million was related to adjustments for severance estimates and $0.2 million was related to adjustments for estimates related to the reduction of office space. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $16.0 million of restructuring costs, of which $7.9 million was related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and related costs and $8.1 million was related to costs associated with office space reductions, including $4.9 million of right-of-use asset impairment charges. The portion of these amounts to be settled by cash disbursements was accounted for as a restructuring liability under the line item "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The table below summarizes the accrual and charges incurred with respect to the Company's restructuring, with the severance related portion included in the line item "Accrued compensation" and the lease termination related portion

included in the line item "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands):

## Note 13. Common Stock and Stockholders' Equity

## Stock Plans

The Company's 2023 Incentive Award Plan and 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (collectively, the "2023 Plans") provide for the issuance of incentive and non-statutory options and other equity-based awards to its employees and non-employee service providers. Previously, the Company's 2015 Incentive Award Plan, 2017 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan and Livongo Acquisition Incentive Award Plan (together with the 2023 Plans, collectively, the "Plans") also provided for the issuance of such awards. The Company had 14,658,357 shares available for grant under the 2023 Plans at September 30, 2023.

All stock-based awards to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value, or replacement grant date fair value in relation to the Livongo transaction, and are generally recognized on a straight line basis in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award (generally requiring a four-year vesting period for each stock option and athree-year vesting period for each restricted stock unit ("RSU")). The Company recognizes the forfeiture of stock-based awards as they occur.

## Stock Options

Options issued under the Plans are exercisable for periods not to exceed10 years, and vest and contain such other terms and conditions as specified in the applicable award document. Options to buy common stock are issued under the Plans, with exercise prices equal to the closing price of shares of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of award.

Stock option activity under the Plans was as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts and years):

The total grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $1.2 million and $24.9 million, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The assumptions used are determined as follows:

Volatility. The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of the Company's stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants.

Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. When establishing the expected term assumption, the Company utilizes historical data.

Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the expected term on the options.

Dividend Yield. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, it used an expected dividend yield of zero.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:

## Performance Stock Units

Stock-based compensation costs associated with the Company's RSUs subject to performance criteria ("PSUs") are initially determined using the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the awards are granted (service inception date). The vesting of these PSUs is subject to certain performance conditions and a service requirement ranging from 1 year to 3 years. Stock-based compensation costs associated with these PSUs are re-assessed each reporting period based upon the estimated performance attainment on the reporting date until the performance conditions are met. The ultimate number of PSUs that are issued to an employee is the result of the actual performance of the Company at the end of the performance period compared to the performance targets and gener ally r anges from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Stock compensation expense for PSUs is recognized on an accelerated tranche by tranche basis for performance-based awards.

PSU activity under the Plans was as follows:

## Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In July 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") in connection with its initial public offering. At the Company's 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance under the ESPP by 3,000,000.

The Company's ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

payroll deductions during defined offering periods. Under the ESPP, the Company may specify offerings with durations of not more than27 months and may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of its common stock will be purchased for employees participating in the offering. An offering may be terminated under certain circumstances. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or on the date of purchase.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company didnot issue any shares under the ESPP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 271,736 shares and 148,609 shares, respectively, under the ESPP.

## Note 14. Provision for Income Taxes

The Company recorded income tax benefits of $2.5 million and $2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The tax benefits recorded were the result of the current period book loss, primarily offset by valuation allowances and the tax shortfall associated with the stock-based compensation awards that vested in the year.

The Company recorded income tax benefits of $1.2 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.

## Note 15. Legal Matters

From time to time, Teladoc Health is involved in various litigation matters arising in the normal course of business, including the matters described below. The Company consults with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to such matters. Estimating the probable losses or a range of probable losses resulting from litigation, government actions, and other legal proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve discretionary amounts, present novel legal theories, are in the early stages of the proceedings, or are subject to appeal. Whether any losses, damages, or remedies ultimately resulting from such matters could reasonably have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the timing and amount of such losses or damages (if any) and the structure and type of any such remedies. As of the date of these financial statements, Teladoc Health's management does not expect any litigation matter to have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

On August 27, 2021, a purported securities class action complaint (City of Hialeah Employees' Retirement System v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et.al.) was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against the Company and certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors. The complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons who acquired shares of Teladoc Health common stock issued in the Company's 2020 merger with Livongo. The complaint asserted violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act based on allegedly false or misleading statements and omissions with respect to the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with the Livongo merger. The complaint sought certification as a class action, unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and attorneys' fees, rescission or a rescissory measure of damages and equitable or other relief. On January 18, 2022, the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois and on January 26, 2022, was refiled in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The refiled case includes substantially the same allegations. On August 23, 2023, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.

On June 6, 2022, a purported securities class action complaint (Schneider v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et. al.) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of the Company's officers. The complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of the Company's common stock during the period October 28, 2021 through April 27, 2022. The complaint asserted violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder based on allegedly false or misleading statements and omissions with respect to, among other things, the Company's business, operations, and prospects. The complaint seeks certification as a class action and unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and attorneys' fees. On August 2, 2022, a duplicative purported securities class action complaint (De Schutter v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et.al.) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The claims and parties in De Schutter were substantially similar to those in Schneider. The De Schutter case was transferred on consent to the Southern District court, and the Schneider and De Schutter actions have now been consolidated under the caption In re Teladoc Health, Inc. Securities Litigation. On August 23, 2022, the court appointed Leadersel Innotech ESG as lead plaintiff pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 30, 2022, on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of the Company's common stock during the period February 24, 2021 to July 27, 2022, and filed a second amended complaint on December 6, 2022, on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of the Company's common stock during the period February 11, 2021 to July 27, 2022. On July 5, 2023, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. The Company believes that it has substantial defenses, and the Company and its named officers intend to defend any appeal or further proceedings in the lawsuit vigorously.

On August 9, 2022, a verified shareholder derivative complaint (Vaughn v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et.al.) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company as a nominal defendant and certain of the Company's officers and directors. The complaint asserts violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets in connection with factual assertions similar to those in the purported securities class action complaints described above. The complaint seeks damages to the Company allegedly sustained as a result of the acts and omissions of the named officers and directors and seeks an order directing the Company to reform and improve the Company's corporate governance. On September 6, 2022, a duplicative verified stockholder derivative complaint (Hendry v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et. al.) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The claims and parties in Hendry were substantially similar to those in Vaughn. The Vaughn and Hendry actions have now been consolidated under the caption In re Teladoc Stockholder Derivative Litigation, and a consolidated complaint was filed on November 29, 2022. The consolidated complaint also asserts violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The parties subsequently stipulated to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and on December 22, 2022 the parties agreed, and the Court ordered, to stay all proceedings until final resolution, including exhaustion of appeals, of the motion to dismiss filed in the purported securities class action complaint described above.

On July 30, 2020, the Company's subsidiary BetterHelp, Inc. ("BetterHelp") received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as part of its non-public investigation to determine whether BetterHelp engaged in unfair business practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In March 2023, BetterHelp and the FTC entered into a tentative settlement of all claims arising from the FTC's investigation and agreed to a consent order that required the Company to make a $7.8 million payment to the FTC. The settlement, including the consent order, received final approval from the FTC on July 14, 2023.

There have been multiple putative class-action litigations filed against BetterHelp in connection with the above-referenced FTC settlement and consent order. The actions have been filed in California federal and state courts and in Canada. The cases are substantially similar, involving allegations of misleading patients as to BetterHelp's use of patient data and associated alleged violations of law involving privacy, advertising, contract and tort. The Company believes that it has substantial defenses, and the Company intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously.

## Note 16. Segments

ASC Subtopic 280-10, "Segment Reporting," establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company's Chief Executive Officer is the CODM and is responsible for reviewing financial information presented on a segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.

The CODM measures and evaluates segments based on segment operating revenues together with Adjusted EBITDA. The Company excludes the following items from segment Adjusted EBITDA: provision for income taxes; other income, net; interest income; interest expense; depreciation and amortization; goodwill impairment; stock-based compensation; restructuring costs; and acquisition, integration and transformation charges. Although these amounts are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA, they are included in reported consolidated net loss and are included in the reconciliation that follows.

The Company's computation of segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled metrics computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.

Operating revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining its operating results. Other expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are based upon allocation methodologies, including the following: revenue, headcount, time and other relevant usage measures, and/or a combination of such.

The Company has two reportable segments: Teladoc Health Integrated Care and BetterHelp. The Integrated Care segment includes a suite of global virtual medical services including general medical, expert medical services, specialty medical, chronic condition management, mental health, and enabling technologies and enterprise telehealth solutions for hospitals and health systems. The BetterHelp segment includes virtual therapy and other wellness services provided on a global basis which are predominantly marketed and sold on a direct-to-consumer basis. Other reflects certain revenues and charges not related to ongoing segment operations.

The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a segment basis. Segments do not record intersegment revenues, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

The following table presents revenues by segment (in thousands):

## Overview

Teladoc, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Texas in June 2002 and changed its state of incorporation to the State of Delaware in October 2008. Effective August 10, 2018, Teladoc, Inc. changed its corporate name to Teladoc Health, Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, Teladoc Health, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as "Teladoc Health," the "Company," or "we." The Company's principal executive office is located in Purchase, New York. Teladoc Health is the global leader in whole person virtual care focusing on forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes, and value around the world.

Teladoc Health was founded on a simple, yet revolutionary idea: that everyone should have access to the best healthcare, anywhere in the world on their terms. Today, we have a vision of making virtual care the first step on any healthcare journey, and we are delivering on this mission by providing whole person virtual care that includes primary care, mental health, chronic condition management, and more.

## Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

We believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following:

## As it relates to the Integrated Care segment:

Number of U.S. Integrated Care Members. U.S. Integrated Care members represent the number of unique individuals who have paid access and visit fee only access to our suite of integrated care services in the U.S. at the end of the applicable period. Our revenue growth rate and long-term profitability are affected by our ability to increase cross selling capability among our existing members over time because we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from access and other fees via Client contracts that provide members access to our professional provider network in exchange for a contractual based periodic fee. Therefore, we believe that our ability to add new members and retain existing members, and to increase utilization and penetration further into existing and new health plan Clients is a key indicator of our increasing market adoption, the growth of our business, and our future revenue potential. We further believe that increasing our membership is an integral objective that will provide us with the ability to continually innovate our services

## Table of Contents

and support initiatives that will enhance members' experiences. U.S. Integrated Care members increased by 8.3 million to 90.2 million at September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.

Chronic Care Program Enrollment . Chronic care program enrollment represents the total number of enrollees across our suite of chronic care programs at the end of a given period. Our chronic care program enrollments are one of the key components of our whole person virtual care platform that we believe positions us to drive greater engagement with our platforms and increased revenue. Chronic care program enrollment increased by 13% to 1.122 million at September 30, 2023, compared to 0.993 million at September 30, 2022.

Average Monthly Revenue Per U.S. Integrated Care Member . Average monthly revenue per U.S. Integrated Care member measures the average monthly amount of global revenue that we generate from a U.S. Integrated Care member for a particular period. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated from the Integrated Care segment by the average number of U.S. Integrated Care members during the applicable period. Approximately 20% of total Integrated Care revenues relates to international and hospital and health systems for which membership is not considered as a management metric. We believe that our ability to increase the revenue generated from each member over time is also a key indicator of our increasing market adoption, the growth of our business, and future revenue potential. Average monthly revenue per U.S. Integrated Care member increased to $1.41 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, from $1.40 in the same period in 2022, primarily due to increasing chronic care revenues over the course of the year. Average monthly revenue per U.S. Integrated Care member decreased to $1.40 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from $1.42 in the same period in 2022, primarily due to the impact of new members onboarded over the course of the year. The change in average monthly revenue versus the indicated prior period is reflective of the growth and timing of onboarding new members and the mix of their fees.

## As it relates to the BetterHelp segment:

BetterHelp Paying Users. BetterHelp paying users represent the average number of global monthly paying users of our BetterHelp therapy services during the applicable period. We believe that our ability to add new paying users and retain existing users is a key indicator of the increasing market adoption of BetterHelp, the growth of that business, and future revenue potential. Our ability to reach new potential paying users through various advertising channels helped us to increase BetterHelp paying users by 5% to 0.459 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.437 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and increased by 14% to 0.467 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.409 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

## As it relates to the Company:

Seasonality. Our business has historically been subject to seasonality. In our Integrated Care segment, a concentration of our new Client contracts have an effective date of January 1 as a result of many Clients' introduction of new services at the start of each calendar year. Therefore, while membership increases, utilization and enrollment rates are dampened until service delivery ramps up over the course of the year. As a result of seasonal cold and flu trends, we historically have experienced our highest level of visit and other fee revenue during the first and fourth quarters of each year.

Due to the higher cost of customer acquisition during the end-of-year holiday season, our BetterHelp segment has historically reduced marketing activity during the fourth quarter. As a result of this dynamic, we have typically experienced fewer new member additions and the strongest operating income performance in the fourth quarter. Conversely, as marketing activity typically resumes at the start of the year, we typically experience the weakest operating income performance during the first quarter as new customer acquisition and revenue growth lags marketing spend.

## Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and other items. We base our estimates on

## Table of Contents

historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates see Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the 2022 Form 10-K. In addition, the following updates our discussion of impairment testing therein as of September 30, 2023.

## Goodwill Impairment Charge

There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill or definite-lived intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of the last goodwill testing period, the excess of reporting unit value over carrying value was significant for the remaining unimpaired goodwill, which was the portion of goodwill assigned to the BetterHelp segment on the October 1, 2022 testing date.

At June 30, 2022, we performed an impairment assessment using updated valuation assumptions as compared to those used for the March 31, 2022 impairment assessment. The discount rate was increased for a company risk premium to reflect the then-current perception of risks of achieving projected cash flows and, to a lesser extent, to reflect further increases in interest rates and market volatility. Additionally, revenue market multiples were lowered based upon an updated analysis of a consistent peer group. The June 30, 2022 assessment did not result in an impairment of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets, but did result in an additional $3.0 billion non-deductible goodwill impairment charge (or $18.78 per basic and diluted share). As a result, a $9.6 billion non-deductible goodwill impairment charge (or $59.73 per basic and diluted share) was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The non-cash impairment charges had no impact on the provision for income taxes.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use earnings before interest, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance, and are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance and financial and business trends from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, and that free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed together with GAAP results, provides management, investors, and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance.

EBITDA consists of net loss before interest income; interest expense; other income, net, including foreign exchange gain or loss; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; and goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss before interest income; interest expense; other income, net, including foreign exchange gain or loss; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; goodwill impairment; stock-based compensation; restructuring costs; and acquisition, integration, and transformation costs.

Free cash flow is net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.

Our use of these non-GAAP terms may vary from that of others in our industry, and other companies may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, and they should not be considered as an alternative to net loss before provision for income taxes, net loss, net loss per

## Table of Contents

share, net cash from operating activities or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

- · EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA eliminate the impact of the provision for income taxes on our results of operations, and they do not reflect goodwill impairment, interest income, interest expense or other income, net;
- · Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring costs. Restructuring costs may include certain lease impairment costs, certain losses related to early lease terminations, and severance;
- · Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect significant acquisition, integration, and transformation costs. Acquisition, integration and transformation costs include investment banking, financing, legal, accounting, consultancy, integration, fair value changes related to contingent consideration and certain other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions. It also includes costs related to certain business transformation initiatives focused on integrating and optimizing various operations and systems, including upgrading our customer relationship management ("CRM") and enterprise resource planning ("ERP") systems. These transformation cost adjustments made to our results do not represent normal, recurring, operating expenses necessary to operate the business but rather, incremental costs incurred in connection with our acquisition and integration activities; and
- · Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant non-cash stock compensation expense which should be viewed as a component of recurring operating costs.

In addition, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements.

We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP measures along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include net loss, net loss per share, net cash provided by operating activities, and other performance measures.

In evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we initiated a strategy to transition the majority of our chronic condition management Clients and members to the Teladoc Health brand on a phased basis, with a smaller subset continuing to be served under the Livongo trade name beyond 2024. In connection with the brand strategy, we accelerated the amortization associated with the Livongo trademark, increasing amortization expense in the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2024, with corresponding reductions thereafter.

BetterHelp total revenues increased by $20.7 million, or 8%, to $285.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 5% increase in average monthly paying users. BetterHelp total revenues increased by $114.8 million, or 15%, to $857.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a 14% increase in average monthly paying users.

BetterHelp Adjusted EBITDA increased by $14.8 million, or 133%, to $26.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher technology and development costs, advertising and marketing costs, and general and administrative expenses. BetterHelp Adjusted EBITDA increased by $16.5 million, or 27%, to $77.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing costs and, to a lesser extent, higher general and administrative, and technology and development expenses.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands):

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $1,030.5 million as of September 30, 2023.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and contractual obligation needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, contract renewal activity, number of visits, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, our expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of telehealth, and our debt service obligations. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and to settle debt obligations. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, debt issuance, and bank borrowings.

See Note 10. "Convertible Senior Notes" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our convertible senior notes.

We routinely enter into contractual obligations with third parties to provide professional services, licensing, and other products and services in support of our ongoing business. The current estimated cost of these contracts is not expected to be significant to our liquidity and capital resources based on contracts in place as of September 30, 2023.

## Cash from Operating Activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $219.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $123.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by growth in the business as well as lower incentive compensation payments, higher non-income tax refunds, and higher interest income.

The primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation, provider fees, engagement marketing, direct-to-consumer digital and media advertising, inventory, insurance, technology costs, interest expense and acquisition, integration, and transformation costs. Historically, cash compensation is at its highest level in the first quarter when discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year is paid.

## Cash from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities was $119.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and $113.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Amounts for both periods substantially relate to payments for capitalized software development costs associated with ongoing projects to continuously improve and optimize our products and services.

## Cash from Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $12.6 million and $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 was negatively affected by certain miscellaneous cash outflows that were not present in the current year-to-date period.

The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in thousands, unaudited):

| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 219,939                              | $ 123,743                              |
| Capital expenditures                      | (10,060)                               | (10,285)                               |
| Capitalized software                      | (109,781)                              | (108,588)                              |
| Free Cash Flow                            | $ 100,098                              | $ 4,870                                |

Free cash flow was a positive $100.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The year-over-year increase was substantially driven by growth in operating cash flow as capitalized expenditures and capitalized software were essentially unchanged in the year-over-year period.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

## Interest Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Risk

Cash equivalents that are subject to interest rate volatility represent our principal market risk. We do not expect cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates as our convertible senior notes bear fixed interest rates. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

We operate our business primarily within the U.S. which accounts for approximately 86% of our revenues. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to our foreign exchange exposure as we believe it is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

## Concentrations of Risk and Significant Clients

Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We deposit our cash with financial institutions in the U.S. and in foreign countries, however, our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in institutional money market funds.

No Client represented over 10% of consolidated revenues for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2022.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired

## Table of Contents

control objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During 2022, we implemented a new ERP system for selected entities and transaction types included within our consolidated financial statements. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, we implemented this ERP system for additional entities and functions. As a result of these ERP system implementations, we revised certain existing internal controls, processes, and procedures. There are inherent risks in implementing an ERP system and, accordingly, we will continue to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of these controls.

Other than these ERP system implementations, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
