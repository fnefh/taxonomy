<p>There are significant uncertainties associated with estimating revenue, many of which take several years to resolve. These estimates are subject to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues, as well as patient issues, including determination of applicable primary and secondary coverage, changes in patient insurance coverage and coordination of benefits. As these estimates are refined over time, both positive and negative adjustments to revenue are recognized in the current period.</p>
<p>Dialysis patient service revenues. Revenues are recognized based on the Company's estimate of the transaction price the Company expects to collect as a result of satisfying its performance obligations. Dialysis patient service revenues are recognized in the period services are provided based on these estimates. Revenues consist primarily of payments from government and commercial health plans for dialysis services provided to patients.</p>
<p>Other revenues. Other revenues consist of revenues earned by the Company's non-dialysis ancillary services as well as fees for management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis businesses that the Company does not consolidate. Other revenues are estimated and recognized in the period the performance obligation is met, subject to applicable measurement constraints. The Company's integrated kidney care (IKC) revenues include revenues earned under risk-based arrangements, including value-based care (VBC) arrangements. Under its VBC arrangements, the Company assumes full or shared financial risk for the total medical cost of care for patients below or above a benchmark. The benchmarks against which the Company incurs profit or loss on these contracts are typically based on the underlying premiums paid to the insuring entity (the Company's counterparty), with adjustments where applicable, or on trended or adjusted medical cost targets.</p>
<p>For its IKC business, the Company recognized revenues for performance obligations satisfied in previous years of $31,309 and $23,303 during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The delay in recognition of these amounts resulted predominantly from measurement limitations and recognition constraints on the Company's VBC contracts with health plans, many of which are complex and relatively new arrangements. The Company's revenue recognition for its government Comprehensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) program also remains constrained for plan year 2023.</p>
<p>Measurements of revenue for the Company's IKC risk-based arrangements are complex, sensitive to a number of key inputs, and require meaningful estimates for a number of factors, including but not limited to member alignment data, third-party medical claims expense, outcomes on various quality metrics, and ultimate risk adjustment factor (RAF) scores. Information and other measurement limitations on these factors may constrain revenue recognition for a risk-based arrangement until a period after the Company's performance obligations have been met.</p>

<hr />
<p>Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Weighted average common shares outstanding include restricted stock unit awards that are no longer subject to forfeiture because the recipients have satisfied either the explicit vesting terms or retirement eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of outstanding stock-settled stock appreciation rights and unvested stock units as computed under the treasury stock method.</p>

<p>Scheduled maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2024 were as follows:</p>
<p>| 2024 (remainder of the year) | $ 465,033 |
| --- | --- |
| 2025 | $ 147,057 |
| 2026 | $ 1,040,219 |

| 2028 | $ 1,295,333 |
| 2029 | $ 41,171 |
| Thereafter | $ 5,924,763 |</p>
<p>On May 9, 2024 (Fourth Amendment Effective Date), the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment) to its senior secured credit agreement dated as of August 12, 2019 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including by the Fourth Amendment, the Credit Agreement). The Fourth Amendment modifies the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date for a portion of its Term Loan B-1 in the aggregate principal amount of $911,598 and extend an additional incremental principal amount of $728,653 (together, referred to as the Extended Term Loan B-1). The Company used the incremental proceeds from the Extended Term Loan B-1 to prepay a proportionate amount of the principal balance still outstanding on its Term Loan B-1.</p>
<p>The Extended Term Loan B-1 bears interest at the Company's option, based on (i) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus the Applicable Margin (as defined below), or (ii) the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate that is published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (Term SOFR) plus the Applicable Margin. The "Base Rate" is defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rateof Wells Fargo as established from time to time and (iii) Term SOFR for an interest period of one month plus1.00%; provided that if Term SOFR or the Base Rate is less than 0.00% such rate shall be deemed to be0.00% for purposes of the Credit Agreement. The "Applicable Margin" for the Extended Term Loan B-1 is 2.00% in the case of Term SOFR loans, and1.00% in the case of Base Rate loans. The Extended Term Loan B-1 requires quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2024 of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Extended Term Loan B-1 outstanding on the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, with the balance due on May 9, 2031.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the Company's senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed and secured by substantially all of DaVita Inc.'s and certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries' assets and rank senior to all unsecured indebtedness. Borrowings under the Term Loan A-1, Term Loan B-1, Extended Term Loan B-1 and revolving line of credit rank equal in priority for that security and related subsidiary guarantees. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants such as various restrictions or limitations on permitted amounts of investments (including acquisitions), share repurchases, payment of dividends, and redemptions and incurrence of other indebtedness. Many of these restrictions and limitations will not apply as long as the Company's leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement is below 4.00:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires compliance with a maximum leverage ratio covenant, tested quarterly, of 5.00:1.00 through June 30, 2026 and4.50:1.00 thereafter (subject to an increase to5.00:1.00 during the four fiscal quarters following a material acquisition).</p>
<p>In addition to the prepayment of Term Loan B-1, as described above, during the first six months of 2024, the Company made regularly scheduled principal payments under its senior secured credit facilities totaling $15,625 on Term Loan A-1 and $13,716 on Term Loan B-1.</p>
<p>As a result of the transaction described above, the Company recognized debt prepayment, extinguishment and modification costs of $9,732 in the second quarter of 2024 comprised partially of fees incurred for this transaction and partially of deferred financing costs and original issue discount written off for the portion of debt considered extinguished and reborrowed as a result of the Fourth Amendment. For the portion of the debt that was considered extinguished and reborrowed, the Company recognized constructive financing cash outflows and financing cash inflows on the statement of cash flows of $6,302 and $728,653 for the Extended Term Loan B-1, respectively, and constructive financing cash outflows of $722,351 for the prepayment of a portion of Term Loan B-1, even though no funds were actually paid or received. Another $13,282 of the debt considered extinguished related to the Extended Term Loan B-1 represented a non-cash financing activity.</p>
<p>On March 1, 2024, Change Healthcare (CHC), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group launched a temporary assistance</p>

<p>funding program (CHC Funding) to help bridge the gap in short-term cash flow needs for providers impacted by the disruption of CHC's services. Under the program, CHC provides funding to providers for amounts that would otherwise have been received (with certain limitations), but for the disruption in processing electronic claims as a result of the outage. Amounts provided under this program are subject to repayment within 45 business days from a future date to be mutually agreed to by CHC and the Company.</p>
<p>CHC has restored the majority of claims submission functionality and the Company has resumed submission of most of its commercial claims through CHC's platform, although the Company continues to experience payment collection delays. As of June 30, 2024, the remaining CHC Funding amount outstanding was $392,984.</p>
<p>The Company's 2019 interest rate cap agreements expired on June 30, 2024 and a portion of the Company's 2023 cap agreements became effective on or prior to June 30, 2024, as detailed in the table below. As of June 30, 2024, the effective portion of the Company's 2023 interest rate cap agreements have the economic effect of capping the Company's maximum exposure to SOFR variable interest rate changes on equivalent amounts of the Company's floating rate debt, including all of Term Loan B-1, Extended Term Loan B-1, and a portion of Term Loan A-1. The remaining $308,820 outstanding principal balance of Term Loan A-1 and $260,000 balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit are subject to SOFR-based interest rate volatility. These cap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and, as a result, changes in their fair values are reported in other comprehensive income. The original premiums paid for the caps are amortized to debt expense on a straight-line basis over the term of each cap agreement starting from its effective date. These cap agreements do not contain credit risk-contingent features.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2024 the Company entered into several forward interest rate cap agreements, described below, that have the economic effect of capping the Company's exposure to SOFR variable interest rate changes on specific portions of the Company's floating rate debt (2024 cap agreements). These 2024 cap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and, as a result, changes in their fair values will be reported in other comprehensive income. These 2024 cap agreements do not contain credit-risk contingent features and become effective and expire as described in the table below.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate cap agreements outstanding as of June 30, 2024:</p>

<li>Commitments and contingencies</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The Company operates in a highly regulated industry and is a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations (which frequently arise from qui tam suits) and audits (including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from its obligation to self-report suspected violations of law) and other legal proceedings, including, without limitation, those described below. The Company records accruals for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's total recorded accruals with respect to legal proceedings and regulatory matters, net of anticipated third party recoveries, were immaterial. While these accruals reflect the Company's best estimate of the probable loss for those matters as of the dates of those accruals, the recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of the losses for those matters, and any anticipated third party recoveries for any such losses may not ultimately be recoverable. Additionally, in some cases, no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, which also may be impacted by various factors, including, without limitation, that they may involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or non-monetary remedies; present novel legal theories or legal uncertainties; involve disputed facts; represent a shift in regulatory policy; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or may result in a change of business practices. Further, there may be various levels of judicial review available to the Company in connection with any such proceeding.</p>
<p>The following is a description of certain lawsuits, claims, governmental investigations and audits and other legal proceedings to which the Company is subject.</p>
<h2>Certain Governmental Inquiries and Related Proceedings</h2>
<p>2017 U.S. Attorney Colorado Investigation: In November 2017, the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of Colorado informed the Company of an investigation it was conducting into possible federal healthcare offenses involving DaVita Kidney Care, as well as several of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition to DaVita Kidney Care, the matter included an investigation into DaVita Rx, DaVita Laboratory Services, Inc. (DaVita Labs), and RMS Lifeline Inc. (Lifeline). In each of August 2018, May 2019, and July 2021, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) pursuant to the FCA from the U.S. Attorney's Office relating to this investigation. In May 2020, the Company sold its interest in Lifeline, but the Company retained certain liabilities of the Lifeline business, including those related to this investigation. On May 6, 2024, the Company finalized and executed a settlement agreement with the government and the relator in a qui tam matter that included a settlement amount of $34,487 for this matter. On May 7, 2024, the government notified the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado of its decision to intervene for purposes of settlement in the matter of U.S. ex rel. Kogod v. DaVita Inc., et al . The</p>

<p>(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)</p>
<p>government and the relator agreed to voluntarily dismiss all substantive claims in the matter, and, on July 18, 2024, the District Court dismissed all claims except for the relator's statutory claim for expenses, attorney's fees, and costs. The Company disputes the relator's request for expenses, attorney's fees, and costs, and intends to defend accordingly.</p>
<p>2020 U.S. Attorney New Jersey Investigation: In March 2020, the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of New Jersey served the Company with a subpoena and a CID relating to an investigation being conducted by that office and the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The subpoena and CID request information on several topics, including certain of the Company's joint venture arrangements with physicians and physician groups, medical director agreements, and compliance with its five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, the term of which expired October 22, 2019. In November 2022, the Company learned that, on April 1, 2022, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey notified the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey of its decision not to elect to intervene in the matter of U.S. ex rel. Doe v. DaVita Inc. and filed a Stipulation of Dismissal. On April 13, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the case without prejudice. On October 12, 2022, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania notified the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, of its decision not to elect to intervene at this time in the matter of U.S. ex rel. Bayne v. DaVita Inc., et al. The court then unsealed an amended complaint, which alleges violations of federal and state False Claims Acts, by order dated October 14, 2022. On November 8, 2023, the private party relator filed a fourth amended complaint. On November 29, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint.</p>
<p>2020 California Department of Insurance Investigation: In April 2020, the California Department of Insurance (CDI) sent the Company an Investigative Subpoena relating to an investigation being conducted by that office. CDI issued a superseding subpoena in September 2020 and an additional subpoena in September 2021. Those subpoenas request information on a number of topics, including but not limited to the Company's communications with patients about insurance plans and financial assistance from the American Kidney Fund (AKF), analyses of the potential impact of patients' decisions to change insurance providers, and documents relating to donations or contributions to the AKF. The Company is continuing to cooperate with CDI in this investigation.</p>
<p>2023 District of Columbia Office of Attorney General Investigation: In January 2023, the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia issued a CID to the Company in connection with an antitrust investigation into the AKF. The CID covers the period from January 1, 2016 to the present. The CID requests information on a number of topics, including but not limited to the Company's communications with AKF, documents relating to donations to the AKF, and communications with patients, providers, and insurers regarding the AKF. The Company is cooperating with the government in this investigation.</p>
<p>2024 Federal Trade Commission Investigation: In April 2024, the Company received from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) two CIDs in connection with an industry investigation under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding the acquisition of Medical Director services and provision of dialysis services. The CIDs cover the period from January 1, 2016 to the present and generally seek information relating to restrictive covenants, such as non-competes, with physicians. The Company is cooperating with the government in this investigation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although the Company cannot predict whether or when proceedings might be initiated or when these matters may be resolved (other than as may be described above), it is not unusual for inquiries such as these to continue for a considerable period of time through the various phases of document and witness requests and ongoing discussions with regulators and to develop over the course of time. In addition to the inquiries and proceedings specifically identified above, the Company frequently is subject to other inquiries by state or federal government agencies, many of which relate to qui tam complaints filed by relators. Negative findings or terms and conditions that the Company might agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future government inquiries or relator proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against the Company, substantial payments made by the Company, harm to the Company's reputation, required changes to the Company's business practices, an impact on the Company's various relationships and/or contracts related to the Company's business, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs and, if criminal proceedings were initiated against the Company, members of its board of directors or management, possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.</p>

<h2>Other Proceedings</h2>
<p>2021 Antitrust Indictment and Putative Class Action Suit: On July 14, 2021, an indictment was returned by a grand jury in the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado against the Company and its former chief executive officer in the matter of U.S. v. DaVita Inc., et al. alleging that purported agreements entered into by DaVita's former chief executive officer not to solicit senior-level employees violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. On April 15, 2022, a jury returned a verdict in the Company's favor, acquitting both the Company and its former chief executive officer on all counts. On April 20, 2022, the court entered judgments of acquittal and closed the case. On August 9, 2021, DaVita Inc. and its former chief executive officer were added as defendants in a consolidated putative class action complaint in the matter of In re Outpatient Medical Center Employee Antitrust Litigation in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois. This class action complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act and seeks to bring an action on behalf of certain groups of individuals employed by the Company between February 1, 2012 and January 5, 2021. On September 26, 2022, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company disputes the allegations in the class action complaint, as well as the asserted violations of the Sherman Act, and intends to defend this action accordingly.</p>
<p>Additionally, from time to time the Company is subject to other lawsuits, demands, claims, governmental investigations and audits and legal proceedings that arise due to the nature of its business, including, without limitation, contractual disputes, such as with payors, suppliers and others, employee-related matters and professional and general liability claims. From time to time, the Company also initiates litigation or other legal proceedings as a plaintiff arising out of contracts or other matters.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other than as may be described above, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which the Company is or may be subject from time to time, including those described in this Note 8, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flows. Further, any legal proceedings or regulatory matters involving the Company, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming, and often require management's attention and result in significant legal expense, and may result in the diversion of significant operational resources, may impact the Company's various relationships and/or contracts related to the Company's business or otherwise harm the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or reputation.</p>

<h2>Other Commitments</h2>
<p>The Company also has certain potential commitments to provide working capital funding, if necessary, to certain nonconsolidated dialysis businesses that the Company manages and in which the Company owns a noncontrolling equity interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties of approximately $7,992.</p>

<p>Subsequent to June 30, 2024 through August 2, 2024, the Company repurchased $1,134 shares of its common stock for $158,962 at an average price paid of $138.81 per share. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the Company is authorized to make share repurchases pursuant to a December 17, 2021 Board authorized repurchase plan of $ 2,000,000. This authorization allows the Company to make purchases from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including without limitation, through accelerated share repurchase transactions, derivative transactions, tender offers, Rule 10b5-1 plans or any combination of the foregoing, depending upon market conditions and other considerations.</p>
<p>As of August 2, 2024, the Company has a total of $543,360, excluding excise taxes, available under the current authorization for additional share repurchases. Although this share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, the Company remains subject to share repurchase limitations, including under the terms of its senior secured credit facilities.</p>
<h2>Berkshire share repurchase agreement</h2>
<p>On April 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement (the share repurchase agreement) with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on behalf of itself and its affiliates (collectively, Berkshire). Under the share repurchase agreement, at any time Berkshire beneficially owns at least 45.0% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in the aggregate, the Company shall repurchase from Berkshire, and Berkshire shall sell to the Company, on a quarterly basis, a number of shares of common stock sufficient to return Berkshire's aggregate beneficial ownership to 45.0% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. The per share price the Company will pay Berkshire for any such share repurchase will be the volume-weighted average price per share paid by the Company for any shares of common stock repurchased by the Company from public stockholders pursuant to the Company's share repurchase plan during the applicable repurchase period.</p>
<p>Under this agreement, repurchases of common stock by the Company from Berkshire will occur on the date that istwo business days prior to the date of the Company's regular quarterly or annual investor call to publicly report earnings; however, if at any time the Company determines thatBerkshire beneficially owns or will beneficially own shares of common stock representing more than 49.5% of the issued and outstanding common stock in the aggregate, such determination will trigger immediate share repurchases under this agreement.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024 and August 2, 2024, Berkshire beneficially owned less than 45.0% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and, as a result, no repurchase obligation exists at either date.</p>

<p>Investments in equity securities represent investments in various open-ended registered investment companies (mutual funds) and common stocks and are recorded at fair value estimated based on reported market prices or redemption prices, as applicable. See Note 4 for further discussion.</p>
<p>Interest rate cap agreements are recorded at fair value estimated from valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. The Company does not believe the ultimate amount that could be realized upon settlement of these interest rate cap agreements would be materially different from the fair value estimates currently reported. See Note 7 for further discussion.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the Company had contingent earn-out obligations associated with business acquisitions that could result in the Company paying the former owners a total of up to approximately $53,279 if certain performance targets or quality margins are met over the next one year tofour years. The estimated fair value measurements of these contingent earn-out obligations are primarily based on unobservable inputs, including key financial metrics such as projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), revenue and other key performance indicators. The estimated fair values of these contingent earn-out obligations are remeasured as of each reporting date and could fluctuate based upon any significant changes in key assumptions, such as changes in the Company's credit risk adjusted rate that is used to discount obligations to present value.</p>
<p>The estimated fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is based principally on the higher of either estimated liquidation value of net assets or a multiple of earnings for each subject dialysis partnership, based on historical earnings, revenue mix, and other performance indicators that can affect future results. The multiples used for these valuations are derived from observed ownership transactions for dialysis businesses between unrelated parties in the U.S. in recent years, and the specific valuation multiple applied to each dialysis partnership is principally determined by its recent and expected revenue mix and contribution margin. As of June 30, 2024, an increase or decrease in the weighted average multiple used in these valuations of one times EBITDA would change the estimated fair value of these noncontrolling interests by approximately $205,000. See Notes 16 and 23 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 10-K for further discussion of the Company's methodology for estimating the fair value of noncontrolling interests subject to put obligations. For a reconciliation of changes in noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, see the consolidated statement of equity.</p>
<p>The Company's fair value estimates for its senior secured credit facilities and senior notes are based upon quoted bid and ask prices for these instruments, typically a level 2 input. See Note 7 for further discussion of the Company's debt.</p>
<p>The book value of the Company's contingent consideration payable to Medtronic, Inc. for its interest in Mozarc Medical Holdings LLC approximates its estimated fair value, which is based on level 3 inputs.</p>
<p>Other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, lease liabilities and debt. The balances of financial instruments other than debt and lease liabilities are presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2024 at their approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of their settlements.</p>

<p>New standards not yet adopted</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) , which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance also requires disclosure of the chief operating decision maker's (CODM) position for each segment and detail of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment's performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company has completed its initial assessment of the impact of this new guidance and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which expands income tax disclosure requirements to include additional information related to the rate reconciliation of effective tax rates to statutory rates, as well as additional disaggregation of taxes paid in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The amendments in the ASU also remove disclosures related to certain unrecognized tax benefits and deferred taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the effect this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.</p>

</ul>
<p>The following should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Company Overview</h2>
<p>Our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the United States, which we refer to as our U.S. dialysis business. We also operate our U.S. integrated kidney care (IKC) business, our U.S. other ancillary services, and our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support functions. Our U.S. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the U.S. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (ESRD) or end stage kidney disease (ESKD).</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h2>Change Healthcare</h2>
<p>As previously reported, due to a cybersecurity breach that affected Change Healthcare (CHC), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (United) that served as an intermediary for processing the vast majority of our payment claims for domestic commercial and government payors, we suspended all claims processing activity with CHC (CHC Outage). As a result of the CHC Outage, we were unable to submit payment claims through CHC's platform as of February 2024, and therefore, we experienced a significant reduction in cash flow during the period of time in the first and second quarters beginning after the notice of breach was received on February 21, 2024. As a result of the suspension of claims processing activity with CHC, we set up alternative methods to submit Medicare claims for processing and worked to establish additional alternative methods for claim processing. In addition, we worked to mitigate the impact of the outage through other means, including, for example, by securing certain interest-free funding from United and its affiliates (CHC Funding Arrangement).</p>
<p>Based on information provided by CHC and officials investigating the CHC Outage, we have no indication that our systems were infiltrated by the same threat actor that caused the CHC Outage. CHC began to restore claims submission functionality on March 28, 2024, and CHC subsequently presented us with security protocols that had been put in place following the cybersecurity breach. Following an evaluation of these protocols, and in reliance thereon, we resumed claims submissions and billing processes through CHC's information technology systems. As of the date of this filing, through a combination of CHC's platform and the aforementioned alternate billing processes, we are current on our primary claims submissions. However, the CHC Outage, and the resultant delay in claims submissions, led to an increase in our days sales outstanding (DSOs), among other things. While we have been able to submit claims through CHC after March 28, 2024, we continue to experience payment collection delays, and it is too early to know whether we will receive the full expected value for the claims submitted through CHC that were delayed in their original submission as a result of the outage. The bulk of the initial DSO increase related to the CHC Outage has subsided, and we believe DSOs will continue to decline over the next few months as we continue claims submissions and cash collections in the ordinary course.</p>
<p>CHC recently reported that it identified protected health information (PHI), or personally identifiable information (PII), from users of the CHC systems that was potentially impacted by the CHC Outage. To date, we have not been informed that any of our data, including any PHI or PII from our patients, was impacted by the CHC Outage. We understand that the CHC investigation and data forensics is still ongoing and that there is a potential that our data and PHI or PII from our patients may have been impacted by the CHC Outage.</p>
<p>Since receiving the initial notice from CHC regarding the CHC Outage, we have been reviewing and monitoring our information technology infrastructure and network environment, including specifically for the indicators of compromise identified by CHC and its agents. While there can be no assurances, we do not believe our information technology systems have been affected based on the information available to date. We have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate resources to help resolve the impact of this temporary outage, including, among other things, administrative processes related to collections for services rendered and resolution of disputes such as retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, and the CHC Outage may continue to increase the risks associated with billing and collections. While the CHC Outage has not impacted our ability to provide care to our patients in the ordinary course and we do not currently expect the outage to have a material impact on our operations, financial condition or results of operation, the ultimate impact of the CHC Outage remains subject to future developments and risks that are difficult to predict. These risks may include, among other things, a recurrence of system outages or service suspensions or the risk that our information technology systems or our proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including PHI or PII, may have been compromised through the CHC Outage, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or reputation. For a further discussion of the risks associated with outages, disruptions or incidents at third parties on which we rely, see the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K under the headings, " Failing to effectively maintain, operate or upgrade our information systems or those of third-party service providers upon which we rely... " and " Privacy and information security laws are complex… "</p>
<h2>General Economic and Marketplace Conditions; Legal and Regulatory Developments</h2>
<p>Developments in general economic and market conditions have directly and indirectly impacted the Company and in the future could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, share price, cash flows and/or liquidity. Many of these external factors and conditions are interrelated, including, among other things, inflation, potential interest rate volatility and other economic conditions, labor market conditions, wage pressure, the impact of COVID-19 on the mortality rates of our patients and other ESKD or CKD patients, supply chain challenges and the potential impact and application of innovative technologies, drugs or other treatments. Certain of these impacts could be further intensified by concurrent global events such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding areas, which have continued to drive sociopolitical and economic uncertainty across the globe.</p>
<h2>Operational and Financial Impacts</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2024, treatment per day volumes were higher compared to the first quarter of 2024. While census gains in the quarter helped to drive this increase, we continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and treatment volume due to, among other things, elevated mortality rates of our patients in comparison to the periods prior to the pandemic and the associated adverse impact on our patient census. Treatment volumes during the year have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by higher than expected missed treatment rates, which to date have been driven primarily by severe weather events. In addition, newto-dialysis admission rates, treatment volumes, future revenues and non-acquired growth, among other things, could continue to be negatively impacted over time to the extent that the ESKD and CKD populations experience sustained elevated mortality levels. The magnitude of these cumulative impacts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.</p>
<p>Ongoing global economic conditions and political and regulatory developments, such as general labor, supply chain and inflationary pressures have increased, and will likely continue to increase, our expenses, including, among others, staffing, labor, and supply costs. We have significant suppliers and service providers, with a substantial portion of our total vendor spend concentrated with a limited number of third party suppliers and service providers. These third party suppliers and service providers include, without limitation, providers performing certain key functions for us such as claims processing functions, suppliers of pharmaceuticals or clinical products that may be the primary source of products critical to the services we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. It may be difficult, costly and time consuming for us to transition away from any of these significant suppliers and service providers. We have experienced service disruptions relating to key business functions and supply chain shortages with respect to certain of our equipment and clinical supplies, including critical supplies, and there can be no assurance that our third party suppliers and service providers will provide, or continue to provide, the services or products that we require. If our significant suppliers and service providers do not meet our needs, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources for these products or services on a timely basis, it could require us to make significant operational changes, could impact our ability to provide dialysis services we offer, and could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to evaluate the risk of future supply chain shortages, including by assessing alternative sources for supplies critical to the services we provide. For further discussion of the risks related to our supplier needs, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the heading, " If certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs... "</p>
<p>We continue to experience elevated levels of compensation compared to the prior year. We expect certain of these increased staffing and labor costs to continue, due to, among other factors, the continuation of a challenging healthcare labor market. The cumulative impact of these increased costs could be material. In addition, potential staffing shortages or other potential developments or disruptions related to our teammates, if material, could ultimately lead to the unplanned closures of certain centers or adversely impact clinical operations, or may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things. Our industry has also experienced increased union organizing activities, including the filing of petitions by a union at certain of our clinics in California and at certain of our competitors' clinics, with certain of our competitors' clinics ultimately voting to unionize. We are engaging with our teammates at clinics where union petitions have been filed to respond to these petitions and future elections. Regardless of the outcome of these discussions, other teammates at other clinics may file similar petitions in the future, and these petitions, if filed, may lead to additional elections. If a significant portion of our teammates were to become unionized, we could experience, among other things, potential work stoppages or other business disruptions; adverse impacts to our financial results due to the costs of bargaining or implementing a grievance procedure and processing grievances; decreases in our operational flexibility and efficiency; or negative impacts on our employee culture. In addition, we are and may continue to be subject to targeted corporate campaigns by union organizers in response to which we have been and expect to continue to be required to expend substantial resources, both time and financial. Any of these events or circumstances, including our responses to such events or circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity,</p>
<p>business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. For further discussion of the risks related to rising labor costs and union organizing activities, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the heading, " Our business is labor intensive... "</p>
<p>The impact of the pandemic on our patient population combined with the cost inflation trends and the inability of government reimbursement rates to keep pace with these cost trends, have put pressure on our existing cost structure, and we expect that certain of those increased costs will persist as inflationary and supply chain pressures and challenging labor market conditions continue, each as noted above. During the second quarter of 2024, we continued to invest in and implement cost savings initiatives designed to help mitigate these cost and volume pressures. These include identified cost savings related to the achievement of general and administrative cost efficiencies through ongoing initiatives, including, among others, those that increase our use of third party service providers to perform certain activities. These opportunities and investments also include, among others, initiatives relating to clinic optimization, capacity utilization improvement and procurement opportunities, as well as investments in revenue cycle management. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, charges in connection with the continued implementation of certain of these initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these initiatives or that they will achieve expectations or succeed in helping offset the impact of these challenging conditions.</p>
<h2>Legal and Regulatory Developments</h2>
<p>As previously reported, on April 23, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a final rule that would generally ban all post-employment noncompete clauses with employees and prohibit employers from enforcing existing non-compete clauses in contracts with workers, with limited exceptions. The rule has been enjoined in at least one legal challenge, with a final decision expected in that case by August 30, 2024. The legal challenge may impact FTC's targeted effective date of September 4, 2024. We are continuing to assess the potential impact of the rule on our business, but if the final rule is implemented as currently contemplated, it could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our agreements with teammates, our arrangements with medical directors, or the terms of our existing agreements with physicians. There are also other legislative efforts, including in Congress and more than half of the states' legislatures, that seek to place restrictions on non-compete agreements between employers and workers. While few of these states have passed such legislation that impacted our business, it is possible that similar legislation could be introduced in 2024. Any failure on our part to adequately adjust to this rule, any state follow-on regulations and the potential impact thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.</p>
<p>We believe that the aforementioned recent developments and general economic and marketplace conditions will continue to impact the Company in the future. Their ultimate impact depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Certain columns, rows or percentages may not sum due to the presentation of rounded numbers.</p>
<p>U.S. dialysis average patient service revenue per treatment for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 increased primarily due to normal seasonal improvements driven by patients meeting their co-insurance and deductibles and increases in average reimbursement rates due to normal annual rate increases, partially offset by unfavorable changes in mix.</p>
<p>U.S. dialysis average patient service revenue per treatment for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by the increase in average reimbursement rates from normal annual rate increases including Medicare rate increases, as well as revenue cycle improvements, favorable changes in mix and an increase in hospital inpatient dialysis rates.</p>
<p>In June 2024, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule to update the Medicare ESRD Prospective Payment System payment rate and policies for calendar year 2025. Among other things, the proposed rule, if finalized, would allow Medicare payment for dialysis in the home setting for beneficiaries with acute kidney injury and update requirements for the ESRD Quality Incentive Program. CMS estimates that the overall impact of the proposed rule will increase ESRD freestanding facilities' average reimbursement by 2.1% in 2025.</p>

<h2>Charges impacting operating income</h2>
<p>Closure costs. During the third quarter of 2023, we continued the strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been significantly impacted by declines in our patient census due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This continuing review, begun in the third quarter of 2022, has resulted in higher than normal charges for center capacity closures over the last several quarters. These capacity closure costs include net losses on assets retired, lease termination costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2024, we incurred charges for U.S. dialysis center closures of approximately $15.3 million, which increased our patient care costs by $6.5 million, our general and administrative expenses by $8.7 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $0.1 million. By comparison, during the first quarter of 2024, U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately $14.6 million, which increased our patient care costs by $3.3 million, our general and administrative expenses by $7.1 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $4.2 million.</p>
<p>During the six months ended June 30, 2024, U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately $29.9 million, which increased our patient care costs by $9.8 million, our general and administrative expenses by $15.8 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $4.3 million. By comparison, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, U.S. dialysis center</p>
<p>closures were approximately $43.3 million, which increased our patient care costs by $18.3 million, our general and administrative expenses by $12.6 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $12.4 million.</p>
<p>We will continue to optimize our U.S. dialysis center footprint through center mergers and/or closures and expect our center closure rates to remain at elevated levels over the remainder of 2024.</p>
<p>Severance costs. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our U.S. dialysis business. This plan included additional charges of $21.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Patient care costs. U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment for the second quarter of 2024 increased from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, health benefit expense, medical supplies expense, insurance costs and center closure costs. These increases were partially offset by decreased compensation expenses including seasonal decreases in payroll taxes and decreased travel costs. Additionally, our fixed other direct operating expenses positively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to increased treatments in the second quarter of 2024, as well as decreased professional fees and decreased pharmaceutical unit costs.</p>
<p>U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to increased compensation expenses, including increased wage rates and headcount, as well as increases in insurance costs, medical supplies expense and health benefits expense. These increases were partially offset by decreased contract wages, contributions to charitable organizations, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers and center closure costs. Patient care costs per treatment were also favorably impacted by decreased IT-related costs, pharmaceutical unit costs, tax and license costs and professional fees. In addition, our fixed other direct operating expenses favorably impacted patient care costs per treatment due to increased treatments in 2024.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses. U.S. dialysis general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2024 increased from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased compensation expenses, professional fees, center closure costs and long-term incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advocacy costs.</p>
<p>U.S. dialysis general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to increased advocacy costs, primarily related to a refund received in 2023 related to 2022 advocacy costs, as well as increases in IT-related costs and compensation expenses including increased wage rates. Other drivers of this change include increased professional fees and center closure costs. These increases were partially offset by decreased severance costs, as described above.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization. U.S. dialysis depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to decreases in depreciation related to corporate IT projects and accelerated depreciation related to center closures.</p>
<p>U.S. dialysis depreciation and amortization expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to decreased accelerated depreciation related to center closures.</p>
<p>Equity investment income. U.S. dialysis equity investment income remained relatively flat for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024. Equity investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased due to the consolidation of a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Gain on changes in ownership interests. During the first quarter of 2024, we acquired a controlling interest in a previously nonconsolidated dialysis partnership for which we recognized a non-cash gain of $35.1 million on our prior investment upon consolidation.</p>

Operating income and adjusted operating income were negatively impacted by increases in compensation expenses, insurance costs, medical supplies expense, advocacy costs including the refund described above, and health benefit expense.</p>
<h2>Other-Ancillary services</h2>
<p>Our other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. As of June 30, 2024, these consisted principally of our U.S. IKC business, certain U.S. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, DaVita IKC provided integrated care and disease management services to approximately 71,300 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and to an additional 15,200 patients in other integrated care arrangements. We also expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to kidney disease.</p>
<p>For a discussion of the risks related to IKC and our ancillary services, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K under the headings, " The U.S. integrated kidney care, U.S. other ancillary services and international operations that we operate or invest in now or in the future..." and "If we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives..."</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, our international dialysis operations provided dialysis and administrative services through a total of 452 outpatient dialysis centers located in 13 countries outside of the United States.</p>

<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>IKC revenues for the second quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to a decrease in revenues from our special needs plans, partially offset by a net increase in shared savings. U.S. other ancillary revenues for the second quarter of 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2024. International revenues for the second quarter of 2024 increased compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to acquired treatment growth.</p>
<p>IKC revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to a net increase in shared savings. U.S. other ancillary services revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Our international revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to acquired and non-acquired treatment growth and average reimbursement rate increases in certain countries.</p>
<h2>Charges impacting operating income</h2>
<p>Severance and other costs . During the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to U.S. dialysis, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions and other overhead costs. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our IKC business of $0.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Operating (loss) income and adjusted operating (loss) income</h2>
<p>IKC operating loss for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by decreased revenues and increased medical expenses related to our special needs plans, partially offset by a net increase in shared savings. U.S. other ancillary services operating loss for the second quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2024. International operating income for the second quarter of 2024 increased from the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to increased revenues, as described above, partially offset by acquisition-related costs.</p>
<p>IKC operating loss and adjusted operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased, primarily due to increases in revenue, as described above, partially offset by continued investments in our integrated care support functions and increased expenses at IKC. Other U.S. ancillary services operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. International operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by increased acquisition-related costs, partially offset by increases in revenue, as described above.</p>

<p>Corporate administrative support expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased primarily due to decreased professional fees and a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes. Corporate administrative support expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to decreased long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by increased compensation expenses.</p>

<h2>Debt expense</h2>
<p>Debt expense for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to a decrease in our weighted average effective interest rate, driven by the Change HealthCare interest-free temporary funding assistance.</p>
<p>Our overall weighted average effective interest rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 4.27% compared to 4.51% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the components of our debt.</p>
<h2>Debt prepayment, extinguishment and modification costs</h2>
<p>The three and six months ended June 30, 2024 included debt prepayment, extinguishment and modifications costs of $10 million comprised partially of fees incurred in connection with the extension of the maturity date of a portion of our Term Loan B-1 from August 2026 to May 2031 (the Term Loan B-1 Extension) and partially of deferred financing costs and original issue discount written off for the portion of debt considered extinguished and reborrowed as a result of the Term Loan B-1 Extension. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the Term Loan B-1 Extension and the components of our debt.</p>
<h2>Other (loss) income, net</h2>
<p>Other loss for the second quarter of 2024 increased compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in equity investment losses at Mozarc Medical Holding LLC (Mozarc). Other loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to other income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increased equity investment losses in Mozarc, including the $14.0 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023 on the non-cash assets contributed to Mozarc, partially offset by a decrease in net losses on other investments.</p>
<h2>Effective income tax rate</h2>
<p>The effective income tax rate and the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. increased for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2024 from stock-based compensation.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a reduction in benefits recognized for the portion of our earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, partially offset by an increase in benefits recognized in 2024 for forecasted tax credits and a nontaxable noncash gain on change in ownership.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in benefits recognized in 2024 for forecasted tax credits and a nontaxable noncash gain on change in ownership.</p>
<p>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests</p>
<p>The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of 2024 from the first quarter of 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to increased profitability at certain U.S. dialysis partnerships.</p>
<h2>U.S. dialysis accounts receivable</h2>
<p>Our U.S. dialysis accounts receivable balances at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.812 billion and $1.632 billion, respectively, representing approximately 59 and 54 days of revenue outstanding (DSO), respectively. The increase in DSO is primarily due to payment collection delays related to the CHC Outage, described above. Our DSO calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day. There were no significant changes from the first quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2024 in the carrying amount of accounts receivable outstanding over one year old.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and capital resources</h2>

<h2>Consolidated cash flows</h2>
<p>Consolidated cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to decreased cash collections resulting from the CHC Outage, described above, combined with increased cash taxes paid and decreases in other working capital items, partially offset by improved operating results.</p>
<p>CHC began to restore claims submission functionality on March 28, 2024 and we have resumed submission of most of our commercial claims through CHC's platform, although we continue to experience payment collection delays. As of June 30, 2024, the CHC Outage, described above, continue to affect our ability to submit some claims, resulting in an increase in our</p>
<p>patient accounts receivable balances and DSO, which ultimately negatively impacted our net cash provided by operating activities and resulted in an increase in outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter of 2024, accounts receivable balances and DSO have declined and are expected to continue to decline.</p>
<p>Free cash flow during the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as described above, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Significant sources of cash during the period included the extension of the maturity date from August 2026 to May 2031 for a portion of our Term Loan B-1 (the Extended Term Loan B-1 transaction) in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,640 million, (such portion referred to as the Extended Term Loan B-1), Change Healthcare temporary funding assistance of $393 million, net, pursuant to the CHC Funding Arrangement and a net draw of $260 million on our revolving line of credit in the six months ended June 30, 2024. Significant uses of cash during that same period included debt prepayments on Term Loan B-1 of $1,640 million as part of the Extended Term Loan B-1 transaction, and regularly scheduled principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $16 million on our Term Loan A-1 and $14 million on Term Loan B-1, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. Additionally, we recognized financing cash outflows of $13 million in deferred financing costs and discount related to the Fourth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement Extended Term Loan B1 transaction and $7 million in cap premium fees for our 2024 forward interest cap agreements. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 we used cash to repurchase 4,774,415 shares of our common stock.</p>
<p>By comparison, the same period in 2023 included the pay off of the remaining principal balance outstanding on our prior Term Loan A and prior revolving line of credit in the amount of $1,444 million and $150 million, respectively, and regularly scheduled and other principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $54 million on our prior Term Loan A and $43 million on Term Loan B-1, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. Additionally, we recognized financing cash outflows of $30 million in deferred financing costs related to the Second and Third Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and $15 million in cap premium fees for our 2023 forward interest cap agreements. Significant sources of cash during the period included the refinancing of our prior Term Loan A and revolving line of credit with a secured Term Loan A-1 facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250 million and a secured revolving line of credit with a net draw of $285 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Stock repurchases</h2>
<p>The following table summarizes our common stock repurchases during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024:</p>
<p>| | Three months ended June 30, 2024 | Three months ended June 30, 2024 | Three months ended June 30, 2024 | Six months ended June 30, 2024 | Six months ended June 30, 2024 | Six months ended June 30, 2024 |

| Open market repurchases: | 2,655,000 | $ 376 | $ 140.14 | 4,774,415 | 616 | $ 127.98 |</p>
<p>The Company did not repurchase any shares during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Available liquidity</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we had $1,240 million available and $260 million drawn on our $1.5 billion revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities. Credit available under this revolving line of credit is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding thereunder, of which there were none as of June 30, 2024. We separately had approximately $154 million in letters of credit outstanding under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.</p>
<p>See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates.</p>
<p>We believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. From time to time, depending on market conditions, our capital requirements and the availability of financing, among other things, we may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness. Our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K .</p>
<h2>Reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures</h2>
<p>The following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating income (loss) as presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for our U.S. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our U.S. IKC business, our U.S. other ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category, in addition to our corporate administrative support.</p>
<p>In connection with a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff, beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we have updated the presentation of our non-GAAP measures to no longer exclude center closure costs for all periods presented. To facilitate comparisons, the non-GAAP measures presented for prior periods also have been conformed to the presentation of the non-GAAP measures for the current period.</p>
<p>These non-GAAP or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our GAAP results. Specifically, management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe this non-GAAP measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. We also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations.</p>
<p>In addition, our effective income tax rate on income attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. We believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.</p>
<p>Finally, our free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests, development capital expenditures, and maintenance capital expenditures; plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. Management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities and other measures under GAAP.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures.</p>

<h2>Off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations</h2>
<p>In addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit, as well as certain working capital funding obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated dialysis ventures that we manage and some that we manage which are wholly-owned by third parties. For additional information see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>We also have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned dialysis partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. These obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. For additional information on these obligations and how we measure and report them, see Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report and Notes 16 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K.</p>
<p>For information on the maturities and other terms of our long-term debt, see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we have outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $154 million under a bilateral secured letter of credit facility separate from our senior secured credit facilities.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we have outstanding purchase agreements with various suppliers to purchase set amounts of dialysis equipment, parts, pharmaceuticals and supplies. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, we are required to pay the difference to the supplier, as described further in Note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K.</p>
<p>On March 5, 2024, we entered into four separate purchase agreements with Fresenius Medical Care to acquire their dialysis service operations in Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil. Chile and Ecuador closed during the first six months of 2024. Colombia and Brazil are expected to close during the second half of 2024 and remain subject to customary closing</p>
<p>conditions and regulatory approval as of June 30, 2024. Expected cash payments for these remaining transactions are approximately $180 million, subject to certain customary adjustments.</p>

<p>There has been no material change in the nature of the Company's interest rate risks or foreign currency exchange risks from those described in Part II Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of June 30, 2024. For further information on the components of the Company's long-term debt and their interest rates, see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q at Part I Item 1.</p>
<p>| | Expected maturity date | Expected maturity date | Expected maturity date | Expected maturity date | Expected maturity date | Expected maturity date | | | | Fair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | Thereafter | Total | Average interest rate | value (1) |
| | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) | (dollars in millions) |
| Long-term debt: | | | | | | | | | | |
| Fixed rate | $ 409 | $ 37 | $ 48 | $ 36 | $ 32 | $ 23 | $ 4,369 | $ 4,954 | 4.07 % | $ 4,229 |
| Variable rate | $ 56 | $ 110 | $ 992 | $ 99 | $ 1,263 | $ 18 | $ 1,556 | $ 4,094 | 4.64 % | $ 4,084 |</p>
<p>The scheduled principal payments for all debt that bears a variable rate by its terms, including all of Term Loan B-1, Extended Term Loan B-1, Term Loan A-1 and the revolving line of credit, have been included on the variable rate line of the schedule of expected maturities above and have been included in the calculation of the average variable interest rate presented. Additionally, the Change Healthcare temporary funding assistance, which is interest-free, has been included in the fixed rate line of the schedule of expected maturities and the calculation of the average fixed interest rate presented above.</p>
<p>However, principal amounts of $950 million for Term Loan B-1, $1,640 million for Extended Term Loan B-1 and $910 million of Term Loan A-1 (the capped debt) were effectively hedged by our 2019 interest rate cap agreements through June 30, 2024, with additional caps from our 2023 and 2024 interest rate cap agreements extending for further periods. As of June 30, 2024, applicable SOFR rates were above the 2.00% threshold of our cap agreements making the interest rates on this capped debt "economically fixed". As a result, as of June 30, 2024, total fixed and economically fixed debt was $8,454 million, with an average interest rate of 4.13%, while total variable rate debt not subject to caps was $594 million with an average rate of 7.51%.</p>
<p>See Note 7 for further details on the Company's interest rate cap agreements.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Management has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.</p>
<p>At the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with the Exchange Act requirements as of June 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the Exchange Act as of such date for our Exchange Act reports, including this report. Management recognizes that these controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of desired outcomes, and that estimates and judgments are still inherent in the process of maintaining effective controls and procedures.</p>
<p>There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that was identified during the evaluation that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
