We intend the forward-looking statements contained in this report to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of such Acts. Statements other than statements of historical or current fact in this report or referred to or incorporated by reference into this report are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. These statements include, among other things, the expected impact of COVID-19 on our business, the expected impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, any predictions, opinions, expectations, plans, strategies, objectives and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing relating to our current and future business and operations, including, but not limited to, financial matters, development activities, clinical trials and regulatory matters, manufacturing and supply operations, and product sales and demand. These statements can sometimes be identified by the use of the forward-looking words such as "may," "believe," "will," "expect," "project," "estimate," "should," "anticipate," "plan," "goal," "continue," "seek," "pro forma," "forecast," "intend," "guidance," "optimistic," "aspire," "confident," other forms of these words or similar words or expressions or the negative thereof. Statements regarding past performance, efforts, or results about which inferences or assumptions may be made can also be forward-looking statements and are not indicative of future performance or results; these statements can be identified by the use of words such as "preliminary," "initial," diligence," "industry-leading," "compliant," "indications," or "early feedback" or other forms of these words or similar words or expressions or the negative thereof. These forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or future business, financial condition, results of operations or performance to differ materially from our historical results or experiences or those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements contained in this report. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our success in developing new products and avoiding manufacturing and quality issues; clinical trial or commercial results or new product approvals and therapy adoption; the impact of domestic and global conditions; competitive dynamics in the markets in which we operate; our reliance on vendors, suppliers, and other third parties; damage, failure or interruption of our information technology systems; the impact of public health crises, including the COVID19 pandemic; consolidation in the healthcare industry; our ability to protect our intellectual property; our compliance with applicable regulations; our exposure to product liability claims; use of our products in unapproved circumstances; changes to reimbursement for our products; the impact of currency exchange rates; unanticipated actions by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies; changes to tax laws; unexpected impacts or expenses of litigation or internal or government investigations; and other risks detailed under "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as such risks and uncertainties may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

<p>The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated condensed financial statements.</p>
<h2>1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION</h2>
<p>The accompanying interim consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Edwards Lifesciences' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted.</p>
<p>The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company attributes the net income or losses of its consolidated variable interest entities to controlling and noncontrolling interests using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments, unless otherwise noted herein, are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.</p>
<p>There have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from those described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on investments in tax credit structures to allow entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial results.</p>

<h2>3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT AND LITIGATION EXPENSE (INCOME), NET</h2>
<p>On April 12, 2023, Edwards entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement (the "Intellectual Property Agreement") with Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") pursuant to which the parties agreed to a 15-year global covenant not to sue ("CNS") for infringement of certain patents in the structural heart space owned or controlled by each other. In consideration for the global CNS and related mutual access to certain intellectual property rights, Edwards paid to Medtronic a one-time, lump sum payment of $300.0 million and will pay annual royalty payments that are tied to net sales of certain Edwards products. Based upon the terms of the Intellectual Property Agreement, the Company identified the relevant elements for accounting purposes and allocated the $300.0 million upfront payment based on their respective fair values. The Company recorded a $37.0 million pre-tax charge in " Intellectual Property Agreement and Litigation Expense " in March 2023 related primarily to prior commercial sales incurred through March 31, 2023. The Company recorded a prepaid royalty asset of $124.0 million in April 2023 related to future commercial sales, which will be amortized to expense during the term of the Intellectual Property</p>
<p>Agreement. Separately, the Company recorded a $139.0 million pre-tax charge in " Intellectual Property Agreement and Litigation Expense " in April 2023 related to products currently in development.</p>
<h2>4. SPECIAL CHARGE</h2>
<p>In September 2022, the Company decided to exit its HARPOON surgical mitral repair system program. As a result, the Company recorded a charge to its United States segment of $68.4 million, of which $66.8 million was included in " Special Charge " and $1.6 million was included in " Cost of Sales " on the consolidated condensed statements of operations. The charge primarily related to the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology and other related exit costs. The Company believes that no additional contingent consideration is due and, in September 2022, recorded an $11.7 million contingent consideration gain associated with the exit.</p>

<p>The Company reviews its investments in debt securities to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Consideration is given to 1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including the credit quality of the security's issuer, 2) the Company's intent to sell the security, and 3) whether it is more likely than not the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. The decline in fair value of the debt securities was largely due to changes in interest rates, not credit quality, and as of September 30, 2023, the Company did not intend to sell the securities, and it was not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and, therefore, the unrealized losses are considered temporary.</p>
<h2>Investments in Unconsolidated Entities</h2>
<p>The Company has a number of equity investments in unconsolidated entities. These investments are recorded in " Long-term Investments " on the consolidated condensed balance sheets, and are as follows:</p>

<p>During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made $1.7 million of equity investments in limited liability companies that invest in qualified community development entities ("CDEs") through the New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program. The NMTC program provides federal tax incentives to investors to make investments in distressed communities and promotes economic improvements through the development of successful businesses in these communities. The NMTC is equal to 39% of the qualified investment and is taken over seven years. These limited liability companies are variable interest entities ("VIEs"). The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs and, therefore,</p>
<p>the Company does not consolidate these entities. Instead, the NMTC investments are accounted for as equity method investments.</p>
<p>Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and are reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had recorded cumulative upward adjustments of $8.8 million based on observable price changes, and cumulative downward adjustments of $3.1 million due to impairments and observable price changes.</p>
<p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gross realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale investments were not material.</p>
<h2>6. INVESTMENTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES</h2>
<p>The Company reviews its investments in other entities to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company would be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and would be required to consolidate the VIE, if it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant to the VIE. The Company's maximum loss exposure to variable interest entities, prior to the exercise of options to acquire the entities, is limited to its investment in the variable interest entities, which include equity investments, options to acquire, and promissory notes.</p>
<h2>Consolidated VIEs</h2>
<p>In February 2023, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in a medical technology company pursuant to a preferred stock purchase agreement, and amended and restated a previous option agreement to acquire the remaining equity interest. Edwards concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and consolidated the VIE. See Note 7 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Unconsolidated VIEs</h2>
<p>Edwards has relationships with various VIEs that it does not consolidate as Edwards lacks the power to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic success of these entities.</p>
<p>In March 2023, the Company agreed to pay a medical device company up to $45.0 million as consideration for an option to acquire the medical device company, of which $15.0 million had been paid as of September 30, 2023. Also, in March 2023, Edwards advanced $5.0 million to the medical device company under a convertible promissory note. The option and the note are included in " Other Assets " on the consolidated condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In April 2021, the Company entered into a $45.0 million secured promissory note agreement with a privately-held medical device company (the "Investee"), of which $25.0 million had been advanced as of September 30, 2023. Also in 2021, the Company invested $39.3 million, included in " Long-term Investments, " in the Investee's preferred equity securities and paid $13.1 million, included in " Other Assets, " for an option to acquire the Investee. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company may be required to invest up to an additional $6.5 million in the Investee's preferred equity securities and up to an additional $14.4 million for the option to acquire the Investee.</p>
<p>In August 2022, the Company entered into an option agreement with a medical device company. Under the option agreement, Edwards paid $47.1 million for an option to acquire the medical device company. The $47.1 million option is included in " Other Assets " on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note and amended its existing warrant agreement with a medical device company. Under the convertible promissory note agreement, the Company agreed to loan the medical device company up to $47.5 million, of which $32.5 million had been advanced as of September 30, 2023. In addition, in 2019 the Company paid $35.0 million for an option to acquire the medical device company. The $35.0 million option and the $32.5 million note receivable are included in " Other Assets " on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.</p>
<p>In May 2022, the Company entered into an option agreement with a medical technology company. Under the option agreement, Edwards paid $60.0 million for an option to acquire the medical technology company, of which $10.0 million was paid in 2021. The $60.0 million option is included in " Other Assets " on the consolidated condensed balance sheet. In addition, in August 2023, the Company entered into a $15 million promissory note with the medical technology company.</p>
<p>In addition, Edwards has made equity investments through the NMTC program in limited liability companies that are considered VIEs. For more information, see Note 5.</p>
<h2>7. BUSINESS COMBINATION</h2>
<p>On February 28, 2023, the Company acquired 61% of the then outstanding shares of a medical technology company in an all cash transaction. The Company determined it was the primary beneficiary of this VIE, and the VIE has been consolidated in the Company's consolidated condensed financial statements. In addition, the Company amended and restated its previous option agreement with the medical technology company. The option agreement gives Edwards the option to acquire the remaining equity interest in the medical technology company.</p>
<p>The medical technology company is dedicated to developing technologies for detecting and managing patients with cardiovascular disease. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):</p>

<p>Goodwill includes expected synergies and other benefits the Company believes will result from the acquisition. Goodwill was assigned to the Company's Rest of World segment and is not deductible for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Pro forma results have not been presented as the results of the medical technology company are not material in relation to the consolidated financial statements of Edwards Lifesciences.</p>
<h2>8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair values in one of the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1-Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>Level 2-Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.</p>
<p>The consolidated condensed financial statements include financial instruments for which the fair market value of such instruments may differ from amounts reflected on a historical cost basis. Financial instruments of the Company consist of cash deposits, accounts and other receivables, investments, accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities, and borrowings under a</p>
<p>revolving credit agreement. The carrying value of these financial instruments generally approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. Financial instruments also include notes payable. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the notes payable, based on Level 2 inputs, was $565.7 million.</p>

<h2>Cash Equivalents and Available-for-sale Investments</h2>
<p>Cash equivalents included money market funds for the periods presented above. The Company estimates the fair values of its money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company estimates the fair values of its corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, United States and foreign government and agency securities, and municipal securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services use industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades and brokerdealer quotes on the same or similar securities, benchmark yields, credit spreads, prepayment and default projections based on historical data, and other observable inputs. The Company independently reviews and validates the pricing received from the third-party pricing service by comparing the prices to prices reported by a secondary pricing source. The Company's validation procedures have not resulted in an adjustment to the pricing received from the pricing service.</p>
<h2>Deferred Compensation Plans</h2>
<p>The Company holds investments in trading securities related to its deferred compensation plans. The investments are in a variety of stock, bond and money market mutual funds. The fair values of these investments are based on quoted market prices.</p>
<h2>Derivative Instruments</h2>
<p>The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. All derivatives contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments was estimated based on quoted market foreign exchange rates, cross currency swap basis rates, and market discount rates. Judgment was employed in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value; accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.</p>
<h2>Contingent Consideration Liabilities</h2>
<p>Certain of the Company's acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements. Payment of additional consideration is contingent upon the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones, such as attaining specified sales levels or obtaining regulatory approvals. These contingent consideration liabilities are measured at estimated fair value using either a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis or a Monte Carlo simulation model, both of which consider significant unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2023, the probability of milestone achievement was determined to be 0% and, accordingly, the contingent consideration liability waszero.</p>

<p>Derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the counterparty should default. It is the Company's policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that the Company believes to be creditworthy. The Company diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. The Company also uses International Swap Dealers Association master-netting agreements. The master-netting</p>
<p>agreements provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default, as defined by the agreements.</p>
<p>The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from (a) future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain local currency expenses expected to occur within approximately 1 year (designated as cash flow hedges), (b) its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries (designated as net investment hedges) and (c) foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities (designated as fair value hedges). The Company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains and losses associated with revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies (resulting principally from intercompany and local currency transactions).</p>
<p>All derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated condensed balance sheets. For each derivative instrument that is designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item. The Company reports in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges. The Company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same line item and in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are reported in " Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss " as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment and would be reclassified into earnings if the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated. The portion of the change in fair value related to components excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment are amortized into earnings over the life of the derivative. The gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument. Cash flows from net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and cash flows from all other derivative financial instruments are reported as operating activities.</p>

<p>At September 30, 2023, the total remaining compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") subscription awards amounted to $254.5 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over each award's requisite service period. The weightedaverage remaining requisite service period is 33 months.</p>
<p>During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted2.0 million stock options at a weighted-average exercise price per share of $88.45, and 1.0 million restricted stock units at a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $87.36. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company also granted 0.1 million market-based restricted stock units at a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $110.10. The market-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 vest based on a combination of certain service and market conditions. The actual number of shares issued will be determined based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group over a three-year performance period and may range from0% to 175% of the target number of shares granted.</p>
<h2>Fair Value Disclosures</h2>
<p>The fair value of market-based restricted stock units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fair value of the market-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 included a risk-free interest rate of 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively, and an expected volatility rate of32.6% and 33.9%, respectively.</p>

<h2>11. ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE</h2>
<p>During 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreements providing for the repurchase of the Company's common stock based on the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of the Company's common stock during the term of the applicable agreement, less a discount. The following table summarizes the terms of the ASR agreements (dollars and shares in millions, except per share data):</p>

<p>The ASR agreements were each accounted for as two separate transactions: (1) the value of the initial delivery of shares was recorded as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction on the acquisition date, and (2) the remaining amount of the purchase price paid was recorded as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common stock and was initially recorded in " Additional Paid-in Capital " and subsequently, upon settlement, was transferred to " Treasury Stock " on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company determined that the forward contracts indexed to the Company's common stock met all the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, were not accounted for as a derivative instrument.</p>
<h2>12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<p>In 2021, the Company initiated an internal review and investigation into whether business activities in Japan and other markets violated certain provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). The Company voluntarily notified the SEC and the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") during 2021 that it has engaged outside counsel to conduct this review and investigation. The Company has provided status updates to the SEC and DOJ since that time. Any determination that the Company's operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws, including the FCPA, could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and equitable remedies. The Company cannot currently predict the final outcome of the investigation or any potential impact on its financial statements.</p>
<p>On September 28, 2021, Aortic Innovations LLC, a non-practicing entity, filed a lawsuit against Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries ("Edwards") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Edwards' SAPIEN 3 Ultra product infringes certain of its patents. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of possible exposure; therefore, no amounts have been accrued. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.</p>
<p>The Company is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits including those related to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by the Company, workplace and employment matters, matters involving real estate, Company operations or health care regulations, contingent considerations, or governmental investigations (the "Lawsuits"). The Lawsuits raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. Management does not believe that any loss relating to the Lawsuits would have a material adverse effect on the Company's overall financial condition, results of</p>
<p>operations or cash flows. However, the resolution of one or more of the Lawsuits in any reporting period, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results for that period. The Company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies related to the Lawsuits for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved.</p>

<h2>14. EARNINGS PER SHARE</h2>
<p>Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include employee equity share options, nonvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the Company. Potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.</p>

<p>Stock options, restricted stock units, and market-based restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of6.5 million and 4.0 million common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 6.1 million and 3.1 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for such periods because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.</p>
<h2>15. INCOME TAXES</h2>
<p>The Company's effective income tax rates were12.7% and 15.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and12.5% and 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2 022, respectively. The decrease in the effective rate between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to the impact of temporary relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") relating to U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. On July 21, 2023, the IRS issued Notice 2023-55 which delayed the application of certain U.S. foreign tax credit regulations that had previously limited the Company's ability to claim credits on certain foreign taxes for tax years 2022 and 2023. In addition, there was an increase in the benefit from the federal research and development credit and the Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic (see Note 3), partially offset by a reduced tax benefit from employee share-based compensation. The effective rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, (2) Federal and California research and development credits, and (3) the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation. The effective rates include a tax benefit from employee share-ba sed compensation of $1.9 million and $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $14.2 million and $36.7 million for the nin e months ended September 30, 2023 a nd 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the IRS and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of the Company's tax filings. During these audits the Company may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The Company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While the Company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is materially different from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the gross liability recorded for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $ 542.9 million and $475.3 million, respectively. The Company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $226.4 million and $182.1 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. The net amounts of $316.5 million and $293.2 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect the Company's effective tax rate.</p>
<p>The Company executed an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") in 2018 between the United States and Switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various, but not all, transfer pricing matters. The unagreed transfer pricing matters, namely Surgical Structural Heart and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (collectively "Surgical/TAVR") intercompany royalty transactions, then reverted to IRS Examination for further consideration as part of the respective years' regular tax audits. In addition, the Company executed other bilateral APAs as follows: during 2017, an APA between the United States and Japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019; and during 2018, APAs between Singapore and Japan and between Switzerland and Japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019. The Company has filed to renew all three of the APAs with Japan for the years 2020 and forward. An APA between Switzerland and Japan covering tax years 2020 through 2024 was executed in 2021. The execution of some or all of these APA renewals depends on many variables outside of the Company's control.</p>
<p>The audits of the Company's United States federal income tax returns through 2014 have been closed. The IRS audit field work for the 2015 through 2017 tax years was completed during the second quarter of 2021, except for certain transfer pricing and related matters. The IRS began its examination of the 2018 through 2020 tax years during the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The audits of the Company's material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015. While not material, the Company continues to address matters in India for years from 2010 and on.</p>
<p>During 2021, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") from the IRS for the 2015-2017 tax years relating to transfer pricing involving Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions between the Company's United States and Switzerland subsidiaries. The NOPA proposed an increase to the Company's United States taxable income, which could result in additional tax expense for this period of approximately $220 million and reflects a departure from a transfer pricing method the Company had previously agreed upon with the IRS. The Company disagreed with the NOPA and submitted a formal protest on the matter during the fourth quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company received the IRS's rebuttal to the Company's protest and was notified that the case had been transferred to the IRS Independent Office of</p>
<p>Appeals ("Appeals"). The opening conference was held with Appeals during March 2023 and discussions with Appeals continued into the third quarter of 2023. While Appeals still maintains jurisdiction over the matter as of September 30, 2023, the Company and Appeals have concluded that a satisfactory resolution of this matter at the administrative level is not possible.</p>
<p>The Company plans to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this matter is not likely within the next 12 months. The Company believes the amounts previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position are appropriate for a number of reasons, including the interpretation and application of relevant tax law and accounting standards to the Company's facts and, accordingly, has not accrued any additional amount based on the NOPA received or as a result of the Appeals proceedings to date. Nonetheless, the outcome of the judicial process cannot be predicted with certainty, and it is possible that the outcome of that process could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. As noted below, similar material tax disputes may arise for the 2018-2023 tax years. While no payment of any amount related to the NOPA has yet been required, the Company made a partial deposit in November 2022 to prevent the further accrual of interest on that portion of any potential deficiency that may be ultimately sustained.</p>
<p>Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions covering tax years 2018-2023 remain subject to IRS examination, and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of September 30, 2023. The Company has considered this information, as well as information regarding the NOPA, the rebuttal and Appeals discussions described above, in its evaluation of its uncertain tax positions. The impact of these unresolved transfer pricing matters, net of any correlative tax adjustments, may be significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, the Company cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in its existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and, therefore, has continued to record the uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.</p>
<h2>16. SEGMENT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Edwards Lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World. All regions sell products that are used to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The Company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer). The Company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and operating income. Segment net sales and segment operating income are based on internally derived foreign exchange rates and do not include inter-segment profits. Because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent. Net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer. There were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company's total net sales.</p>
<p>Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments. The non-allocated items include corporate research and development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, net interest income, global marketing expenses, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, and most of the Company's amortization expense. Although most of the Company's depreciation expense is included in segment operating income, due to the Company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level. The Company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Uncertainties</h2>
<p>While conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved compared to 2022, we have continued to experience the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, particularly in Japan and disruptions related to staffing shortages in the United States and Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted, and may further adversely impact, aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners. Our priority has been to maintain access for patients to our life-saving technologies while providing continuous front-line support to our clinician partners, and protecting the well-being of our employees. Our manufacturing operations have continued to respond to impacts related to COVID-19, and we have been able to supply our technologies around the world. Across our organization, we are proactively managing inventory, assessing alternative logistics options, and closely monitoring the supply of components to address potential supply constraints.</p>
<p>In addition to the impacts described above, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, continues to experience extreme volatility and disruptions, including inflationary conditions, rising interest rates, declines in consumer confidence, and uncertainty about economic growth and stability. The severity and duration of the impact of these conditions on our business cannot be predicted. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for additional information.</p>
<h2>Financial Highlights</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges to our business due to COVID-19 and macroeconomic factors, our net sales for the first nine months of 2023 were $4.5 billion, representing an increase of $436.6 million over the first nine months of 2022, driven primarily by sales of our TAVR products.</p>
<p>Our gross profit increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by our sales growth. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The decrease in our diluted earnings per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by an after-tax charge of $138.7 million related to an intellectual property agreement. See Note 3 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements " for further information. Healthcare Environment, Opportunities, and Challenges</p>
<p>The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. Our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested 17.9% of our net sales in research and development.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.</p>

<h2>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Sales</h2>
<p>Net sales of TAVR products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li>· higher sales of the Edwards SAPIEN platform in 2023, primarily the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the United States;</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales outside of the United States by $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, and decreased net sales outside of the United States by $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the first nine months of 2023, we continued to enroll our PROGRESS pivotal trial, studying moderate aortic stenosis patients. In March 2023, we launched the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in Japan. In July 2023, we announced the restart of enrollment in our pivotal trial, ALLIANCE, designed to study our next generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4 .</p>
<h2>Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies Sales</h2>
<p>1477</p>
<p>Net sales of TMTT products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the launch of our PASCAL system in the United States and its continued adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of 2023, we continued to enroll the CLASP IIF pivotal trial with PASCAL for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, we completed enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3. In tricuspid, we completed the enrollment of the full cohort of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement system. In the United States, in December 2022, the Food and Drug Administration approved continued access allowing hospitals that were involved in the clinical trial to continue to have EVOQUE as a therapy option. In October 2023, we received CE Mark approval in Europe for EVOQUE and we received approval in Japan for PASCAL Precision to treat patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. In addition, enrollment continued in the CLASP IITR pivotal trial with the PASCAL repair system in patients with symptomatic, severe tricuspid regurgitation.</p>
<h2>Surgical Structural Heart Sales</h2>
<p>2408</p>
<p>Net sales of Surgical products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased sales of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in the United States and Europe, and the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the United States. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales outside of the United States by $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, and decreased net sales outside of the United States by $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.</p>
<p>We are continuing to enroll patients in our MOMENTIS clinical study to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. In October 2023, we received CE Mark approval for our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve.</p>
<h2>Critical Care Sales</h2>
<p>3158</p>
<p>Net sales of Critical Care products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· increased demand for our enhanced surgical recovery products and pressure monitoring products, primarily in the United States;</li>
</ul>
<h2>partially offset by:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales outside of the United States by $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar, and decreased net sales outside of the United States by $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the United States dollar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross Profit</p>
<p>3616</p>
<p>The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a 4.1 percentage point and 2.3 percentage point decrease, respectively, from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the weakening of the United States dollar against the Euro.</p>
<h2>Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG&amp;A") Expenses</h2>
<p>3967</p>
<p>SG&amp;A expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher performance-based compensation and higher field-based personnelrelated costs, primarily TAVR and TMTT in the United States. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased expenses by $5.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the weakening of the United States dollar against the Euro, and decreased expenses by $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the strengthening of the United States dollar against multiple foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>R&amp;D expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.</p>
<h2>Intellectual Property Agreement and Litigation Expense (Income), net</h2>
<p>We incurred intellectual property agreement and litigation expenses of $2.2 million and income of $2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and expenses of $193.6 million and $10.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On April 12, 2023, we entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement (the "Intellectual Property Agreement") with Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") and recorded a $37.0 million charge in March 2023 and a $139.0 million charge in April 2023. For more information, see Note 3 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements ."</p>
<h2>Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities</h2>
<p>The change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in gains of $26.2 million and $36.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The gains in 2023 were primarily due to changes in projected probabilities of milestone achievement. The gains in 2022 were due to changes in projected probabilities of milestone achievement and our decision in the third quarter of 2022 to exit our HARPOON surgical mitral repair system program.</p>
<h2>Special Charge</h2>
<p>In September 2022, we decided to exit our HARPOON surgical mitral repair system program. As a result, we recorded a charge of $68.4 million, of which $66.8 million was included in " Special Charge " and $1.6 million was included in " Cost of Sales " on the consolidated condensed statements of operations. The charge primarily related to the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology and other related exit costs. We believe that no additional contingent consideration is due and, in September 2022, recorded an $11.7 million contingent consideration gain associated with the exit.</p>
<h2>Provision for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States which have statutory tax rates typically lower than the United States tax rate. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates.</p>
<p>Our effective income tax rate was 12.7% and 15.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 12.5% and 14.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the effective rate between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to the imp act of temporary relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") relating to U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. On July 21, 2023, the IRS</p>
<p>issued Notice 2023-55 which delayed the application of certain U.S. foreign tax credit regulations that had previously limited our ability to claim credits on certain foreign taxes for tax years 2022 and 2023. In addition, there is an increase in the benefit from the Federal research and development credit and the Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic (see Note 3 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements "), partially offset by a reduced tax benefit from employee share-based compensation. Th e effective rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, (2) Federal and California research and development credits, and (3) the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the IRS and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of our tax filings. During these audits we may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the eventual outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is materially different from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.</p>
<p>We executed an Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") in 2018 between the United States and Switzerland governments for tax years 2009 through 2020 covering various, but not all, transfer pricing matters. The unagreed transfer pricing matters, namely Surgical Structural Heart and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (collectively "Surgical/TAVR") intercompany royalty transactions, then reverted to IRS Examination for further consideration as part of the respective years' regular tax audits. In addition, we executed other bilateral APAs as follows: during 2017, an APA between the United States and Japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019; and during 2018, APAs between Singapore and Japan and between Switzerland and Japan covering tax years 2015 through 2019. We have filed to renew all three of the APAs with Japan for the years 2020 and forward. An APA between Switzerland and Japan covering tax years 2020 through 2024 was executed in 2021. The execution of some or all these APA renewals depends on many variables outside of our control.</p>
<p>The audits of our United States federal income tax returns through 2014 have been closed. The IRS audit field work for the 2015 through 2017 tax years was completed during the second quarter of 2021, except for certain transfer pricing and related matters. The IRS began its examination of the 2018 through 2020 tax years during the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>The audits of our material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015. While not material, we continue to address matters in India for years from 2010 and on.</p>
<p>During 2021, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") from the IRS for the 2015-2017 tax years relating to transfer pricing involving Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions between our United States and Switzerland subsidiaries. The NOPA proposed an increase to our United States taxable income, which could result in additional tax expense for this period of approximately $220 million and reflects a departure from a transfer pricing method we had previously agreed upon with the IRS. We have disagreed with the NOPA and submitted a formal protest on the matter during the fourth quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2022, we received the IRS's rebuttal to our protest and were notified that the case had been transferred to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals ("Appeals"). The opening conference was held with Appeals during March 2023 and discussions with Appeals continued into the third quarter of 2023. While Appeals still maintains jurisdiction over the matter as of September 30, 2023, we and Appeals have concluded that a satisfactory resolution of this matter at the administrative level is not possible.</p>
<p>We plan to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process. Final resolution of this matter is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe the amounts previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position are appropriate for a number of reasons, including the interpretation and application of relevant tax law and accounting standards to our facts and, accordingly, have not accrued any additional amount based on the NOPA received or as a result of the Appeals proceedings to date. Nonetheless, the outcome of the judicial process cannot be predicted with certainty, and it is possible that the outcome of that process could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As noted below, similar material tax disputes may arise for the 2018-2023 tax years. While no payment of any amount related to the NOPA has yet been required, we made a partial deposit in November 2022 to prevent the further accrual of interest on that portion of any potential deficiency that may ultimately be sustained.</p>
<p>Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions covering tax years 2018-2023 remain subject to IRS examination, and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of September 30, 2023. We have considered this information, as well as information regarding the NOPA, the rebuttal and Appeals discussions described above, in our evaluation of our uncertain tax positions. The impact of these unresolved transfer pricing matters, net of any correlative tax adjustments, may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. Based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and, therefore, have continued to record the uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.</p>
<p>On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA") was signed into law. The IRA includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15% minimum tax based on "adjusted financial statement income," which is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, and a one percent excise tax on net repurchases of stock after December 31, 2022. Based upon our analysis to date, we do not expect the IRA will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>Our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under credit facilities. We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and long-term requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the United States and outside of the United States were $1.3 billion and $523.9 million, respectively.</p>
<p>We have a Five-year Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") which provides for a $750.0 million multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility and matures on July 15, 2027. We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate and extend the maturity date for an additional year, subject to agreement of the lenders. As of September 30, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>In June 2018, we issued $600.0 million of 4.3% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the "2018 Notes") due June 15, 2028. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of the 2018 Notes was $596.8 million.</p>
<p>From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, under the Board authorized repurchase program, we repurchased a total of 5.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $422.8 million. See Part II, Item 2, " Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, " for additional information about our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2023, we had remaining authority to purchase $492.8 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program.</p>
<p>On April 12, 2023, we entered into the Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic pursuant to which the parties agreed to a 15-year global covenant not to sue ("CNS") for infringement of certain patents in the structural heart space owned or controlled by each other. In consideration for the global CNS, we paid Medtronic a one-time, lump sum payment of $300.0 million and will pay annual royalty payments that are tied to net sales of certain Edwards products. For more information, see Note 3 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements ."</p>
<p>On February 28, 2023, we acquired a majority equity interest in a medical technology company. In addition, we amended and restated our previous option agreement with the medical technology company. The option agreement gives us the option to acquire the remaining equity interest in the medical technology company. For more information, see Note 7 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements ."</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, there had been no material changes in our cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, as disclosed in Item 7, " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Consolidated Cash Flows - For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:</h2>
<p>Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $759.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased $176.2 million over the same period last year primarily due to a $300.0 million payment in 2023 under the Intellectual Property Agreement, partially offset by a higher bonus payout in 2022 associated with 2021 performance.</p>
<p>Net cash provided by investing activities of $159.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of net proceeds from investments of $541.1 million, partially offset by a payment of $141.2 million to acquire a majority interest in another company (see Note 7 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements ") and capital expenditures of $164.7 million.</p>
<p>Net cash provided by investing activities of $157.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of net proceeds from investments of $474.7 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $175.7 million and payments of 107.6 million for options to acquire other companies. For further information, see Note 6 to the " Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements ."</p>
<p>Net cash used in financing activities of $297.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $431.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $136.7 million.</p>
<p>Net cash used in financing activities of $746.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $861.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $118.9 million.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>The consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated condensed financial statements and sales and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies and estimates which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained on pages 34-36 in Item 7, " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, " of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no significant changes from the information discussed therein.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk, Foreign Currency Risk, Credit Risk, and Concentrations of Risk</h2>
<p>For a complete discussion of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, and concentrations of risk, refer to Item 7A " Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk " in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes from the information discussed therein.</p>
<h2>Investment Risk</h2>
<p>We are exposed to investment risks related to changes in the underlying financial condition and credit capacity of certain of our investments. As of September 30, 2023, we had $1.0 billion of investments in debt securities, of which $0.6 billion were long-term. In addition, we had $109.8 million of investments in equity instruments of public and private companies. Should these companies experience a decline in financial performance, financial condition or credit capacity, or fail to meet certain development milestones, a decline in the investments' value may occur, resulting in unrealized or realized losses. See Note 5 to the "Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements" for additional information.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2023. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of September 30, 2023 that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>Part II. Other Information</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In 2021, we initiated an internal review and investigation into whether business activities in Japan and other markets violated certain provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). We voluntarily notified the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") during 2021 that we engaged outside counsel to conduct this review and investigation. We have provided status updates to the SEC and DOJ since that time. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws, including the FCPA, could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and equitable remedies. We cannot currently predict the final outcome of the investigation or any potential impact on our financial statements.</p>
<p>On September 28, 2021, Aortic Innovations LLC, a non-practicing entity, filed a lawsuit against Edwards Lifesciences Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries ("Edwards") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Edwards' SAPIEN 3 Ultra product infringes certain of its patents. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of possible exposure; therefore, no amount has been accrued. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation.</p>
<p>We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the United States. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on our financial results. Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in the " Risk Factors " section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously reported.</p>
