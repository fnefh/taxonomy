Such statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcomes of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
<p>All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe, or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.

</ul>
<p>Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Availability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices;</li>
<li>· Development and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources;</li>
<li>· The impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental matters, and litigation, as well as our ability and the ability of other energy companies with whom we conduct or seek to conduct business, to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and our ability to achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;</li>
<li>· Our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;</li>
<li>· Our ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities and consummate asset sales on acceptable terms;</li>
<li>· Whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities;</li>
<li>· The strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;</li>
<li>· The amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;</li>
<li>· Whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan;</li>
<li>
<p>· Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>· The physical and financial risks associated with climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>· The impacts of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions;</li>

<li>· Risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;</li>
<li>· Acts of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions;</li>
<li>· Our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;</li>
<li>· Changes in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction-related inputs, including skilled labor;</li>
<li>· Inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers);</li>
<li>· Risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital;</li>
<li>· The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls and the impact on domestic production;</li>
<li>· Changes in the current geopolitical situation, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, including between Israel and Hamas and conflicts involving Iran and its proxy forces;</li>
<li>· Changes in U.S. governmental administration and policies;</li>
<li>· Whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends;</li>
<li>· Additional risks described in our filings with the SEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to, and do not intend to, update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.</p>
<p>In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of those factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, as may be supplemented by disclosures in Part II, Item 1A.

<h2>The Williams Companies, Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<h2>Note 1 - General, Description of Business, and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>Our accompanying interim consolidated financial statements do not include all the notes in our annual financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying unaudited financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments and others that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly our interim financial statements.</p>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, references in this report to "Williams," "we," "our," "us," or like terms refer to The Williams Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, references to "Williams," "we," "our," and "us" include the operations in which we own interests accounted for as equity-method investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements. When we refer to our equity investees by name, we are referring exclusively to their businesses and operations.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>In September 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $1.5 billion. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner as determined by our management. Our management will also determine the timing and amount of any repurchases based on market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. This share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, there have been $0 and $130 million in repurchases under the program which are included in our Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Cumulative repurchases to date under the program total $139 million.</p>

<p>We believe that the carrying value of certain of our property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, notably certain acquired assets accounted for as business combinations between 2012 and 2014, may be in excess of current fair value. However, the carrying value of these assets, in our judgment, continues to be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that future strategic decisions, including transactions such as monetizing assets or contributing assets to new ventures with third parties, as well as unfavorable changes in expected producer activities, could impact our assumptions and ultimately result in impairments of these assets. Such transactions or developments may also indicate that certain of our equity-method investments have experienced other-than-temporary declines in value, which could result in impairment.</p>
<h2>Discontinued operations</h2>
<p>During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $115 million to Income (loss) from discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Income related to litigation associated with our former Alaska refinery, which was settled in January 2024. Except for this item and unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations.</p>
<h2>Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and expanded interim disclosures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have a material impact on our financial statements.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on our financial statements.</p>
<h2>Note 2 - Variable Interest Entities</h2>
<h2>Consolidated VIEs</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we consolidate the following VIEs:</p>
<h2>Northeast JV</h2>
<p>We own a 65 percent interest in the Northeast JV, a subsidiary that is a VIE due to certain of our voting rights being disproportionate to our obligation to absorb losses and substantially all of the Northeast JV's activities being performed on our behalf. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Northeast JV's economic performance. The Northeast JV provides midstream services for producers in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale regions. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner on a proportional basis.</p>
<h2>Gulfstar One</h2>
<p>We own a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One, a subsidiary that, due to certain risk-sharing provisions in its customer contracts, is a VIE. Gulfstar One includes a proprietary floating-production system, Gulfstar FPS, and associated pipelines that provide production handling and gathering services in the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Gulfstar One's economic performance.</p>
<h2>Cardinal</h2>
<p>We own a 66 percent interest in Cardinal, a subsidiary that provides gathering services for the Utica Shale region and is a VIE due to certain risks shared with customers. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cardinal's economic performance. In order to meet contractual gas gathering commitments, we may fund more than our proportional share of future expansion activity, which could ultimately impact relative ownership.</p>
<p>The following table presents amounts included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are only for the use or obligation of our consolidated VIEs:</p>

<h2>Nonconsolidated VIEs</h2>
<p>We own certain equity-method investments that are VIEs due primarily to our limited participating rights as a minority equity holder. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of these investments, which totaled $73 million at June 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures</h2>
<h2>Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition</h2>
<p>On January 3, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of100 percent of a strategic portfolio of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, located in Louisiana and Mississippi, from Hartree Partners LP (Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition) for $1.95 billion. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our natural gas storage footprint in the Gulf Coast region. Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized are included within our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment. The Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition was funded with cash on hand and $100 million of deferred consideration that does not accrue interest and is payable one year from the acquisition date. The obligation is presented within Long-term debt due within one year in our Consolidated Balance Sheet owed by our wholly owned subsidiary Williams Field Services Group, LLC.</p>
<p>During the period from the acquisition date of January 3, 2024 to June 30, 2024, the operations acquired in the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition contributed Revenues of $112 million and Modified EBITDA (as defined in Note 10 - Segment Disclosures) of $81 million, which is impacted by acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs for the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition total $14 million, including $13 million incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2024 included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>We accounted for the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition as a business combination, which requires, among other things, that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values. The valuation technique used consisted of the cost approach for property, plant, and equipment.</p>
<p>The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at January 3, 2024. The allocation is considered preliminary because the valuation work has not been completed due to the ongoing review of the valuation results and validation of significant inputs and assumptions. Preliminary fair value measurements were made for certain acquired assets and liabilities, primarily property, plant, and equipment; however, adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as new information related to facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date may be identified. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired, included in Other current assets in the following table, equals contractual amounts receivable.</p>

<h2>DJ Basin Acquisitions</h2>
<h2>Cureton Acquisition</h2>
<p>On November 30, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of100 percent of Cureton Front Range, LLC (Cureton Acquisition), whose operations are located in the DJ Basin, for $546 million, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our gathering and processing footprint and create operational synergies for our operations in the DJ Basin. Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized are included within our West segment. The Cureton Acquisition was funded with cash on hand.</p>
<p>During the period from the acquisition date of November 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the operations acquired in the Cureton Acquisition contributed Revenues of $35 million and Modified EBITDA of $7 million.</p>
<p>Acquisition-related costs for the Cureton Acquisition total $7 million, including $1 million incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2024, included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>We accounted for the Cureton Acquisition as a business combination. The valuation techniques used consisted of the cost approach for property, plant, and equipment and the income approach for valuation of other intangible assets.</p>
<p>The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at November 30, 2023.

<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>Other intangible assets recognized in the Cureton Acquisition are related to contractual customer relationships from gas gathering and processing agreements with our customers. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets is estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired contractual customer relationships discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an initial period of 20 years which represents the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Approximately 24 percent of the expected future revenues from these contractual customer relationships are impacted by our ability and intent to renew or renegotiate existing customer contracts. We expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the current contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the existing contractual customer relationships is approximately 10 years.</p>
<h2>RMM Acquisition</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, we owned a50 percent interest in RMM which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On November 30, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in RMM (RMM Acquisition) for $704 million. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control and now consolidate RMM. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our gathering and processing footprint and create operational synergies for our operations in the DJ Basin. Assets acquired and results of operations realized are included within our West segment. Substantially all of the RMM purchase price is not due to the seller until the first quarter of 2025, does not accrue interest until the fourth quarter of 2024, and may be repaid early without penalty. It was recorded as a deferred consideration obligation at fair value using an income approach, which resulted in a discount to the contractual amount due which will be imputed as interest expense over the term of the obligation. The obligation is presented within Long-term debt due within one year in our Consolidated Balance Sheet owed by our wholly owned subsidiary Williams Rocky Mountain Midstream Holdings LLC.</p>
<p>During the period from the acquisition date of November 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023, RMM contributed Revenues of $53 million and Modified EBITDA of $12 million.</p>
<p>We accounted for the RMM Acquisition as a business combination. The book value of our existing equity-method investment prior to the acquisition date of November 30, 2023, was $406 million. We recognized a $30 million gain on remeasuring our existing equity-method investment to fair value included in Other investing income (loss) - net in our Consolidated Statement of Income during 2023. The valuation techniques used consisted of the income approach for our previous equity-method investment in RMM and the valuation of other intangible assets, and the cost approach for property, plant, and equipment.</p>
<p>The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at November 30, 2023. The net assets acquired primarily reflect the noncash consideration transferred, which includes the fair value of both our previous equity-method investment and the deferred consideration obligation. The allocation is considered preliminary because the valuation work has not been completed due to the ongoing review of the valuation results and validation of significant inputs and assumptions. Preliminary fair value measurements were made for certain acquired assets and liabilities, primarily property, plant, and equipment and other intangible assets; however, adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as new information related to facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date may be identified. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired, included in Other current assets in the following table, equals contractual amounts receivable.</p>

<p>Goodwill recognized in the RMM Acquisition relates primarily to enhancing and diversifying our basin positions as well as delivering operational synergies, including increasing volumes on our existing processing facilities and increasing revenues on our NGL transportation, fractionation, and storage assets, and is reported within our West segment. Substantially all of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is included within Intangible assets - net of accumulated amortization in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and represents the excess of the consideration, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest or any previously held equity interest, over the fair value of the net assets acquired. It is not subject to amortization but is evaluated annually as of October 1 for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As part of the evaluation, we compare our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference (not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill). Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management's estimates of fair value.</p>
<p>Other intangible assets recognized in the RMM Acquisition are related to contractual customer relationships from gas gathering and processing agreements with our customers. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets is estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired contractual customer relationships discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an initial period of 20 years which represents the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Approximately 18 percent of the expected future revenues from these contractual customer relationships are impacted by our ability and intent to renew or renegotiate existing customer contracts. We expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the current contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the existing contractual customer relationships is approximately 10 years.</p>
<h2>MountainWest Acquisition</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of100 percent of MountainWest, which includes Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and natural gas storage capacity (MountainWest Acquisition), for $ 1.08 billion of cash, funded with available sources of shortterm liquidity, and retaining $430 million outstanding principal amount of MountainWest long-term debt. For 2023,</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>$1.024 billion is presented in Purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflecting the cash purchase price, reduced for post-closing adjustments and the cash acquired as presented in the purchase price allocation. The purpose of the MountainWest Acquisition was to expand our existing transmission and storage infrastructure footprint into major markets in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized are included within our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment.</p>
<p>During the period from the acquisition date of February 14, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the operations acquired in the MountainWest Acquisition contributed Revenues of $225 million and Modified EBITDA of $122 million, which includes $27 million of transition-related costs.</p>
<p>Acquisition-related costs for the MountainWest Acquisition total $17 million, including $13 million incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2023, included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>We accounted for the MountainWest Acquisition as a business combination. The valuation techniques used consisted of the cost approach for nonregulated property, plant, and equipment, as well as the market approach for the assumed long-term debt consistent with the valuation technique discussed in Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements and Guarantees. MountainWest's regulated operations are accounted for pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, "Regulated Operations." The fair value of assets and liabilities subject to rate making and cost recovery provisions were determined utilizing the income approach. MountainWest's expected return on rate base is consistent with expected returns of similarly situated assets, resulting in carryover basis of these assets and liabilities equaling their fair value.</p>
<p>The following table presents the allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at February 14, 2023. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired equals contractual amounts receivable.</p>

<h2>Remaining Performance Obligations</h2>
<p>Remaining performance obligations primarily include reservation charges on contracted capacity for our gas pipeline firm transportation contracts with customers, storage capacity contracts, long-term contracts containing MVC associated with our midstream businesses, and fixed payments associated with offshore production handling. For our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses, remaining performance obligations reflect the rates for such services in our current FERC tariffs for the life of the related contracts; however, these rates may change based on future tariffs approved by the FERC and the amount and timing of these changes are not currently known.</p>
<p>Our remaining performance obligations exclude variable consideration, including contracts with variable consideration for which we have elected the practical expedient for consideration recognized in revenue as billed. Certain of our contracts contain evergreen and other renewal provisions for periods beyond the initial term of the contract. The remaining performance obligation amounts as of June 30, 2024, do not consider potential future performance obligations for which the renewal has not been exercised and exclude contracts with customers for which the underlying facilities have not received FERC authorization to be placed into service. Consideration received prior to June 30, 2024, that will be recognized in future periods is also excluded from our remaining performance obligations and is instead reflected in contract liabilities.</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>

<h2>Fair Value Methods</h2>
<p>We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments:</p>
<p>Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis</p>
<p>ARO Trust investments: Transco deposits a portion of its collected rates, pursuant to its rate case settlement, into an external trust (ARO Trust) that is specifically designated to fund future asset retirement obligations (ARO). The ARO Trust invests in a portfolio of actively traded mutual funds that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted prices in an active market and is reported in Regulatory assets, deferred charges, and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are ultimately recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>Commodity derivatives: Commodity derivatives include exchange-traded contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts, which consist of physical forwards, futures, and swaps that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We also have other derivatives related to asset management agreements and other contracts that require physical delivery. Derivatives classified as Level 1 are valued using New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures prices. Derivatives classified as Level 2 are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers. Derivatives classified as Level 3 are valued using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The fair value amounts are presented on a net basis and reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of our master netting arrangements and cash held on deposit in margin accounts that we have received or remitted to collateralize certain derivative positions. Commodity derivative assets are reported in Derivative assets and Regulatory assets, deferred charges, and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet . Commodity derivative liabilities are reported in Derivative liabilities and Regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in Net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives and Net processing commodity expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 8 - Commodity Derivatives for additional information on our derivatives.</p>
<p>Interest rate derivatives: At December 31, 2023, we held forward starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.15 billion. During January 2024 we terminated certain of these agreements totaling $750 million of notional value coinciding with the issuance of long-term debt (see Note 6 - Debt and Banking Arrangements). During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into new agreements totaling $200 million of notional value. The fair value of these derivatives is determined using discounted cash flows considering forward interest rates and the terms of the agreements, corroborated by counterparty valuations, and is classified as a Level 2 measurement. We designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. Gains and losses on these derivative instruments are reflected as a component of AOCI and, after the termination of the swap agreement, are amortized to earnings over the term of the related debt as a component of Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income. These forward starting interest rate swaps are reported in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>Additional fair value disclosures</h2>
<p>Long-term debt, including current portion: The disclosed fair value of our long-term debt is determined primarily by a market approach using broker quoted indicative period-end bond prices. The quoted prices are based on observable transactions in less active markets for our debt or similar instruments. The fair values of the financing obligations associated with our Dalton, Leidy South, and Atlantic Sunrise projects, as well as the deferred consideration obligations associated with the RMM Acquisition and the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition (see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures), all included within long-term debt, were determined using an income approach.</p>
<p>Guarantees: Guarantees primarily consist of a guarantee we have provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group, Inc., (WilTel), on a lease performance obligation that extends through 2042. Guarantees also include an indemnification related to a disposed operation.</p>
<p>To estimate the fair value of the WilTel guarantee, an estimated default rate is applied to the sum of the future contractual lease payments using an income approach. The estimated default rate is determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted default rate based on the credit rating of WilTel's current owner and the term of the underlying obligation. The default rate is published by Moody's Investors Service. The carrying value of the WilTel guarantee is reported in Accrued and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The maximum potential undiscounted liquidity exposure is approximately $22 million at June 30, 2024. Our exposure declines systematically through the remaining term of WilTel's obligation.</p>
<p>The fair value of the guarantee associated with the indemnification related to a disposed operation was estimated using an income approach that considered probability-weighted scenarios of potential levels of future</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>performance. The terms of the indemnification do not limit the maximum potential future payments associated with the guarantee. The carrying value of this guarantee is reported in Regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<p>We are required by our revolving credit agreement to indemnify lenders for certain taxes required to be withheld from payments due to the lenders and for certain tax payments made by the lenders. The maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnifications is based on the related borrowings and such future payments cannot currently be determined. These indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations and have no carrying value. We have never been called upon to perform under these indemnifications and have no current expectation of a future claim.</p>
<h2>Note 8 - Commodity Derivatives</h2>
<p>We are exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, we use various contracts in our marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, value at risk. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis by counterparty, net of margin deposits. See Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements and Guarantees for additional fair value information. In our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, any cash impacts of settled commodity derivatives are recorded as operating activities.</p>
<p>We enter into commodity derivatives to economically hedge exposures to natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect our results of operations.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024, the notional volume of the net long (short) positions for our commodity derivative contracts were as follows:</p>

<h2>Contingent Features</h2>
<p>Generally, collateral may be provided in the form of a parent guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.</p>
<p>We have specific trade and credit contracts that contain minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, we would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with these counterparties. At June 30, 2024, the contractually required collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade to noninvestment grade status was $15 million.</p>
<p>We maintain accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, we may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At June 30, 2024, net cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $143 million.</p>
<h2>Note 9 - Contingencies</h2>
<h2>Royalty Matters</h2>
<p>Certain of our customers, including Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake), have been named in various lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties and claiming, among other things, violations of anti-trust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. We have also been named as a defendant in certain of these cases filed in Pennsylvania based on allegations that we improperly participated with Chesapeake in causing the alleged royalty underpayments. We believe that the claims asserted are subject to indemnity obligations owed to us by Chesapeake, which obligations survived Chesapeake's bankruptcy proceedings. Prior to its bankruptcy, Chesapeake reached a settlement to resolve substantially all Pennsylvania royalty cases pending. During the pendency of the bankruptcy, that settlement was renegotiated. The settlement applies to both Chesapeake and us and does not require any contribution from us. On August 23, 2021, after referral to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas by the bankruptcy court, the court approved the settlement. Two objectors filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 8, 2023, the Court of Appeals vacated</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>the settlement approval and remanded to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas with instructions to dismiss the settlement proceedings for lack of jurisdiction. On August 31, 2023, the bankruptcy court entered an order finding the settlement agreements to be null and void. Certain plaintiffs have filed a notice of dismissal of their claims against Chesapeake that arose prior to February 8, 2021, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania lawsuits. The notice states that plaintiffs are not releasing their claims against the other defendants, including us, or claims against Chesapeake that arose after February 9, 2021. We continue to believe the claims against us are subject to indemnity obligations owed to us by Chesapeake.</p>
<h2>Environmental Matters</h2>
<p>We are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own. We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred, or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental laws. As of June 30, 2024, we have accrued liabilities totaling $43 million for these matters, as discussed below. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At June 30, 2024, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors.</p>
<p>The EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, reviews and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compound and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to Property, plant, and equipment - net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of these regulatory impacts at this time.</p>
<h2>Continuing operations</h2>
<p>Our interstate gas pipelines are involved in remediation and monitoring activities related to certain facilities and locations for polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, and other hazardous substances. These activities have involved the EPA and various state environmental authorities, resulting in our identification as a potentially responsible party at various Superfund waste sites. At June 30, 2024, we have accrued liabilities of $12 million for these costs and expect to recover approximately $4 million through rates.</p>
<p>We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and groundwater contamination. At June 30, 2024, we have accrued liabilities totaling $6 million for these costs.</p>
<h2>Former operations</h2>
<p>We have potential obligations in connection with assets and businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations include remediation activities at the direction of federal and state environmental authorities and the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of these assets and businesses for environmental and other liabilities</p>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<p>existing at the time the sale was consummated. At June 30, 2024, we have accrued environmental liabilities of $25 million related to these matters.</p>
<h2>Other Divestiture Indemnifications</h2>
<p>Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2024, other than as previously disclosed, we are not aware of any material claims against us involving the above-described indemnities. Any claim for indemnity brought against us in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the claim is made.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are pending against us that are incidental to our operations, none of which are expected to be material to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We have disclosed our estimated range of reasonably possible losses for certain matters above, as well as all significant matters for which we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. We estimate that for all other matters for which we are able to reasonably estimate a range of loss, our aggregate reasonably possible losses beyond amounts accrued are immaterial to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. These calculations have been made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties.</p>
<h2>Note 10 - Segment Disclosures</h2>
<p>Our reportable segments are Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&amp;P, West, and Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services. All remaining business activities are included in Other. (See Note 1 - General, Description of Business, and Basis of Presentation.)</p>
<h2>Performance Measurement</h2>
<p>We evaluate segment operating performance based upon Modified EBITDA . This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure used by our chief operating decision maker in measuring performance and allocating resources among our reportable segments. Intersegment Service revenues primarily represent transportation services provided to our marketing business and gathering services provided to our oil and gas properties. Intersegment Product sales primarily represent the sale of natural gas and NGLs from our natural gas processing plants and our oil and gas properties to our marketing business.</p>
<p>We define Modified EBITDA as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Net income (loss) before:</li>
<li>· Income (loss) from discontinued operations;</li>
<li>· Provision (benefit) for income taxes;</li>
<li>· Interest expense;</li>
<li>· Equity earnings (losses);</li>
<li>· Other investing income (loss) - net;</li>
<li>· Depreciation and amortization expenses;</li>
<li>· Accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<ul>
<li>· This measure is further adjusted to include our proportionate share (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA from our equity-method investments calculated consistently with the definition described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant noncash items which are components of Modified EBITDA may include unrealized net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives within Total revenues, unrealized net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives within Net processing commodity expenses for our Gas &amp; NGL Marketing segment, charges associated with lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our inventory within Product sales and Product costs , and impairments of certain assets within Other (income) expense - net within Operating income (loss) .</p>
<p>The following table reflects the reconciliation of Modified EBITDA to Net income (loss) as reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income:</p>

<h2>Notes (Continued)</h2>
<h2>Note 11 - Subsequent Events</h2>
<h2>Discovery Acquisition</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we owned a60 percent interest in Discovery which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On August 1, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 40 percent interest in Discovery, along with certain other assets, for $170 million, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control and will consolidate Discovery. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our gathering, processing, and transportation footprint in the Gulf of Mexico region. Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized will be included within our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment. Due to the recent timing, the initial purchase price accounting for the transaction was not available at the time of filing.</p>
<h2>Sale of Aux Sable Interest</h2>
<p>Also on August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our equity-method investments in Aux Sable Liquid Products Inc., Aux Sable Liquid Products LP, and Aux Sable Midstream LLC (collectively, "Aux Sable") for total consideration of $160 million. As a result of this sale, we expect to record a gain in the third quarter of 2024 in our Northeast G&amp;P segment.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>We are an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Our operations are located in the United States.</p>
<p>Our interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high-quality, low-cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. Our gas pipeline businesses' interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC's ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and FERC policy. Changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.</p>
<p>The ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. These services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and storage, NGL fractionation, transportation and storage, crude oil production handling and transportation, as well as marketing services for NGL, crude oil, and natural gas.</p>
<p>Consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&amp;P, West, and Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services. All remaining business activities, including our upstream operations and corporate activities, are included in Other. Our reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco, Northwest Pipeline, and MountainWest, and their related natural gas storage facilities, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery (see Note 11 - Subsequent Events). Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico also includes natural gas storage facilities and pipelines providing services in north Texas, and also in Louisiana and Mississippi related to the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition (see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures).</li>
<li>· Northeast G&amp;P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in Northeast JV which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal which operates in Ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments.</li>
<li>
<p>· West is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of east Texas and northwest Louisiana, the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko and Permian basins, and the DJ Basin of Colorado which includes RMM, a former 50 percent equity-method investment in which we acquired the remaining ownership interest in November 2023 (see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures). This segment also includes our NGL storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>· Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services is comprised of our NGL and natural gas marketing and trading operations, which includes risk management and transactions related to the storage and transportation of natural gas and NGLs on strategically positioned assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 dated February 21, 2024.</p>
<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>In June 2024, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.4750 per share.</p>
<h2>Overview of Six Months Ended June 30, 2024</h2>
<p>Net income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2024, decreased $354 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Further discussion of our results is found in this report in the Results of Operations.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h2>Expansion Project Updates</h2>
<p>Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico</p>
<h2>Regional Energy Access</h2>
<p>In January 2023, we received approval from the FERC for the project to expand Transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from receipt points in northeastern Pennsylvania to multiple delivery points in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. We placed approximately half of the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2023 and placed the remainder of the project into service in August 2024. The project increased capacity by 829 Mdth/d.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted petitions for review of the FERC orders approving the project, vacating such orders and remanding the matter to the FERC for appropriate action. The court's decision will not be effective until the court has issued its mandate (which is not expected to occur until mid-September 2024 at the earliest), so the decision will not have an immediate impact on the project or the service being rendered through the project capacity. We will take the necessary legal and regulatory actions to ensure that the project capacity continues to be available to serve the needs of our customers without interruption.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions and Divestitures</h2>
<h2>Discovery Acquisition</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, we owned a 60 percent interest in Discovery which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On August 1, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 40 percent interest in Discovery, along with certain other assets, for $170 million, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control and will consolidate Discovery. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our gathering, processing, and transportation footprint in the Gulf of Mexico region. Assets acquired, acquisition-related costs incurred, and results of operations realized will be included within our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment (see Note 11 - Subsequent Events).</p>
<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)</h2>
<h2>Sale of Aux Sable Interest</h2>
<p>Also on August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our equity-method investments in Aux Sable for total consideration of $160 million. As a result of this sale, we expect to record a gain in the third quarter of 2024 in our Northeast G&amp;P segment (see Note 11 - Subsequent Events).</p>
<h2>Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition</h2>
<p>On January 3, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of a strategic portfolio of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, located in Louisiana and Mississippi, from Hartree Partners LP for $1.95 billion. The purpose of this acquisition, which is reported in the Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment, was to expand our natural gas storage footprint in the Gulf Coast region. The Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition was funded with cash on hand and $100 million of deferred consideration (see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures).</p>
<h2>Company Outlook</h2>
<p>Our strategy is to provide a large-scale, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States. We accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. We continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship including seeking opportunities for renewable energy ventures, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. We believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe, reliable, clean energy services to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. Our business plan for 2024 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth.</p>
<p>In 2024, our operating results are expected to benefit from the recent Gulf Coast Storage and DJ Basin acquisitions. We also anticipate increases resulting from Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico expansion projects, including the Regional Energy Access project, and annual inflation-based rate increases across our gathering and processing business. These increases are partially offset by lower expected Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services results, the absence of realized hedge gains captured in 2023 in the West, and a decrease in expected volumes primarily in the Appalachian and Haynesville basins associated with a lower expected commodity price environment.</p>
<p>We seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of safe, clean, and reliable energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the United States. Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from $1.45 billion to $1.75 billion, excluding acquisitions. Growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the Haynesville Basin, and projects supporting the Northeast G&amp;P business. We also expect to invest capital in our Other business ventures. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.</p>
<p>Potential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· A global recession, which could result in downturns in financial markets and commodity prices, as well as impact demand for natural gas and related products;</li>
<li>· Opposition to, and regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;</li>
<li>
<p>· Counterparty credit and performance risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>· Unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution, including increases from inflation or delays caused by supply chain disruptions;</p>
</li>
<li>· Unexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes;</li>
<li>· Lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower-than-expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins;</li>
<li>· General economic, financial markets, or industry downturns, including increased inflation and interest rates;</li>
<li>· Physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by weather-related events;</li>
<li>· Other risks set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, as may be supplemented by disclosure in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.</li>

<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)</h2>
<p>Three months ended June 30, 2024 vs. three months ended June 30, 2023</p>
<p>Service revenues increased primarily due to higher volumes from the November 2023 DJ Basin Acquisitions at our West segment and the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage acquisition at our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment (see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures), and higher revenues associated with an expansion project at our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment; partially offset by lower gathering volumes at our Northeast G&amp;P and West Segments.</p>
<p>The net sum of Product sales and service revenues - commodity consideration , Product costs and net processing commodity expenses, and net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to sales of product and shrink gas purchases for our processing plants for our reportable segments comprise our Commodity Margins . Service revenues - commodity consideration represent payments we receive in the form of commodities for processing services provided. Most of these commodity volumes are sold during the month processed and are offset within Product costs and net processing commodity expenses . The sum of Product sales and net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to our upstream operations comprise Net realized product sales .</p>
<p>The Product sales and service revenues - commodity consideration increase primarily consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Higher net natural gas marketing sales and purchases volumes, partially offset by lower net prices;</li>
<li>· Higher NGL marketing sales primarily due to higher non-ethane prices, partially offset by lower ethane volumes and prices; partially offset by</li>
<li>· Lower system management gas sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers, our natural gas marketing product sales are presented net of the related costs of those activities within our Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services segment.</p>
<p>Net gain (loss) from commodity derivatives includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments reflected within Total revenues primarily in our Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services and West segments, and at Other (see Note 8 - Commodity Derivatives).</p>
<p>We experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage capacity portfolios as well as upstream-related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage capacity contracts, which are not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs.</p>
<p>The Product costs and net processing commodity expenses decrease primarily consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Lower system management gas purchases; partially offset by</li>
<li>· Higher non-ethane prices, partially offset by lower ethane volumes for our NGL marketing activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to operating costs of the assets acquired at our West and Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segments.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily related to assets acquired at our West and Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segments.</p>
<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)</h2>
<p>Equity earnings (losses) changed unfavorably primarily due to the consolidation of RMM following our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in November 2023 and a decrease at Blue Racer, partially offset by favorable results at OPPL.</p>
<p>The increase in Interest expense was primarily due to our 2023 and 2024 debt issuances, and imputed interest on deferred consideration obligations related to our DJ Basin and Gulf Coast Storage acquisitions, partially offset by 2023 and 2024 debt retirements (see Note 6 - Debt and Banking Arrangements).</p>
<p>Provision (benefit) for income taxes changed favorably primarily due to lower pre-tax income. See Note 5 - Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.</p>
<p>Income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2023 includes a pre-tax charge of $115 million to increase the accrued liability associated with our Alaska refinery contamination litigation, partially offset by the related income tax effect.</p>
<p>Six months ended June 30, 2024 vs. six months ended June 30, 2023</p>
<p>Service revenues increased primarily due to higher volumes from the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage and February 2023 MountainWest acquisitions at our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment and the November 2023 DJ Basin Acquisitions at our West segment, and higher revenues associated with an expansion project at our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment.</p>
<p>The Product sales and service revenues - commodity consideration increase primarily consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Higher net natural gas marketing sales primarily due to higher sales and purchases volumes substantially offset by lower net prices and higher storage costs;</li>

<h2>Period-Over-Period Operating Results - Segments</h2>
<p>We evaluate segment operating performance based upon Modified EBITDA . Note 10 - Segment Disclosures includes a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to Net income (loss) . Management uses Modified EBITDA because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. Modified EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>

<p>Modified EBITDA of other business activities increased primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· A $5 million increase in Net realized product sales from our upstream operations primarily due to higher production volumes, partially offset by lower net realized commodity prices;</li>
<li>· A $7 million favorable change in Other segment costs and expenses related to lower corporate costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity</h2>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from $1.45 billion to $1.75 billion, excluding acquisitions. Growth capital spending in 2024 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting growth in the Haynesville Basin, and projects supporting the Northeast G&amp;P business. We also expect to invest capital in our Other business ventures. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. We intend to fund substantially all planned 2024 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. We retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities including the repurchase of our common stock.</p>
<p>On January 3, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of a strategic portfolio of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, located in Louisiana and Mississippi for $1.95 billion. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and $100 million of deferred consideration that does not accrue interest and is payable one year from the acquisition date.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2024, we completed the Discovery Acquisition for $170 million. Also, on August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of certain equity-method investments for $160 million (see Note 11 - Subsequent Events).</p>
<p>On January 5, 2024, we issued $2.1 billion in long-term debt. We retired long-term debt of $1.0 billion on March 4, 2024, and $1.25 billion on June 24, 2024 (see Note 6 - Debt and Banking Arrangements).</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we have approximately $1.536 billion of long-term debt due within one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash on hand, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.</p>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>Based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2024. Our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows:</p>

<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)</h2>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we have approximately $24.1 billion of long-term debt due after one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash generated from operations, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.</p>
<p>Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in Company Outlook .</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of $2.581 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. Our available liquidity is as follows:</p>

<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>We increased our regular quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by approximately 6.1 percent from the $0.4475 per share paid in each quarter of 2023, to $0.4750 per share paid in March and June 2024.</p>
<h2>Registrations</h2>
<p>In February 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer.</p>
<h2>Distributions from Equity-Method Investees</h2>
<p>The organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require periodic distributions of their available cash to their members. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses.</p>
<h2>Credit Ratings</h2>
<p>The interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. The current ratings are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rating Agency</th>
<th>Outlook</th>
<th>Senior Unsecured Debt Rating</th>

<p>In April 2024, S&amp;P Global Ratings changed its Outlook from Stable to Positive.</p>
<p>These credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. No assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current</p>
<h2>Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)</h2>
<p>criteria for investment-grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and, if ratings were to fall below investment-grade, could require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity.</p>

<h2>Operating activities</h2>
<p>The factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect Net income (loss) , with the exception of noncash items such as Depreciation and amortization , Provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes , Equity (earnings) losses , Net unrealized (gain) loss from commodity derivative instruments , Inventory write-downs, and Amortization of stock-based awards.</p>
<p>Our Net cash provided (used) by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased from the same period in 2023 primarily due to unfavorable changes in margin requirements and net operating working capital partially offset by higher operating income (excluding non-cash items previously discussed).</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. Our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. Any borrowings under our credit facility and any issuances under our commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. The maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. We may utilize interest rate derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk associated with future debt issuances (see Note 6 - Debt and Banking Arrangements).</p>
<h2>Commodity Price Risk</h2>
<p>We are exposed to commodity price risk through our natural gas and NGL marketing activities, including contracts to purchase, sell, transport, and store product. We routinely manage this risk with a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts such as forward contracts, futures contracts, and basis swaps, as well as physical transactions. Although many of the contracts used to manage commodity exposure are derivative instruments, these economic hedges are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.</p>
<p>We are also exposed to commodity prices through our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. We use derivative instruments to lock in forward sales prices on a portion of our expected future production and to lock in NGL margin on a portion of our commodity-exposed gathering and processing volumes. These economic hedges are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.</p>
<p>The maturities of our commodity derivative contracts at June 30, 2024 were as follows:</p>

<h2>Value at Risk (VaR)</h2>
<p>VaR is the maximum predicted loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Our VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Our VaR is determined using parametric models with 95 percent confidence intervals and one-day holding periods, which means that 95 percent of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. Our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of predicted financial loss to management. Because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets, our open exposure is generally mitigated. We employ daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of our positions.</p>
<p>We actively monitor open commodity marketing positions and the resulting VaR and maintain a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk.</p>
<p>The VaR associated with our integrated natural gas trading operations was $3 million at June 30, 2024 and $9 million at December 31, 2023. We had the following VaRs for the period shown:</p>

<p>Our non-trading portfolio primarily consists of commodity derivatives that hedge our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. The VaR associated with these commodity derivatives was $4 million at June 30, 2024 and $3 million at December 31, 2023. We had the following VaRs for the period shown:</p>

<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<h2>Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>As disclosed in Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures, we acquired Hartree as part of the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition on January 3, 2024. Hartree's total revenues constituted approximately 2 percent of total revenues as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Hartree's total assets constituted approximately 4 percent of total assets as shown in our consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024. We also acquired Cureton on November 30, 2023, and its total revenues constituted approximately 4 percent of total revenues as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Cureton's total assets constituted approximately 1 percent of total assets as shown in our consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024. We excluded Hartree's and Cureton's disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by their internal control over financial reporting from the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of recent business combinations may be omitted from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes during the second quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II. OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<h2>Environmental</h2>
<p>Certain reportable legal proceedings involving governmental authorities under federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment are described below. While it is not possible for us to predict the final outcome of the proceedings that are still pending, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position if we receive an unfavorable outcome in any one or more of such proceedings. Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.</p>
