## CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") and certain other communications made by us contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including, among others, expected performance, future operating results, oil and natural gas demand and prices and the outlook for the oil and gas industry, future global economic conditions, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, improvements in operating procedures and technology, our business strategy and the business strategies of our customers, in addition to other estimates, and beliefs. For this purpose, any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward-looking statement. We may use the words "estimate," "outlook," "project," "forecast," "position," "potential," "likely," "believe," "anticipate," "assume," "plan," "expect," "intend," "achievable," "may," "will," "continue," "should," "could" and similar expressions to help identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. Important factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in our most recently filed Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2022, this Quarterly Report, and other filings that we make with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise and readers should not rely on the forward-looking statements as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events.

All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

## Note 1-Organization and Basis of Presentation

## Organization

Liberty Energy Inc., formerly known as Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (the "Company"), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 21, 2016, to become a holding corporation for Liberty Oilfield Services New HoldCo LLC ("Liberty LLC") and its subsidiaries upon completion of a corporate reorganization (the "Corporate Reorganization") and planned initial public offering of the Company ("IPO"). On April 19, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of changing the Company's name from "Liberty Oilfield Services Inc." to "Liberty Energy Inc." and thereafter, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reflect the new name, effective April 25, 2022. Effective January 31, 2023, Liberty LLC was merged into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the "Merger"). In connection with the Merger, all outstanding shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock") were redeemed and exchanged for an equal number of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"). The Company did not make any distributions or receive any proceeds in connection with this exchange. Please refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 10, 2023 (the "Annual Report"), for additional information on the Merger completed on January 31, 2023, and the Corporate Reorganization and IPO that were completed on January 17, 2018.

The Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading integrated energy services and technology company focused on providing innovative hydraulic fracturing services and related technologies to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production ("E&P") companies in North America. We offer customers hydraulic fracturing services, together with complementary services including wireline services, proppant delivery solutions, field gas processing, compressed natural gas ("CNG") delivery, data analytics, related goods (including our sand mine operations), and technologies that will facilitate lower emission completions, thereby helping our customers reduce their emissions profile.

## Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information or notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read together with the annual financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes present the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the results of operations and equity of the Company as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the entire fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Further, these estimates and other factors, including those outside the Company's control, such as the impact of sustained lower commodity prices, could have a significant adverse impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

All intercompany amounts have been eliminated in the presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Company's operations are organized into a single reportable segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing and related goods and services.

## Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies

## Transaction, Severance, and Other Costs

The Company incurred transaction related costs in connection with the Siren Acquisition (as defined below). Such costs include investment banking, legal, accounting, and other professional services provided in connection with closing the transaction and are expensed as incurred.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires that the acquiring entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The Company adopted this guidance effective December 15, 2022 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

## Siren Acquisition

On April 6, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a Permian focused integrated natural gas compression and compressed natural gas delivery business, Siren Energy ("Siren"), for cash consideration of $76.0 million (the "Siren Acquisition"). The Siren Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the Company conducted assessments of the net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. In connection with the Siren Acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $42.0 million, property and equipment of $34.9 million, net working capital of $2.5 million, deferred revenue of $5.2 million, and other assets of $1.8 million. Goodwill is recorded in other assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Due to the immateriality of the Siren Acquisition, the related revenue and earnings, supplemental pro forma financial information, and detailed purchase price allocation are not disclosed.

In accordance with ASC Topic 805, an acquirer is allowed a period, referred to as the measurement period, in which to complete its accounting for the transaction. Such measurement period ends at the earliest date that the acquirer a) receives the information necessary or b) determines that it cannot obtain further information, and such period may not exceed one year. As the Siren Acquisition closed on April 6, 2023, the Company is in the process of completing the initial purchase price allocation.

## Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified including $2.3 million from accrued liabilities to income taxes payable in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets to conform to the presentation of the current period financial statements. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company combined amounts previously presented within "Effect of exchange on deferred tax asset, net of liability under tax receivable agreements" and " Deferred tax impact of ownership changes from issuance of Class A Common Stock" into "Deferred tax and tax receivable agreements impact of the Liberty LLC merger into the Company" in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net income or loss.

## Lessor Arrangements

The Company leases dry and wet sand containers and conveyor belts to customers through operating leases, where the lessor for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. The lease agreements do not include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value. However, some of the leases contain a termination clause in which the customer can cancel the contract. The leases can be subject to variable lease payments if the customer requests more units than what is agreed upon in the lease. The Company does not record any lease assets or liabilities related to these variable items.

On September 19, 2017, the Company entered intotwo credit agreements: (i) a revolving line of credit up to $250.0 million, subsequently increased to $525.0 million, see below, (the "ABL Facility") and (ii) a $175.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan Facility", and together with the ABL Facility the "Credit Facilities").

Effective January 23, 2023, the Company entered into an Eighth Amendment to the ABL Facility (the "Eighth ABL Amendment"). The Eighth ABL Amendment amends certain terms, provisions and covenants of the ABL Facility, including, among other things: (i) increasing the maximum revolver amount from $425.0 million to $525.0 million (the "Upsized Revolver"); (ii) increasing the amount of the accordion feature from $75.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) extending the maturity date from October 22, 2026 to January 23, 2028; (iv) modifying the dollar amounts of various credit facility triggers and tests proportionally to the Upsized Revolver; (v) permitting repayment under the Term Loan Facility prior to February 10, 2023; and (vi) increasing certain indebtedness, intercompany advance, and investment baskets. The Eighth ABL Amendment also includes an agreement from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, to release its second priority liens and security interests on all collateral that served as first priority collateral under the Term Loan Facility. This release was completed during the three months ended June 30, 2023.

Additionally, on January 23, 2023, the Company borrowed $106.7 million on the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to pay off and then terminate the Term Loan Facility. The amount paid includes the balance of the Term Loan Facility upon pay off of $104.7 million, $0.9 million of accrued interest, and a $1.1 million prepayment premium or 1% of the principal. Additionally, there were $0.2 million in bank and legal fees incurred in connection with the pay off.

The weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was7.4% and 9.0%, respectively.

## Term Loan Facility

The Term Loan Facility provided for a $175.0 million term loan. In connection with the Eighth ABL Amendment and payoff of the Term Loan Facility, on January 23, 2023, the Company terminated the Term Loan Facility, see above for further discussion.

## ABL Facility

Under the terms of the ABL Facility, up to $525.0 million may be borrowed, subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Based on the September 30, 2023 financials, the borrowing base was calculated to be $521.2 million, and the Company had $223.0 million outstanding in addition to letters of credit in the amount of $2.6 million, with $295.6 million of remaining availability. Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at

SOFR or a base rate, plus an applicable SOFR margin of1.5% to 2.0% or base rate margin of 0.5% to 1.0%, as described in the ABL Facility credit agreement (the "ABL Facility credit agreement"). Additionally, borrowings as of September 30, 2023 incurred interest at a weighted average rate of 7.4%. The average monthly unused commitment is subject to an unused commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375%. Interest and fees are payable in arrears at the end of each month, or, in the case of SOFR loans, at the end of each interest period. The ABL Facility matures on January 23, 2028. Borrowings under the ABL Facility are collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory, and further secured by the Company as parent guarantor.

The ABL Facility includes certain non-financial covenants, including but not limited to restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions. Moreover, the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and to make distributions is dependent on maintaining a maximum leverage ratio.

The ABL Facility is not subject to financial covenants unless liquidity, as defined in the ABL Facility credit agreement, drops below a specific level. The Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the ABL Facility credit agreement, of 1.0 to 1.0 for each period if excess availability is less than 10% of the borrowing base or $52.5 million, whichever is greater.

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2023.

## Note 8-Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities represent the amounts that would be received to sell those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction on the reporting date. These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability on the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company discloses the fair values of its assets and liabilities according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:

- · Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 Inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.

The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborating market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities that are initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborating market data is no longer available. Transfers occur at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and finance and operating lease obligations. These financial instruments do not require disclosure by level. The carrying values of all of the Company's financial instruments included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets approximated or equaled their fair values on September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

- · The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable (including accrued liabilities) approximated fair value on September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, due to their short-term nature.

(Unaudited)

- · The carrying value of amounts outstanding under long-term debt agreements with variable rates approximated fair value on September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as the effective interest rates approximated market rates.
- · The carrying values of amounts outstanding under finance and operating lease obligations approximated fair value on September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as the effective borrowing rates approximated market rates.

## Nonrecurring Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but may be subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities include those acquired through the Siren Acquisition, which are required to be measured at fair value on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC Topic 805 . See Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $0.7 million of land and $0.8 million of buildings of one property that met the held for sale criteria, to assets held for sale at a total fair value of $0.8 million, which are included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimated the fair value of the property based on a communicated selling price for one property, which is a Level 3 input. The Company estimates that the carrying value of the assets is equal to the fair value less the estimated costs to sell, net of write-downs taken in the prior period, and therefore no gain or loss was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $1.1 million of land and $6.2 million of buildings of two properties that met the held for sale criteria, to assets held for sale at a total fair value of $6.3 million, which are included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company estimated the fair value of the properties based on a purchase and sale agreement for one property and a communicated selling price, which are Level 3 inputs.

## Recurring Measurements

The fair values of the Company's cash equivalents measured on a recurring basis pursuant to ASC 820-10 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures are carried at estimated fair value. Cash equivalents consist of money market accounts which the Company has classified as Level 1 given the active market for these accounts. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had cash equivalents, measured at fair value, of $0.3 million.

## Nonfinancial assets

The Company estimates fair value to perform impairment tests as required on long-lived assets. The inputs used to determine such fair value are primarily based upon internally developed cash flow models and would generally be classified within Level 3 in the event that such assets were required to be measured and recorded at fair value within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. No such measurements were required as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 as no triggering event was identified.

## Credit Risk

The Company's financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and trade receivables.

The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances on deposit with financial institutions total$26. 6 million and $43.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which exceeded FDIC insured limits. The Company regularly monitors these institutions' financial condition.

The majority of the Company's customers have payment terms of 45 days or less.

As of September 30, 2023, customer A accounted for13% of total consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. As of December 31, 2022, customer A accounted for 11% of total consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, no customers accounted for 10% of consolidated revenues. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, customer A accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, no customers accounted for 10% of consolidated revenues.

The Company mitigates the associated credit risk by performing credit evaluations and monitoring the payment patterns of its customers.

## Share Repurchase Program

On July 25, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized and the Company announced a share repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to $250.0 million of the Company's Class A Common Stock beginning immediately and continuing through and including July 31, 2024. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the Board authorized and the Company announced an increase to the share repurchase program that increased the Company's cumulative repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management's assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company's Class A Common Stock, the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company's debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under the ABL Facility and expected free cash flow to be generated through the duration of the share repurchase program.

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired1,784,899 shares of Class A Common Stock for $29.3 million, or $16.40 average price per share including commissions, under the share repurchase program.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired11,673,886 shares of Class A Common Stock for $164.0 million, or $14.05 average price per share including commissions, under the share repurchase program.

As of September 30, 2023, $211.0 million remained authorized for future repurchases of Class A Common Stock under the share repurchase program.

The Company accounts for the purchase price of repurchased common shares in excess of par value ($0.01 per share of Class A Common Stock) as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, and will continue to do so until additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero. Thereafter, any excess purchase price will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.

As enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA"), the Company accrued stock repurchase excise tax of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

## Note 10-Net Income per Share

Basic net income per share measures the performance of an entity over the reporting period. Diluted net income per share measures the performance of an entity over the reporting period while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period. The Company uses the "if-converted" method to determine the potential dilutive effect of its Class B Common Stock and the treasury stock method to determine the potential dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and PSUs.

The following table reflects the allocation of net income to common stockholders and net income per share computations for the periods indicated based on a weighted average number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding:

Certain supply agreements contain a clause whereby in the event that the Company fails to purchase minimum volumes, as defined in the agreement, during a specific time period, a shortfall fee may apply. In circumstances where the Company does not make the minimum purchase required under the contract, the Company and its suppliers have a history of amending such minimum purchase contractual terms and in rare cases does the Company incur shortfall fees. If the Company were unable to make any of the minimum purchases and the Company and its suppliers cannot come to an agreement to avoid such fees, the Company could incur shortfall fees in the amounts of $31.0 million and $17.7 million for the remainder of 2023 and the year ending December 31, 2024, respectively. Based on forecasted levels of activity, the Company does not currently expect to incur significant shortfall fees.

Included in the commitments for the remainder of 2023 are $3.6 million of payments expected to be made in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the use of certain light duty trucks, heavy tractors and field equipment used to various degrees in frac and wireline operations.

## Item 2. Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described in "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," the Annual Report under the heading "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and in "Part II - Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors" included herein. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.

## Overview

The Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading integrated energy services and technology company focused on providing innovative hydraulic fracturing services and related technologies to onshore oil and natural gas E&P companies in North America. We offer customers hydraulic fracturing services, together with complementary services including wireline services, proppant delivery solutions, field gas processing and treating, CNG delivery, data analytics, related goods (including our sand mine operations), and technologies that will facilitate lower emission completions, thereby helping our customers reduce their emissions profile. We have grown from one active hydraulic fracturing fleet in December 2011 to over 40 active fleets as of September 30, 2023. We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the DJ Basin, the Williston Basin, the San Juan Basin, the Powder River Basin, the Haynesville Shale, the SCOOP/STACK, the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Additionally, we operate two sand mines in the Permian Basin.

The Company recently launched Liberty Power Innovations ("LPI"), an integrated alternative fuel and power solutions provider for remote applications. LPI's initial focus is on CNG supply, field gas processing and treating, and well site fueling and logistics. Dependable access to fuel is critical to maintaining highly efficient well site operations. LPI supplies this fuel to Liberty and others in the industry.

On April 6, 2023, LPI accelerated its expansion by acquiring Siren, a Permian focused integrated natural gas compression and CNG delivery business with 16 MMcf per day of natural gas compression capacity at two expandable Permian sites and transportation, logistics, and pressure reduction services, for $76.0 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. LPI currently delivers fuel to customers in both the drilling and completions markets, and its logistics system is designed to deliver CNG, renewable natural gas, or hydrogen to remote locations. We believe that the added natural gas compression capability is a key enabler of the next step of cost and emissions reductions in the industry.

We believe technical innovation and strong relationships with our customer and supplier bases distinguish us from our competitors and are the foundations of our business. We expect that E&P companies will continue to focus on technological innovation as completion complexity and fracture intensity of horizontal wells increases, particularly as customers are increasingly focused on reducing emissions from their completions operations. We remain proactive in developing innovative solutions to industry challenges, including developing: (i) our databases of U.S. unconventional wells to which we apply our proprietary multi-variable statistical analysis technologies to provide differential insight into fracture design optimization; (ii) our Liberty Quiet Fleet® design which significantly reduces noise levels compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing fleets; (iii) hydraulic fracturing fluid systems tailored to the specific reservoir properties in the basins in which we operate; (iv) our dual fuel dynamic gas blending ("DGB") fleets that allow our engines to run diesel or a combination of diesel and natural gas, to optimize fuel use, reduce emissions and lower costs; (v) our digiFleets ℠ , comprising of digiFrac ℠ and digiPrime ℠ pumps, our innovative, purpose-built electric and hybrid frac pumps that have approximately 25% lower CO2e emission profile than the Tier IV DGB; and (vi) our wet sand handling technology which eliminates the need to dry sand, enabling the deployment of mobile mines nearer to wellsites. In addition, our integrated supply chain includes proppant, chemicals, equipment, natural gas fueling services, logistics and integrated software which we believe promotes wellsite efficiency and leads to more pumping hours and higher productivity throughout the year to better service our customers. In order to achieve our technological objectives, we carefully manage our liquidity and debt position to promote operational flexibility and invest in the business throughout the full commodity cycle in the regions we operate.

## Recent Trends and Outlook

The dynamics of the frac industry are encouraging amidst moderating demand trends, service prices have remained relatively steady while underutilized frac fleets have exited the market. Fleets across the industry were idled in response to a softness in completions activity, supporting a better supply and demand balance of marketed fleets as compared to prior cycles. As the shale revolution matures, the industry has adapted to a new era in frac markets through consolidation, technological progress, disciplined investment, and serving increasingly complex customer needs.

Frac activity has largely stabilized at current levels, representing a baseload of frac fleet demand needed to sustain E&P operators' flattish production levels. We believe fourth quarter trends will likely see seasonal softness, winter weather, and

holiday disruptions. Beginning in 2024, we expect a modest increase in activity due to the recent strengthening of commodity prices.

Global oil and gas markets found firmer footing during the third quarter, driving higher oil and gas prices. Volatility in commodity markets has emerged from the possibility of an escalating conflict in the Middle East and renewed recessionary fears. Recognizing the elevated uncertainty, global oil industry production and demand trends infer that the delicate balance of oil and gas markets is tilted to the upside. The long-term demand outlook for secure North American energy anchors a more durable cycle. OPEC+ decisions, including the extension of Saudi Arabia's production cuts, further demonstrate a willingness to support commodity prices, underpinning long-term investments in North American shale.

During the third quarter of 2023, the posted WTI price traded at an average of $82.25 per barrel ("Bbl"), as compared to the third quarter of 2022 average of $93.06 per Bbl, and second quarter of 2023 average of $73.54 per Bbl. In addition, the average domestic onshore rig count for the United States and Canada was 817 rigs reported in the third quarter of 2023, down from the third quarter of 2022 of 942 but consistent with the second quarter of 2023 of 815, according to a report from Baker Hughes.

## Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, new fleet or new basin start-up costs, fleet lay-down costs, costs of asset acquisitions, gain or loss on the disposal of assets, bad debt reserves, transaction, severance, and other costs, the loss or gain on remeasurement of liability under our tax receivable agreements, the gain or loss on investments, and other non-recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance.

Our board of directors, management, investors, and lenders use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.

## Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

The following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented:

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

## Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility. We expect to fund operations and organic growth with these sources. In addition, we have entered into an additional equipment leasing facility during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to provide us with an additional source of liquidity for our working capital needs. We monitor the availability and cost of capital resources such as equity and debt financings that could be leveraged for current or future financial obligations including those related to acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and other liquidity requirements. We may incur additional indebtedness or issue equity in order to meet our capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements, as well as to fund growth opportunities that we pursue, including via acquisition. Our primary uses of capital have been capital expenditures to support organic growth and funding ongoing operations, including maintenance and fleet upgrades, as well as the repurchases of, and dividends on, shares of our Class A Common Stock.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $17.1 million to $26.6 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $43.7 million as of December 31, 2022, while working capital excluding cash and current liabilities under debt and lease arrangements decreased $0.3 million.

We have $525.0 million committed under the ABL Facility subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory available to finance working capital needs. Based on the September 30, 2023 financials, the borrowing base was calculated to be $521.2 million, and the Company had $223.0 million outstanding, in addition to letters of credit in the amount of $2.6 million, with $295.6 million of remaining availability.

On January 23, 2023, the Company entered into an Eighth Amendment to the ABL Facility (the "Eighth ABL Amendment"). The Eighth ABL Amendment amends certain terms, provisions and covenants of the ABL Facility, including, among other things: (i) increasing the maximum revolver amount from $425.0 million to $525.0 million (the "Upsized Revolver"); (ii) increasing the amount of the accordion feature from $75.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) extending the maturity date from October 22, 2026 to January 23, 2028; (iv) modifying the dollar amounts of various credit facility triggers and tests proportionally to the Upsized Revolver; (v) permitting repayment under the Term Loan Facility prior to February 10, 2023; and (vi) increasing certain indebtedness, intercompany advance, and investment baskets. The Eighth ABL Amendment also includes an agreement from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, to release its second priority liens and security interests on all collateral that served as first priority collateral under the Term Loan Facility. This release was completed during the three months ended June 30, 2023.

Additionally, on January 23, 2023, the Company borrowed $106.7 million on the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to pay off and then terminate the Term Loan Facility. The amount paid includes the balance of the Term Loan Facility upon pay off of $104.7 million, $0.9 million of accrued interest, and a $1.1 million prepayment premium or 1% of the principal. Additionally, there were $0.2 million in bank and legal fees included in the pay off.

The ABL Facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. At September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

See Note 7 -Debt to the unaudited condensed c onsolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.

We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2023, except for purchase commitments under supply agreements as disclosed above under Note 14-Commitments & Contingencies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. As such, we are not materially exposed to any other financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.

## Share Repurchase Program

Under our share repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $250.0 million of outstanding Class A Common Stock through and including July 31, 2024. Additionally, on January 24, 2023 the Board authorized and the Company announced an increase to the share repurchase program that increased the Company's cumulative repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. Shares may be repurchased from time to time for cash in the open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, through derivative transactions or by other means in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The timing and the amount of repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion based on an evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors. The share repurchase program does not require us to purchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our Class A Common Stock and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and expected free cash flow to be generated through the duration of the share repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired shares of Class A Common Stock for $29.3 million and $164.0 million, respectively, under the share repurchase program.

The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report and Note 2Significant Accounting Policies and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," included in the Annual Report). A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

There have been no material changes in our evaluation of our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Our consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, but, effective January 1, 2021, a portion of our operations is conducted in a currency other than U.S. dollars. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary as it is the primary currency within the economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Changes in the exchange rate can affect our revenues, earnings, and the carrying value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, either positively or negatively. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiary's financial statements are reported in other comprehensive loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded foreign currency translation losses of $3.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, to comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded foreign currency translation losses of $6.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively, to comprehensive income.

Other exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2022. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, in addition to foreign currency translation, see Part II, Item 7(a), "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," in the Annual Report.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we integrated accounting functions of the entity acquired in the Siren Acquisition on April 6, 2023. In connection with the integration, we updated documentation of our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to reflect modifications to business processes and accounting procedures impacted.

There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
