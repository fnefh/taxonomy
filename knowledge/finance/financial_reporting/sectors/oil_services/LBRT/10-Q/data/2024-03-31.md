<h2>CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") and certain other communications made by us contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including, among others, expected performance, future operating results, oil and natural gas demand and prices and the outlook for the oil and gas industry, future global economic conditions, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, improvements in operating procedures and technology, our business strategy and the business strategies of our customers, in addition to other estimates, and beliefs. For this purpose, any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward-looking statement. We may use the words "estimate," "outlook," "project," "forecast," "position," "potential," "likely," "believe," "anticipate," "assume," "plan," "expect," "intend," "achievable," "may," "will," "continue," "should," "could" and similar expressions to help identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. Important factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in our most recently filed Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, this Quarterly Report, and other filings that we make with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise and readers should not rely on the forward-looking statements as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events.</p>
<p>All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.</p>

<h2>Note 1-Organization and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Liberty Energy Inc., formerly known as Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (the "Company"), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 21, 2016, to become a holding corporation for Liberty Oilfield Services New HoldCo LLC ("Liberty LLC") and its subsidiaries upon completion of a corporate reorganization (the "Corporate Reorganization") and planned initial public offering of the Company ("IPO"). On April 19, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of changing the Company's name from "Liberty Oilfield Services Inc." to "Liberty Energy Inc." and thereafter, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reflect the new name, effective April 25, 2022.</p>
<p>Effective January 31, 2023, Liberty LLC was merged into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the "Merger"). In connection with the Merger, all outstanding shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock"), were redeemed and exchanged for an equal number of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock"). The Company did not make any distributions or receive any proceeds in connection with this exchange. The Merger did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>The Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading integrated energy services and technology company focused on providing innovative hydraulic fracturing services and related technologies to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production ("E&amp;P") companies in North America. We offer customers hydraulic fracturing services, together with complementary services including wireline services, proppant delivery solutions, field gas processing, compressed natural gas ("CNG") delivery, data analytics, related goods (including our sand mine operations), and technologies to facilitate lower emission completions, thereby helping our customers reduce their emissions profile.</p>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information or notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read together with the annual financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report.</p>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes present the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of operations, cash flows, and equity of the Company as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the entire fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Further, these estimates and other factors, including those outside the Company's control, such as the impact of sustained lower commodity prices, could have a significant adverse impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.</p>
<p>All intercompany amounts have been eliminated in the presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Company's operations are organized into a single reportable segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing and related goods and services.</p>
<h2>Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures</p>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires more detailed disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, related to the Company's reportable segment. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Although the Company has only one reportable segment, the Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.</p>

<h2>Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires disaggregation of certain components included in the Company's effective tax rate and income taxes paid disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements but does not expect it will have a material impact.</p>
<h2>Siren Acquisition</h2>
<p>On April 6, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a Permian focused integrated natural gas compression and compressed natural gas delivery business, Siren Energy &amp; Logistics, LLC, for cash consideration of $75.7 million, after post-closing adjustments and net of cash received, (the "Siren Acquisition"). The Siren Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the Company conducted assessments of the net assets acquired and recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. In connection with the Siren Acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $42.0 million, property and equipment of $34.9 million, net working capital of $2.5 million, deferred revenue of $5.2 million, and other assets of $1.8 million. Goodwill is recorded in other assets and deferred revenue is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Due to the immateriality of the Siren Acquisition, the related revenue and earnings, supplemental pro forma financial information, and detailed purchase price allocation are not disclosed.</p>
<h2>Reclassifications</h2>
<p>Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period financial statement presentation. The Company combined amounts previously presented within "Effect of exchange on deferred tax asset, net of liability under tax receivable agreements" and "Deferred tax impact of ownership changes from issuance of Class A Common Stock" into "Deferred tax and tax receivable agreements impact of the Liberty LLC merger into the Company" in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity.</p>
<p>In the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified from "Amortization of debt issuance costs" and "Non-cash lease expense" into "Other non-cash items, net". Additionally, amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified from "Deferred revenue" into "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities".</p>
<p>These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net income or loss.</p>

<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company didnot record any write-downs to inventory carrying values. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis resulted in the Company recording a write-down to the inventory carrying value of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>

<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized depreciation expense of$110 .9 million and $88.4 million, respectively. Depletion expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that no triggering events that could indicate possible impairment of property and equipment had occurred, other than related to the assets held for sale discussed below.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company classified $1.2 million of land and $2.8 million of buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, of two properties that it intends to sell within the next year, and that meet the held for sale criteria, as assets held for sale, included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company estimates that the carrying value of the assets is less than the fair value less the estimated costs to sell, net of writedowns taken in the prior period, and therefore no gain or loss was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, the Company classified $0.7 million of land and $0.8 million of buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, of one property that it intends to sell within one year, and that meet the held for sale criteria, as assets held for sale, included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2023, the Company classified $1.1 million of land and $6.2 million of buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, of two properties as assets held for sale. The Company estimated that carrying value of the assets was equal to the fair value less the estimated costs to sell, net of write-downs taken in the prior period, and therefore no gain or loss was recorded.</p>
<h2>Note 5-Leases</h2>
<p>The Company has operating and finance leases primarily for vehicles, equipment, railcars, office space, and facilities. The terms and conditions for these leases vary by the type of underlying asset.</p>
<p>Certain leases include variable lease payments for items such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Payments that vary based on an index or rate are included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities at the rate as of the commencement date. All other variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of lease assets and liabilities, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.</p>

<p>The Company's vehicle leases typically include a residual value guarantee. For the Company's vehicle leases classified as operating leases, the total residual value guaranteed as of March 31, 2024 is $14.8 million; the payment is not probable and therefore has not been included in the measurement of the lease liability and right-ofuse asset. For vehicle leases that are classified as finance leases, the Company includes the residual value guarantee, estimated in the lease agreement, in the financing lease liability.</p>

<h2>Lessor Arrangements</h2>
<p>The Company leases dry and wet sand containers and conveyor belts to customers through operating leases, where the lessor for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. The lease agreements do not include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value. However, some of the leases contain a termination clause in which the customer can cancel the contract. The leases can be subject to variable lease payments if the customer requests more units than what is agreed upon in the lease. The Company does not record any lease assets or liabilities related to these variable items.</p>

<p>On January 23, 2023, the Company borrowed $106.7 million on the ABL Facility and used the proceeds to pay off and terminate the Term Loan Facility. The amount paid included the balance of the Term Loan Facility at pay off of $104.7 million, $0.9 million of accrued interest, and a $1.1 million prepayment premium.</p>

<p>The weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was7.5% and 7.6%, respectively.</p>
<h2>ABL Facility</h2>
<p>Under the terms of the ABL Facility, up to $525.0 million may be borrowed, subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. As of March 31, 2024, the borrowing base was calculated to be $465.1 million, and the Company had $166.0 million outstanding in addition to letters of credit in the amount of $7.4 million, with $291.7 million of remaining availability. Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a base rate, plus an applicable SOFR margin of 1.5% to 2.0% or base rate margin of 0.5% to 1.0%, as described in the ABL Facility credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). Additionally, borrowings as of March 31, 2024 incurred interest at a weighted average rate of 7.5%. The average monthly unused commitment is subject to an unused commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375%. Interest and fees are payable in arrears at the end of each month, or, in the case of SOFR loans, at the end of each interest period. The ABL Facility matures on January 23, 2028. Borrowings under the ABL Facility are collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory, and further secured by the Company as parent guarantor.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility includes certain non-financial covenants, including but not limited to restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions. Moreover, the ability of the Company to incur additional debt and to make distributions is dependent on maintaining a maximum leverage ratio.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility is not subject to financial covenants unless liquidity, as defined in the Credit Agreement, drops below a specific level. The Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 1.0 to 1.0 for each period if excess availability is less than10% of the borrowing base or $52.5 million, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2024.</p>

<h2>Note 8-Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities represent the amounts that would be received to sell those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction on the reporting date. These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability on the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company discloses the fair values of its assets and liabilities according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.</li>
<li>· Level 2 Inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.</li>
<li>· Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborating market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities that are initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborating market data is no longer available. Transfers occur at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.</p>
<p>The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and finance and operating lease obligations. These financial instruments do not</p>

<p>require disclosure by level. The carrying values of all of the Company's financial instruments included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets approximated or equaled their fair values on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li>· The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable (including accrued liabilities) approximated fair value on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to their short-term nature.</li>
<li>· The carrying value of amounts outstanding under long-term debt agreements with variable rates approximated fair value on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as the effective interest rates approximated market rates.</li>
<li>· The carrying values of amounts outstanding under finance and operating lease obligations approximated fair value on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as the effective borrowing rates approximated market rates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nonrecurring Measurements</h2>
<p>Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but may be subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company recorded $1.2 million of land and $2.8 million of buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, of two properties that met the held for sale criteria, to assets held for sale at a total fair value of $3.4 million, which are included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimated the fair value of the properties based on the listed selling price for the two properties, which is a Level 3 input. The Company estimates that the carrying value of the assets is less than the fair value less the estimated costs to sell, net of write-downs taken in the prior period, and therefore no gain or loss was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $0.7 million of land and $0.8 million of buildings, net of accumulated depreciation, of one property that met the held for sale criteria, to assets held for sale at a total fair value of $0.8 million, which are included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimated the fair value of the property based on a communicated selling price for one property, which is a Level 3 input.</p>
<h2>Recurring Measurements</h2>
<p>The fair values of the Company's cash equivalents measured on a recurring basis pursuant to ASC 820-10 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures are carried at estimated fair value. Cash equivalents consist of money market accounts which the Company has classified as Level 1 given the active market for these accounts. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash equivalents, measured at fair value, of $0.3 million.</p>
<h2>Nonfinancial assets</h2>
<p>The Company estimates fair value to perform impairment tests as required on long-lived assets. The inputs used to determine such fair value are primarily based upon internally developed cash flow models and would generally be classified within Level 3 in the event that such assets were required to be measured and recorded at fair value within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. No such measurements were required as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as no triggering event was identified.</p>
<h2>Credit Risk</h2>
<p>The Company's financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and trade receivables.</p>
<p>The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances on deposit with financial institutions total$23. 8 million and $36.8 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which exceeded FDIC insured limits. The Company regularly monitors these institutions' financial condition.</p>
<p>The majority of the Company's customers have payment terms of 45 days or less.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, customer A accounted for15% of total accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. As of December 31, 2023, no customers accounted for 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, customer A accounted for 15% of consolidated revenues. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, customer B accounted for 12% of consolidated revenues. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues during the respective periods.</p>

<p>The Company mitigates the associated credit risk by performing credit evaluations and monitoring the payment patterns of its customers.</p>
<p>The Company applies historic loss factors to its receivable portfolio segments that are not expected to be further impacted by current economic developments, and an additional economic conditions factor to portfolio segments anticipated to experience greater losses in the current economic environment. While the Company has not experienced significant credit losses in the past and has not seen material changes to the payment patterns of its customers, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the degree to which unforeseen events may affect the ability of its customers to timely pay receivables when due. Accordingly, in future periods, the Company may revise its estimates of expected credit losses.</p>
<p>As of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had$0 .9 million in allowance for credit losses as follows:</p>

<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>On July 25, 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized and the Company announced a share repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to $250.0 million of the Company's Class A Common Stock beginning immediately and continuing through July 31, 2024. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the Board authorized and the Company announced an increase of the cumulative repurchase authorization to $500.0 million. Furthermore, on January 23, 2024, the Board authorized and the Company announced an increase of the cumulative repurchase authorization to $750.0 million and extended the authorization through July 31, 2026. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management's assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company's Class A Common Stock, the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company's debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

<p>As of March 31, 2024, $391.8 million remained authorized for future repurchases of Class A Common Stock under the share repurchase program.</p>
<p>The Company accounts for the purchase price of repurchased common shares in excess of par value ($0.01 per share of Class A Common Stock) as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, and will continue to do so until additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero. Thereafter, any excess purchase price will be recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.</p>
<p>As enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Company accrued stock repurchase excise tax of $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

<h2>Note 11-Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company is a corporation and is subject to taxation in the United States, Canada, Australia and various state, local and provincial jurisdictions. Historically, Liberty LLC was treated as a partnership, and its income was passed through to its owners for income tax purposes. Liberty LLC's members, including the Company, were liable for federal, state and local income taxes based on their share of Liberty LLC's pass-through taxable income.</p>
<p>Effective January 31, 2023, the Company adopted a plan of merger, pursuant to which Liberty LLC merged into the Company, ceasing the existence of Liberty LLC with the Company remaining as the surviving entity. Liberty LLC filed a final tax return during the 2023 calendar year. The Company is still party to the TRAs; the associated liabilities are discussed below.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") released a statement on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges of the digital economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15% global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations (the "Pillar Two Framework"). The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected by 2024. The Company is continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two Framework and its potential impact on future periods, including any legislation enacted in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.</p>
<p>The Company may distribute cash from foreign subsidiaries to its U.S. parent as business needs arise. The Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are</p>

<h2>Tax Receivable Agreements</h2>
<p>In connection with the IPO, on January 17, 2018, the Company entered intotwo Tax Receivable Agreements (the "TRAs") with R/C Energy IV Direct Partnership, L.P. and the then existing owners that continued to own units in Liberty LLC ("Liberty LLC Units") (each such person and any permitted transferee, a "TRA Holder" and together, the "TRA Holders"). The TRAs generally provide for the payment by the Company of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) that the Company actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result, as applicable to each TRA Holder, of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of the Company's acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such TRA Holder's Liberty LLC Units in connection with the IPO or pursuant to the exercise of redemption or call rights, (ii) any net operating losses available to the Company as a result of the Corporate Reorganization, and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments the Company makes under the TRAs.</p>

<h2>Item 2. Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<p>The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described in "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," the Annual Report under the heading "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and in "Part II - Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors" included herein. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading integrated energy services and technology company focused on providing innovative hydraulic fracturing services and related technologies to onshore oil and natural gas E&amp;P companies in North America. We offer customers hydraulic fracturing services, together with complementary services including wireline services, proppant delivery solutions, field gas processing and treating, CNG delivery, data analytics, related goods (including our sand mine operations), and technologies to facilitate lower emission completions, thereby helping our customers reduce their emissions profile. We have grown from one active hydraulic fracturing fleet in December 2011 to over 40 active fleets as of March 31, 2024. We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, the Williston Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale, the Appalachian Basin (Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale), the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, the DJ Basin, and the Anadarko Basin. Our operations also extend to a few smaller shale basins, including the Uinta Basin, the Powder River Basin, and the San Juan Basin, as well as to two sand mines in the Permian Basin.</p>
<p>In early 2023, the Company launched Liberty Power Innovations LLC ("LPI"), an integrated alternative fuel and power solutions provider for remote applications. LPI provides CNG supply, field gas processing and treating, and well site fueling and logistics. LPI was formed with the initial focus on supporting the Company's transition towards our next generation digiFleets ℠ and dual fuel fleets, as CNG fueling services are limited in the market, yet critical to maintaining highly efficient well site operations. Currently, LPI is primarily focused on supporting an industry transition to natural gas fueled technologies, serving as a key enabler of the next step of cost and emissions reductions in the oilfield.</p>
<p>We believe technical innovation and strong relationships with our customer and supplier bases distinguish us from our competitors and are the foundations of our business. We expect that E&amp;P companies will continue to focus on technological innovation as completion complexity and fracture intensity of horizontal wells increases, particularly as customers are increasingly focused on reducing emissions from their completions operations. We remain proactive in developing innovative solutions to industry challenges, including developing: (i) our databases of U.S. unconventional wells to which we apply our proprietary multi-variable statistical analysis technologies to provide differential insight into fracture design optimization; (ii) our Liberty Quiet Fleet® design which significantly reduces noise levels compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing fleets; (iii) hydraulic fracturing fluid systems tailored to the specific reservoir properties in the basins in which we operate; (iv) our dual fuel dynamic gas blending ("DGB") fleets that allow our engines to run diesel or a combination of diesel and natural gas, to optimize fuel use, reduce emissions and lower costs; (v) our digiFleets ℠ , comprising of digiFrac ℠ and digiPrime ℠ pumps, our innovative, purpose-built electric and hybrid frac pumps that have approximately 25% lower CO2e emission profile than the Tier IV DGB; (vi) our wet sand handling technology which eliminates the need to dry sand, enabling the deployment of mobile mines nearer to wellsites; and (vii) the launch of LPI to support the transition to our digiFleets as well as the transition to lower costs and emissions in the oilfield. In addition, our integrated supply chain includes proppant, chemicals, equipment, natural gas fueling services, logistics and integrated software which we believe promotes wellsite efficiency and leads to more pumping hours and higher productivity throughout the year to better service our customers. In order to achieve our technological objectives, we carefully manage our liquidity and debt position to promote operational flexibility and invest in the business throughout the full commodity cycle in the regions we operate.</p>
<h2>Recent Trends and Outlook</h2>
<p>Frac industry dynamics remain constructive, as relatively steady demand in recent months has focused service companies on disciplined pricing and quality of service. Global oil and gas commodity prices have diverged and moved materially in recent months. Yet these changes have not materially impacted demand for North American frac services. Oil prices rallied since early in the year, owing to an improved global economic outlook, ongoing OPEC+ voluntary production cuts, and rising geopolitical tensions. Natural gas prices have conversely declined considerably since last fall, primarily owing to strong production and mild winter weather driving high natural gas inventories. Natural gas price pressures are expected to strengthen int he future with increasing LNG exports and surging domestic power demand in years ahead. Global energy demand continues to march higher, supporting what we believe will be a strong North American oil and gas industry in the coming years.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 2024, the posted WTI price traded at an average of $77.50 per barrel ("Bbl"), as compared to the first quarter of 2023 average of $75.93 per Bbl, and the fourth quarter of 2023 average of $78.53 per Bbl. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the WTI price traded at an average of $86.41 per Bbl through April 15, 2024. In addition, the average domestic onshore rig count for the United States and Canada was 810 rigs reported in the first quarter of 2024, down from the first quarter of 2023 of 965, but up from the fourth quarter of 2023 of 781, according to a report from Baker Hughes.</p>

<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>Our revenue decreased $189.0 million, or 15.0% , to $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to an activity-driven decrease in fleet utilization commensurate with lower demand for hydraulic fracturing services, a decrease in materials pricing, and slightly lower service prices.</p>
<h2>Cost of Services</h2>
<p>Cost of services (excluding depreciation, depletion, and amortization) decreased $10 5.7 million , or 11.9% , to $782.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $888.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in expense was primarily related to decreases in materials and lower fleet utilization during the period ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>General and Administrative</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses was consistent with the prior year quarter,d ecreasing 0.1% , to $53.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $53.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily related to lower performance related compensation expense offset by higher corporate technology and other costs.</p>
<h2>Transaction, Severance, and Other Costs</h2>
<p>Transaction, severance, and other costs decreased $0 .6 million to $0.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The costs incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2023 consisted of due diligence work for the Siren Acquisition. See Note 2Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.</p>
<h2>Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization</h2>
<p>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased $28.8 million, or 30. 5%, to $123.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $94.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in 2024 was due to additional equipment placed in service since the prior year quarter, including equipment related to the deployment of our digiTechnologies . SM</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>(Gain) Loss on Disposal of Assets, net</h2>
<p>The Company recorded a gain on disposal of assets of $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a loss on disposal of assets of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The gain as of March 31, 2024 was primarily related to the scrapping of fully depreciated equipment. The loss as of March 31, 2023 was a result of the Company regularly selling equipment that is no longer in use as part of normal course fleet and equipment management.</p>
<h2>Other Expense, Net</h2>
<p>Other expense, net decreased by $0.8 million, or 10.5%, to $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $7.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Other expense, net is comprised of interest income-related party and interest expense, net. Interest income-related party increased $0.1 million related to a note receivable agreement executed in December 2022, amended in August 2023, and fully collected in March 2024. Additionally, interest expense, net decreased $0.7 million as a result of decreased average borrowings partially offset by higher interest rates under the credit facility during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Expense</h2>
<p>The Company recognized income tax expense of $26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an effective rate of 24.4%, compared to $54.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an effective rate of 25.1%. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in net income before income taxes, as discussed above.</p>
<h2>Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, new fleet or new basin start-up costs, fleet lay-down costs, costs of asset acquisitions, gain or loss on the disposal of assets, bad debt reserves, transaction, severance, and other costs, the gain or loss on remeasurement of liability under our tax receivable agreements, the gain or loss on investments, and other non-recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance.</p>
<p>Our board of directors, management, investors, and lenders use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.</p>
<h2>Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.</p>
<p>The following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented:</p>

<p>EBITDA was $238.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $319.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $244.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to $329.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decreases in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA primarily resulted from modestly lower pricing and decreased activity levels as described above under the captions Revenue , Cost of Services , and General and Administrative for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 , Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 .</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility. We expect to fund operations and organic growth with these sources. We monitor the availability and cost of capital resources such as equity, debt, and lease financings that could be leveraged for current or future financial obligations including those related to acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and other liquidity requirements. We may incur additional indebtedness or issue equity in order to meet our capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements, as well as to fund growth opportunities that we pursue, including via acquisition. Our primary uses of capital have been capital expenditures to support organic growth and funding ongoing operations, including maintenance and fleet upgrades, as well as the repurchases of, and dividends on, shares of our Class A Common Stock.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.0 million to $23.8 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $36.8 million as of December 31, 2023, while working capital excluding cash and current liabilities under debt and lease arrangements increased $20.4 million.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company had one credit agreement outstanding, a revolving line of credit up to $525.0 million (the "ABL Facility"). The ABL Facility is subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory available to finance working capital needs. As of March 31, 2024, the borrowing base was calculated to be $465.1 million, and the Company had $166.0 million outstanding, in addition to a letter of credit in the amount of $7.4 million, with $291.7 million of remaining availability.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. As of March 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.</p>
<p>See Note 7 - Debt to the unaudited condensed c onsolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.</p>
<p>We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024, except for purchase commitments under supply agreements as disclosed above under Note 14-Commitments &amp; Contingencies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. As such, we are not materially exposed to any other financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>Under our share repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $750.0 million of outstanding Class A Common Stock through July 31, 2026. Shares may be repurchased from time to time for cash in the open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, through derivative transactions or by other means in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The timing and the amount of repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion based on an evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors. The share repurchase program does not require us to purchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our Class A Common Stock and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund any repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and expected free cash flow to be generated through the duration of the share repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired shares of Class A Common Stock for $30.2 million, under the share repurchase program.</p>

<h2>Analysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023</h2>
<p>Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $203.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $44.5 million decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a $189.0 million decrease in revenues, offset by a $133.7 million decrease in cash operating expenses, interest expense, net, and income tax, and a $52.0 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a $62.7 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was $142.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $129.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cash used in investing activities was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 as the Company continued to invest in equipment, including the new digiTechnologies™ suite, to support increased customer demand in next generation equipment and technology.</p>
<p>Financing Activities . Net cash used in financing activities was $30.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $97.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The $66.9 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a $35.7 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings and $44.5 million less cash used for share repurchases for the three months ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in cash paid for finance leases and a $5.2 million increase in cash used for payments pursuant to tax receivable agreements.</p>
<h2>Cash Requirements</h2>
<p>Our material cash commitments consist primarily of obligations under long-term debt on the ABL Facility, TRAs, finance and operating leases for property and equipment, cash used to pay for repurchases of, and dividends on, shares of our Class A Common Stock, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2024 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including pricing, volumes, and duration. We have no material off balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2024, except for purchase commitments of $84.5 million payable within 2024 and $13.0 million payable thereafter. See N ote 14 -Commitments &amp; Contingencies t o the unaudited condensed c onsolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for information regarding scheduled contractual obligations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company expanded its equipment lease facility with two lessors resulting in an increase in finance lease obligations of $30.1 million. The term on these new leases range from three to five years.</p>
<p>There have been no material changes to cash requirements since the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company is a corporation and is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income tax. The Company is also subject to Canada and Australia federal and provincial income tax on its foreign operations.</p>
<p>The effective global income tax rate applicable to the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was24.4 %, compared to 25.1% for the period ended March 31, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% due to the Company's Canadian operations, state income taxes in the states the Company operates, as well as nondeductible executive compensation. The Company recognized an income tax expense of $26.5 million an d $54.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of March 31, 2024, the Company's net deferred tax liabilities were $102.3 million. The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024</p>
<p>Refer to Note 11-Income Taxes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information related to income tax expense.</p>
<h2>Tax Receivable Agreements</h2>
<p>Refer to Note 11-Income Taxes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information related to tax receivable agreements.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," included in the Annual Report). A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.</p>
<p>There have been no material changes in our evaluation of our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk</h2>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, but, effective January 1, 2021, a portion of our operations is conducted in a currency other than U.S. dollars. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiary as it is the primary currency within the economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Changes in the exchange rate can affect our revenues, earnings, and the carrying value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, either positively or negatively. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiary's financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income (loss). For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded foreign currency translation loss of $3.7 million and $0.5 million, to comprehensive income (loss), respectively.</p>
<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company formed an entity in Australia, and will use the Australian dollar as the functional currency for the new entity's operations. The Australian entity does not have any assets or material liabilities as of March 31, 2024, did not generate any revenue, and incurred only de minimis expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as such there in no impact of changes in the Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate in the financial statements of Company as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Other exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, in addition to foreign currency translation, see Part II, Item 7(a), "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," in the Annual Report.</p>
