NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
------------------------------------------

(Unaudited)

1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
----------------------------------------------------

Description of Business
-----------------------

Bath & Body Works, Inc. (the "Company") is a global omnichannel retailer focused on personal care and home fragrance. The Company sells merchandise through its retail stores in the United States of America ("U.S.") and Canada, and through its websites and other channels, under the Bath & Body Works, White Barn and other brand names. The Company's international business is conducted through franchise, license and wholesale partners. The Company operates as and reports a single segment.

Fiscal Year
-----------

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, "third quarter of 2023" and "third quarter of 2022" refer to the thirteen-week periods ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. "Year-to-date 2023" and "year-to-date 2022" refer to the thirty-nine-week periods ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.

The Company utilizes the retail calendar for reporting. As a result, the Company's fiscal 2023 will include 53 weeks, with the fourth quarter representing the 14-week period ending February 3, 2024.

Basis of Consolidation
----------------------

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method.

Interim Financial Statements
----------------------------

The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the periods ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 are unaudited and are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods.

Seasonality of Business
-----------------------

The Company's operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). Historically, the Company's sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Due to the seasonal variations in the retail industry, the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.

Derivative Financial Instruments
--------------------------------

The Company's Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the Company's merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure. Amounts are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All designated cash flow hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant for any period presented. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Concentration of Credit Risk
----------------------------

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company's investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.

The Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company determines the required

allowance for expected credit losses using information such as customer credit history and financial condition. Amounts are recorded to the allowance when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur.

Easton Investments
------------------

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a planned community in Columbus, Ohio, that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, totaling $127 million as of October 28, 2023, $124 million as of January 28, 2023 and $125 million as of October 29, 2022, are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in the Company's Easton investments are equity interests in Easton Town Center, LLC ("ETC") and Easton Gateway, LLC ("EG"), entities that own and develop commercial entertainment and shopping centers. The Company's investments in ETC and EG are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has majority financial interests in ETC and EG, but another unaffiliated member manages them, and certain significant decisions regarding ETC and EG require the consent of unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.

Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee's net income or loss. Losses are only recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below zero if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company's share of net income or loss of all unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company's equity method investments are required to be reviewed for impairment when it is determined there may be an other-than-temporary loss in value.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
-----------------------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
-----------------------------------------

The Company did not adopt any new accounting standards year-to-date 2023 that had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, as of December 1, 2023, there were no new accounting standards that the Company has not yet adopted that are expected to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

2. Revenue Recognition
----------------------

Accounts receivable, net from revenue-generating activities were $84 million as of October 28, 2023, $79 million as of January 28, 2023 and $103 million as of October 29, 2022. These accounts receivable primarily relate to amounts due from the Company's franchise, license and wholesale partners. Under these arrangements, payment terms are typically 45 to 75 days.

The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of transfer of control of goods or services. Deferred revenue primarily relates to gift cards, loyalty points and rewards and direct channel shipments, which are all impacted by seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Deferred revenue, which is recorded within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $163 million as of October 28, 2023, $195 million as of January 28, 2023 and $147 million as of October 29, 2022. The Company recognized $123 million as revenue year-to-date 2023 from amounts recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year.

The following table provides a disaggregation of Net Sales for the third quarters of and year-to-date 2023 and 2022:

Table of Contents

|  | Third Quarter | Third Quarter | Year-to-Date | Year-to-Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
|  | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Stores - U.S. and Canada | $ 1,168 | $ 1,178 | $ 3,345 | $ 3,398 |

| Total Net Sales | $ 1,562 | $ 1,604 | $ 4,517 | $ 4,672 |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Company's net sales outside of the U.S. include sales from Company-operated stores and its e-commerce site in Canada, royalties associated with franchised stores and wholesale sales. Certain of these sales are subject to the impact of fluctuations in

foreign currency. The Company's net sales outside of the U.S. totaled $161 million and $160 million for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $468 million and $462 million for year-to-date 2023 and 2022, respectively.

3. Net Income Per Share and Shareholders' Equity (Deficit)
----------------------------------------------------------

Net Income Per Share

Net Income per Basic Share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net Income per Diluted Share includes the weightedaverage effect of dilutive restricted share units, performance share units and stock options (collectively, "Dilutive Awards") on the weighted-average common shares outstanding.

The following table provides the weighted-average shares utilized for the calculation of Net Income per Basic and Diluted Share for the third quarters of and year-to-date 2023 and 2022:

Asset-backed Revolving Credit Facility
--------------------------------------

The Company and certain of the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure an asset-backed revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility"). The ABL Facility, which allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, has aggregate commitments of $750 million and an expiration date in August 2026.

In the second quarter of 2023, the Company amended its ABL Facility to replace the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") based rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") based rate as the interest rate benchmark on U.S. dollar borrowings. This amendment made no other material changes to the terms of the ABL Facility.

Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on the Company's eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, the Company is required to repay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of October 28, 2023, the Company's borrowing base was $1.169 billion, and it had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility supports the Company's letter of credit program. The Company had $10 million of outstanding letters of credit as of October 28, 2023 that reduced its availability under the ABL Facility. As of October 28, 2023, the Company's availability under the ABL Facility was $740 million.

As of October 28, 2023, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.25% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the Term SOFR plus1.25% and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings was the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 1.25% per annum.

The ABL Facility requires the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $70 million or (ii) 10% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of October 28, 2023, the Company was not required to maintain this ratio.

8. Fair Value Measurements
--------------------------

Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. The Company's Cash and Cash Equivalents are considered Level 1 fair value measurements as they are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding Long-term Debt as of October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022:

Table of Contents

|  | October 28, 2023 | January 28, 2023 | October 29, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Principal Value | $ 4,542 | $ 4,915 | 4,915 |
| Fair Value, Estimated (a) | 4,122 | 4,707 | 4,367 |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Management believes that the carrying values of the Company's Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses approximate their fair values because of their short maturities.

9. Commitments and Contingencies
--------------------------------

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against the Company may from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, tax, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Lease Guarantees
----------------

In connection with the spin-off of Victoria's Secret & Co. and the disposal of a certain other business, the Company had remaining contingent obligations of $267 million as of October 28, 2023 related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases, primarily related to office space, expiring at various dates through 2037. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of these businesses. The Company's reserves related to these obligations were not significant for any period presented.

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
-------------------------------------------------

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bath & Body Works, Inc. (the Company) as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and total equity (deficit) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the thirty-nine week periods ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated interim financial statements"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 28, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 17, 2023, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
------------------------

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Executive Overview
------------------

In the third quarter of 2023, Net Sales decreased $42 million, or 3%, to $1.562 billion compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in both average dollar sale and total transactions. In our stores and direct channels, Net Sales decreased 1% to $1.168 billion, and 8% to $317 million, respectively. In our international business, Net Sales decreased 5% to $77 million.

In the third quarter of 2023, Operating Income increased $19 million, or 9%, to $221 million, from $202 million in the third quarter of 2022, and the Operating Income rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 14.1% from 12.6%. These increases were primarily due to a 200-basis point increase in our merchandise margin rate, driven by approximately $40 million of deflation in our cost structure, lower product costs and reduced transportation costs, and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expense and rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) improvement resulting from our cost optimization work (discussed below).

For additional information related to our third quarter 2023 financial performance, see "Results of Operations."

Cost Optimization
-----------------

We are enhancing our operations and efficiency by targeting an aggregate of $200 million of planned annual cost savings across both Gross Profit and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses. Our cost optimization work delivered benefits of approximately $45 million in the third quarter of 2023, and we expect to deliver approximately $50 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $150 million of total cost savings in fiscal 2023. We expect to realize the remaining benefits in fiscal 2024.

Outlook
-------

We anticipate continued macroeconomic uncertainty, soft customer spending and category normalization following the COVID-19 pandemic in our candles and sanitizers categories to pressure Net Sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and potentially continuing into fiscal 2024. We expect our merchandise margin rate to improve in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by anticipated deflation in our cost structure and expected reductions in expenses resulting from our cost optimization work, partially offset by our continued investment in product formulation and packaging upgrades. General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses are expected to deleverage in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, as we expect higher marketing spend and technology investments. We are investing in a brand campaign and personalized marketing to activate new programs to drive customer awareness, acquisition and retention. Following the information technology ("IT") separation from Victoria's Secret that we substantially completed in the second quarter of 2023,

we expect technology investments to remain elevated to drive future growth. We anticipate continued cost deflation and the benefits of our cost optimization work to support our operating income rate in fiscal 2024.

Adjusted Financial Information
------------------------------

In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present Net Income and Net Income Per Diluted Share for the third quarter of and year-to-date 2023 on an adjusted basis, to remove certain special items recorded in 2023. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our operations due to their size and nature. We did not make any adjustments to our results in the third quarter of or year-to-date 2022. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These nonGAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definitions of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The table below reconciles the third quarter of and year-to-date 2023 GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures:

Net Sales
---------

The following table provides Net Sales for the third quarter of 2023 in comparison to the third quarter of 2022:

|  | 2023 | 2022 | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (in millions) | (in millions) |  |
| Stores - U.S. and Canada | $ 1,168 | $ 1,178 | (1 %) |
| Direct - U.S. and Canada | 317 | 345 | (8 %) |
| International (a) | 77 | 81 | (5 %) |
| Total Net Sales | $ 1,562 | $ 1,604 | (3 %) |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The following table provides a reconciliation of Net Sales for the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2022:

|  | (in millions) |
| --- | --- |
| 2022 Net Sales | $ 1,604 |
| Comparable Store Sales | (68) |
| Sales Associated with New, Closed and Non-comparable Remodeled Stores, Net | 59 |
| Direct Channels | (28) |
| International Wholesale, Royalty and Other | (4) |
| Foreign Currency Translation | (1) |
| 2023 Net Sales | $ 1,562 |

For the third quarter of 2023, Net Sales decreased $42 million, to $1.562 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2022. Net Sales decreased in the stores channel by $10 million, or 1%, due to a decline in average dollar sale, partially offset by Net Sales from new store growth. Direct Net Sales decreased $28 million, or 8%, due to a decline in orders, which was partially due to our customers continuing to select our buy online-pick up in store ("BOPIS") option (which is recognized as store Net Sales) as we completed our rollout of BOPIS capabilities to our U.S. stores in the first quarter of 2023. International Net Sales decreased $4 million, or 5%, due to lower orders and shipments, partially offset by new stores opened by our partners.

In terms of category performance, Net Sales in candles and sanitizers both declined compared to the third quarter of 2022 driven by category normalization following the COVID-19 pandemic. Both soaps and wallflowers increased compared to the third quarter of 2022. Body care was approximately flat compared to the third quarter of 2022, as growth in our men's business and fine fragrance mist was offset by declines in wellness and travel.

Gross Profit
------------

For the third quarter of 2023, our Gross Profit increased $4 million to $682 million, and our Gross Profit rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 43.6% from 42.2%. Gross Profit increased due to a 200-basis point increase in our merchandise margin rate driven by approximately $40 million of deflation in our cost structure, lower product costs and reduced transportation costs, partially offset by our continued investment in product formulations and packaging innovation. The improvement in merchandise margin was partially offset by increased Buying and Occupancy Expense primarily due to new store growth.

The Gross Profit rate increase was driven by the increase in the merchandise margin rate due to the factors discussed above, partially offset by the Buying and Occupancy Expense deleverage due to lower Net Sales and increased occupancy expenses.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses
----------------------------------------------------

The following table provides detail for our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022:

Table of Contents

|  | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 | 2022 | Change | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (in millions) | % of Net Sales | (in millions) | % of Net Sales | (in millions) | % of Net Sales |
| Selling Expenses | $ 283 | 18.1 % | $ 300 | 18.7 % | $ (17) | (0.6 %) |
| Home Office and Marketing Expenses | 178 | 11.4 % | 176 | 11.0 % | 2 | 0.4 % |
| Total | $ 461 | 29.5 % | $ 476 | 29.7 % | $ (15) | (0.2 %) |

For the third quarter of 2023, our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses decreased $15 million to $461 million, and the rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 29.5% from 29.7%. Our Selling Expenses decreased primarily due to our cost optimization work related to efficiency in store labor and selling productivity, reduced expense as we optimized our call center and the decline in Net Sales. Our Home Office Expenses increased primarily due to higher technology expense, principally related to IT separation costs as well as strategic investments to drive future growth, partially offset by severance and related charges of approximately $6 million recognized in the third quarter of 2022.

The General, Administrative and Store Operating Expense rate decreased primarily due to the benefits of our cost optimization work related to Selling Expenses, partially offset by our investments in technology as well as deleverage on lower Net Sales.

Other Income and Expenses
-------------------------

Interest Expense
----------------

The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022:

|  | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average daily borrowings (in millions) | 4,658 | 4,915 |
| Average borrowing rate | 7.4 % | 7.1 % |

For the third quarter of 2023, our Interest Expense was $84 million, compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2022. Our lower average daily borrowings, which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes, were partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.

Other Income
------------

For the third quarter of 2023, our Other Income was $22 million, primarily due to pre-tax gains of $12 million associated with the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes and interest income on cash balances.

Provision for Income Taxes
--------------------------

For the third quarter of 2023, our effective tax rate was 25.3% compared to 23.3% in the third quarter of 2022. The 2023 third quarter rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates. The 2022 third qua rter rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters during the quarter.

| 2022 Net Sales | $ 4,672 |
| Comparable Store Sales | (188) |
| Sales Associated with New, Closed and Non-comparable Remodeled Stores, Net | 143 |
| Direct Channels | (104) |
| International Wholesale, Royalty and Other | 2 |
| Foreign Currency Translation | (8) |
| 2023 Net Sales | $ 4,517 |

For year-to-date 2023, Net Sales decreased $155 million, to $4.517 billion, compared to year-to-date 2022. Net Sales decreased in the stores channel by $53 million, or 2%, due to a decline in average dollar sale, partially offset by Net Sales from new store growth. Direct Net Sales decreased $104 million, or 10%, due to a decline in orders, which was partially due to our customers continuing to select our BOPIS option (which is recognized as store Net Sales) as we completed our rollout of BOPIS capabilities to our U.S. stores in the first quarter of 2023. International Net Sales increased by $2 million, or 1%, primarily due to new stores opened by our partners.

In terms of category performance, Net Sales in candles, sanitizers and soaps declined compared to year-to-date 2022 driven by category normalization following the COVID-19 pandemic. Though total body care Net Sales decreased slightly compared to year-to-date 2022, Net Sales in our men's business increased during the period.

Gross Profit
------------

For year-to-date 2023, our Gross Profit decreased $107 million to $1.899 billion, and our Gross Profit rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 42.0% from 42.9%. Gross Profit decreased due to the decline in Net Sales and an increase in occupancy expenses primarily associated with store growth. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our merchandise margin rate driven by deflation in our cost structure, lower product costs, reduced transportation costs and slightly increased average unit retails, partially offset by our continued investment in product formulations and packaging innovation.

The Gross Profit rate decline was driven by increased occupancy expenses and Buying and Occupancy Expense deleverage due to lower Net Sales, partially offset by the increase in the merchandise margin rate due to the factors discussed above.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses
----------------------------------------------------

The following table provides detail for our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses for year-to-date 2023 compared to year-to-date 2022:

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

For year-to-date 2023, our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses increased $28 million to $1.310 billion, and the rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 29.0% from 27.4%. Our Home Office Expenses increased primarily due to higher technology expense, principally related to IT separation costs as well as strategic investments to drive future growth, and other corporate expenses. Our Selling Expenses decreased primarily due to our cost optimization work related to efficiency in store labor and selling productivity, reduced expense as we optimized our call center and the decline in Net Sales.

The General, Administrative and Store Operating Expense rate increased primarily due to our investments in technology as well as deleverage on lower Net Sales, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work related to Selling Expenses.

For year-to-date 2023, our Interest Expense was $259 million, compared to $262 million for year-to-date 2022. Our lower average daily borrowings, which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes, were partially offset by a higher average borrowing rate.

Other Income
------------

For year-to-date 2023, our Other Income was $68 million, primarily due to interest income on cash balances and pre-tax gains of $28 million associated with the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes.

Provision for Income Taxes
--------------------------

For year-to-date 2023, our effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 21.9% for year-to-date 2022. The 2023 year-to-date rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates. The 2022 year-to-date rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters during the period.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
-------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements, future common stock and debt repurchases, and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions and product expansions, profit margins, income taxes and inflationary pressures. Historically, our sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $79 million as of October 28, 2023.

During year-to-date 2023, we repurchased and extinguished $373 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate price of $343 million. Additionally, we also repurchased 2,765 thousand shares of our common stock for $100 million. We may, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire, additional debt or shares of our common stock, as applicable.

We believe that our current cash position, our cash flow generated from operations and our borrowing capacity under our asset-backed revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility") will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements, for at least the next twelve months.

Working Capital and Capitalization

Operating Activities
--------------------

Net cash provided by operating activities for year-to-date 2023 was $28 million, including net income of $299 million. Net income included depreciation of $199 million, share-based compensation expense of $29 million and pre-tax gains on extinguishment of debt of $28 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable due to seasonal tax payments.

Net cash provided by operating activities for year-to-date 2022 was $67 million, including net income of $366 million. Net income included depreciation of $162 million and share-based compensation expense of $26 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable due to seasonal tax payments.

Investing Activities
--------------------

Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2023 was $239 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included approximately $125 million related to new, off-mall stores and remodels of existing stores, approximately $75 million for various IT projects primarily supporting the separation of our IT systems from Victoria's Secret and approximately $35 million related to distribution and logistics capabilities.

Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2022 was $252 million related to capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included approximately $130 million related to new, off-mall stores and remodels of existing stores. The remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to our new Company-operated direct channel fulfillment center and IT projects.

We continue to plan for approximately $300 million to $350 million of capital expenditures in 2023, focused on investments to support long-term growth. We are prioritizing investments in select remodels to the White Barn store design and new off-mall store openings. We are also investing in our technology, distribution and logistics capabilities to better serve our customers.

Financing Activities
--------------------

Net cash used for financing activities for year-to-date 2023 was $609 million, primarily consisting of $343 million for open market debt repurchases, dividend payments of $0.60 per share, or $137 million, $99 million for share repurchases and $10 million of tax payments related to share-based awards.

Net cash used for financing activities for year-to-date 2022 was $1.499 billion consisting of $1.312 billion in payments for share repurchases, including the payment of $1 billion related to our accelerated share repurchase program, dividend payments of $0.60 per share, or $140 million, and $32 million of tax payments related to sharebased awards.

Common Stock and Debt Repurchases
---------------------------------

Our Board of Directors (our "Board") will determine share and debt repurchase authorizations, giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share and debt repurchase programs. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions.

Common Stock Repurchases
------------------------

2022 Share Repurchase Program
-----------------------------

In February 2022, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program (the "February 2022 Program"). Under the February 2022 Program, we repurchased the following shares of our common stock during year-to-date 2023:

Table of Contents

| Repurchase Program | Amount Authorized (in millions) | Shares Repurchased | Amount Repurchased | Average Stock Price |

|  |  | (in thousands) | (in millions) |  |
| February 2022 | $ 1,500 | 2,765 | 100 | $ 36.16 |

The February 2022 Program had $88 million of remaining authority as of October 28, 2023. There were share repurchases of $1 million reflected in Accounts Payable on the October 28, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent to October 28, 2023 through December 1, 2023, we repurchased an additional 569 thousand shares of our common stock for $17 million under the February 2022 Program.

Dividend Policy and Procedures
------------------------------

Our Board will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.

Subsequent to October 28, 2023 through December 1, 2023, we repurchased in the open market and extinguished $93 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate repurchase price of $86 million.

Asset-backed Revolving Credit Facility
--------------------------------------

We and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure our ABL Facility. The ABL Facility, which allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, has aggregate commitments of $750 million and an expiration date in August 2026.

In the second quarter of 2023, we amended our ABL Facility to replace the LIBOR-based rate with a SOFR-based rate as the interest rate benchmark on U.S. dollar borrowings. This amendment made no other material changes to the terms of the ABL Facility.

Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on our eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, we are required to repay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of October 28, 2023, our borrowing base was $1.169 billion, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $10 million of outstanding letters of credit as of October 28, 2023 that reduced our availability under the ABL Facility. As of October 28, 2023, our availability under the ABL Facility was $740 million.

As of October 28, 2023, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.25% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the Term SOFR plus 1.25% and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. The interest rate on outstanding Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings was the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 1.25% per annum.

The ABL Facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $70 million or (ii) 10% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of October 28, 2023, we were not required to maintain this ratio.

Credit Ratings

Guarantor Summarized Financial Information
------------------------------------------

Certain of our subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have guaranteed our obligations under the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2036 Notes (collectively, the "Notes").

The Notes have been issued by Bath & Body Works, Inc. (the "Parent Company"). The Notes are its senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations, are senior to

any of our future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our ABL Facility (such guarantees, the "Guarantees"; and, such guaranteeing subsidiaries, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Each Guarantee is limited, by its terms, to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law.

The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (ii) investments in and equity in the earnings of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations
--------------------------------------------------

Lease Guarantees
----------------

In connection with the spin-off of Victoria's Secret and the disposal of a certain other business, we had remaining contingent obligations of $267 million as of October 28, 2023 related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases, primarily related to office space, expiring at various dates through 2037. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of these businesses. Our reserves related to these obligations were not significant for any period presented.

Contractual Obligations
-----------------------

Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Other than the repurchase of $373 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes through year-to-date 2023, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations subsequent to January 28, 2023, as discussed in "Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations" in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our business).

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
-----------------------------------------

We did not adopt any new accounting standards year-to-date 2023 that had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, as of December 1, 2023, there were no new accounting standards that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, valuation of long-lived store assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition, including revenue associated with our loyalty program. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Risk
-----------

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
--------------------------

Our Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in Canada, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates.

Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Interest Rate Risk
------------------

Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.

All of our Long-term Debt as of October 28, 2023 has fixed interest rates. We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
-----------------------------------

The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of our outstanding Long-term Debt as of October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022:

Table of Contents

|  | October 28, 2023 | January 28, 2023 | October 29, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Principal Value | $ 4,542 | $ 4,915 | 4,915 |
| Fair Value, Estimated (a) | 4,122 | 4,707 | 4,367 |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As of October 28, 2023, we believe that the carrying values of our Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses approximate their fair values because of their short maturities.

Concentration of Credit Risk
----------------------------

We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-------------------------------

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the third quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION
-------------------------

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
-------------------------

We are a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against our Company from time to time may include commercial, tort, intellectual property, tax, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, our current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act Cases
-----------------------------------------------

We were named as a defendant in three putative class actions: Smidga, et al. v. Bath & Body Works, LLC in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas; Dahlin v. Bath & Body Works, LLC in the Santa Barbara County, California Superior Court; and Blanco v. Bath & Body Works, LLC in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court. The complaints each allege that we violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act by printing more than the last five digits of credit or debit card numbers on customers' receipts and, among other things, seek statutory damages, attorneys' fees and costs. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs in the Smidga and Dahlin cases that will resolve those matters, which is subject to court approval. The Blanco case was sent to individual arbitration by court order, and we have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiff that will resolve the Blanco arbitration and lawsuit. The resolutions of these claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
---------------------

The risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We wish to caution the reader that the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and those described elsewhere in this report or other SEC filings could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statements.
