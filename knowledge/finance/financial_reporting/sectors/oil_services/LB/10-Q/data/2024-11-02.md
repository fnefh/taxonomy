<h2>BATH &amp; BODY WORKS, INC.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<ol>
<li>Description of Business and Basis of Presentation</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Description of Business</h2>
<p>Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (the "Company") is a global omnichannel retailer focused on personal care and home fragrance. The Company sells merchandise through its retail stores in the United States of America ("U.S.") and Canada, and through its websites and other channels, under the Bath &amp; Body Works®, White Barn® and other brand names. The Company's international business is conducted through franchise, license and wholesale partners. The Company operates as and reports a single segment.</p>
<h2>Fiscal Year</h2>
<p>The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, "third quarter of 2024" and "third quarter of 2023" refer to the thirteen-week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. "Year-to-date 2024" and "year-to-date 2023" refer to the thirty-nine-week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Basis of Consolidation</h2>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee's net income or loss. Losses are only recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below zero if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company's share of net income or loss of all unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company's equity method investments are required to be reviewed for impairment when it is determined there may be an other-than-temporary loss in value.</p>
<h2>Interim Financial Statements</h2>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 are unaudited and are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods.</p>
<h2>Seasonality of Business</h2>
<p>The Company's operations are seasonal in nature and consist oftwo principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The Company's sales are highest during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Due to the seasonal variations in the retail industry, the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.</p>
<h2>Derivative Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The Company's Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all the Company's merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure. Amounts are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All designated cash flow hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The fair value of designated cash flow hedges is not significant for any period presented. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.</p>
<h2>Concentration of Credit Risk</h2>
<p>The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom it transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company's investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>The Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company determines the required allowance for expected credit losses using information such as customer credit history and financial condition. Amounts are recorded to the allowance when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur.</p>
<h2>Easton Investments</h2>
<p>The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a planned community in Columbus, Ohio, that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, totaling $120 million as of November 2, 2024, $120 million as of February 3, 2024 and $127 million as of October 28, 2023, are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p>Subsequent to November 2, 2024, the Company began actively marketing for sale certain of its Easton investments. As a result of meeting all of the required criteria, these investments will be presented as held for sale and reported in Other Current Assets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. The carrying value of this held for sale disposal group was approximately $100 million as of November 2, 2024, consisting primarily of undeveloped land.</p>
<p>Previously included in the Company's Easton investments were equity interests in Easton Town Center, LLC ("ETC") and Easton Gateway, LLC ("EG"), entities that own and develop commercial entertainment and shopping centers. The Company's investments in ETC and EG were accounted for using the equity method of accounting. On May 10, 2024, the Company sold its entire interest in the business associated with EG, and on August 1, 2024, the Company sold its entire interest in ETC. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of $50 million at the closing of these sales, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $39 million net of fees, which is included in Other Income in the year-to-date 2024 Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.</p>
<h2>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance, and applies to companies with a single reportable segment. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is finalizing its assessment of the impact of adopting this standard and expects to have additional disclosures in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , that requires enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , that requires disclosures of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively, with the option to apply retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its disclosures.</p>

<h2>Asset-backed Revolving Credit Facility</h2>
<p>The Company and certain of the Company's 100% owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure an asset-backed revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility"). The ABL Facility, which allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars, has aggregate commitments of $750 million and an expiration date in August 2026.</p>
<p>Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on the Company's eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, the Company is required to repay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of November 2, 2024, the Company's borrowing base was $1.123 billion, and it had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility supports the Company's letter of credit program. The Company had $10 million of outstanding letters of credit as of November 2, 2024 that reduced its availability under the ABL Facility. As of November 2, 2024, the Company's availability under the ABL Facility was $740 million.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2024, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.25% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25% and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility requires the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $70 million or (ii) 10% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of November 2, 2024, the Company was not required to maintain this ratio.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fair Value Measurements</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. The Company's Cash and Cash Equivalents are considered Level 1 fair value measurements as they are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.</p>
<p>The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding debt as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023:</p>
<p>| | November 2, 2024 | February 3, 2024 | October 28, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Principal Value | $ 4,230 | $ 4,430 | $ 4,542 |
| Fair Value, Estimated (a) | 4,273 | 4,456 | 4,122 |</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>Management believes that the carrying values of the Company's Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses approximate their fair values because of their short maturities.</p>

<li>Commitments and Contingencies</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against the Company from time to time may include commercial, tort, intellectual property, tax, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Lease Guarantees</h2>
<p>In connection with the spin-off of Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. and the disposal of a certain other business, the Company had remaining contingent obligations of $248 million as of November 2, 2024 related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases, primarily related to office space, expiring at various dates through 2037.

<h2>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</h2>
<p>To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc.</p>
<h2>Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements</h2>
<p>We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (the Company) as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and total equity (deficit) for the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the consolidated statements of cash flows for the thirty-nine week periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated interim financial statements"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of February 3, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.</p>
<h2>Basis for Review Results</h2>
<p>These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.</p>

The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>
<h2>Executive Overview</h2>
<p>In the third quarter of 2024, consolidated Net Sales were $1.610 billion, which increased $48 million, or 3.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Total North American Net Sales increased $56 million, primarily due to new store growth and an approximately 200 basis point benefit from the shifted fiscal calendar resulting from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in International Net Sales. Our third quarter Operating Income was $218 million, which decreased $3 million, or 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, and our Operating Income rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 13.5% from 14.1%. The Operating Income rate declined primarily due to incremental marketing investments to drive customer acquisition and strategically planned promotional activities, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work discussed below.</p>
<p>For additional information related to our third quarter 2024 financial performance, see "Results of Operations."</p>
<h2>Cost Optimization</h2>
<p>We are focused on enhancing our operational excellence and efficiency by targeting an aggregate of $300 million of planned annual cost savings across both Gross Profit and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, which is up $20 million from our previous expectations. We delivered approximately $150 million of annual cost reductions as part of this initiative in fiscal 2023, and now expect approximately $150 million in additional annual cost savings in fiscal 2024. Our cost optimization work delivered approximately $35 million and $115 million in cost savings in the third quarter of and year-to-date 2024, respectively.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, the market remains competitive with a value conscious consumer. Our strategic priorities are focused on driving revenue growth through our core categories, supported by newness and innovation to create customer demand and convey the quality and value of our products. We are also focused on extending our reach by expanding and diversifying our product portfolio through category adjacencies, including men's, hair, lip, and laundry, and expansion of off-mall stores and international geographies. We are continuing to invest in marketing, loyalty and in foundational tools and systems enabling new capabilities that we believe will increase customer engagement and provide a more seamless and convenient cross-channel shopping experience. We also continue to focus on enhancing operational excellence and efficiency through the cost optimization discussed above, which will support our strategic priorities.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Financial Information</h2>
<p>In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, provided below are non-GAAP measures that present Net Income and Net Income Per Diluted Share for the third quarters of and year-to-date 2024 and 2023 on an adjusted basis to remove certain items. We believe that these items are not indicative of our operations due to their size and nature.</p>
<p>We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definitions of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.</p>

<h2>Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of 2023</h2>
<p>Net Sales</p>
<p>The following table provides Net Sales for the third quarter of 2024 in comparison to the third quarter of 2023:</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2023 | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | (in millions) | |
| Stores - U.S. and Canada (a) | $ 1,220 | $ 1,168 | 4.4 % |
| Direct - U.S. and Canada | 321 | 317 | 1.5 % |
| International (b) | 69 | 77 | (11.1 %) |
| Total Net Sales | $ 1,610 | $ 1,562 | 3.0 % |</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, Net Sales increased $48 million, or 3.0%, to $1.610 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Stores Net Sales increased $52 million, or 4.4%, due to new store growth, an increase in BOPIS fulfilled orders and the benefit of the shifted fiscal calendar, partially offset by the decline in average dollar sale. Direct Net Sales increased $4 million, or 1.5%, primarily driven by an increased average order size, partially offset by a decline in fulfilled orders, which was primarily due to our customers continuing to select our BOPIS option (which is recognized as store Net Sales). International Net Sales decreased $8 million, or 11.1%, driven by a decline in wholesale shipments to our franchise partners affected by the war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, Net Sales benefited by approximately 200 basis points from the shifted fiscal calendar resulting from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit</h2>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, our Gross Profit increased $18 million to $700 million, and our Gross Profit rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) decreased to 43.5%, from 43.6% in the third quarter of 2023. Gross Profit dollars increased due to an increase in Net Sales.</p>
<p>Gross Profit rate was about flat as category mix shifts drove both higher average unit retails and average unit costs. Gross Profit rate benefited from continued cost savings, offset by strategically planned promotional activities in the quarter.</p>
<h2>General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>The following table provides detail for our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023:</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2024 | 2023 | 2023 | Change | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | % of Net Sales | (in millions) | % of Net Sales | (in millions) | % of Net Sales |

| Total | $ 482 | 30.0 % | $ 461 | 29.5 % | $ 21 | 0.5 % |</p>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses increased $21 million to $482 million, and the rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 30.0% from 29.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Our Selling Expenses increased primarily due to increases in store count and associate wages, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work. Increases in Marketing Expenses, primarily due to additional spend to drive customer acquisition, were partially offset by decreases in Home Office Expenses, primarily due to discrete corporate expenses in the prior year and benefits of our cost optimization work.</p>
<p>The General, Administrative and Store Operating Expense rate increased primarily due to our investments in marketing and the increase in associate wages, partially offset by lapping discrete corporate expenses in the prior year and the benefits of our cost optimization work.</p>
<h2>Other Income and Expenses</h2>
<h2>Interest Expense</h2>
<p>The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023:</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average daily borrowings (in millions) | 4,230 | 4,658 |
| Average borrowing rate | 7.3 % | 7.4 % |</p>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, our Interest Expense was $77 million, compared to $84 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to lower average daily borrowings which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes and lower average borrowing rate.</p>
<h2>Other Income</h2>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, our Other Income was $4 million, compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $12 million pre-tax gain on the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes in the third quarter of 2023 and lower interest income on invested cash in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Provision for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>For the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was 26.7% compared to 25.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The 2024 third quarter rate was higher than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. The 2023 third quarter rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates.</p>
<h2>Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>Year-to-Date 2024 Compared to Year-to-Date 2023</h2>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, Operating Income decreased $1 million to $588 million, from $589 million year-to-date 2023, and the Operating Income rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) remained flat at 13.0%. The drivers of the year-to-date Operating Income results are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<h2>Net Sales</h2>
<p>The following table provides Net Sales for year-to-date 2024 in comparison to year-to-date 2023:</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2023 | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | (in millions) | |
| Stores - U.S. and Canada (a) | $ 3,425 | $ 3,345 | 2.4 % |
| Direct - U.S. and Canada | 879 | 926 | (5.0 %) |
| International (b) | 216 | 246 | (12.5 %) |
| Total Net Sales | $ 4,520 | $ 4,517 | - % |</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, Net Sales increased $3 million to $4.520 billion, which was about flat to year-to-date 2023. Stores Net Sales increased $80 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to new store growth, an increase in BOPIS fulfilled orders and the benefit of the shifted fiscal calendar, partially offset by the decline in average dollar sale. Direct Net Sales decreased $47 million, or 5.0%, driven by a decline in fulfilled orders, which was primarily due to our customers continuing to select our BOPIS option (which is recognized as store Net Sales), partially offset by an increased average order size. We completed our rollout of BOPIS capabilities to our U.S. stores in the first quarter of 2023. International Net Sales decreased $30 million, or 12.5%, driven by a decline in wholesale shipments to our franchise partners affected by the war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, Net Sales benefited by approximately 140 basis points from the shifted fiscal calendar resulting from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Gross Profit</h2>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, our Gross Profit increased $34 million to $1.933 billion, and our Gross Profit rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 42.8% from 42.0% year-to-date 2023. Gross Profit dollars and rate increased primarily due to an increase in the merchandise margin rate, driven by cost saving initiatives and mix, partially offset by our continued investment in product formulations and packaging innovation and strategically planned promotional activities.</p>
<h2>General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>The following table provides detail for our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses for year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023:</p>

<p>For year-to-date 2024, our General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses increased $35 million to $1.345 billion, and the rate (expressed as a percentage of Net Sales) increased to 29.8% from 29.0%. Our Selling Expenses increased primarily due to increases in associate wages, store count and BOPIS fees, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work. Increases in Marketing Expenses, primarily due to additional spend to drive customer acquisition, were partially offset by decreases in Home Office Expenses, primarily due to discrete corporate expenses in the prior year and benefits of our cost optimization work.</p>
<p>The General, Administrative and Store Operating Expense rate increased primarily due to our investments in marketing and the increase in associate wages, partially offset by lapping discrete corporate expenses in the prior year and the benefits of our cost optimization work.</p>
<h2>Other Income and Expenses</h2>
<h2>Interest Expense</h2>
<p>The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for year-to-date 2024 and 2023:</p>
<p>| | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average daily borrowings (in millions) | 4,291 | 4,774 |
| Average borrowing rate | 7.3 % | 7.3 % |</p>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, our Interest Expense was $236 million, compared to $259 million for year-to-date 2023. The decrease was due to lower average daily borrowings, which were driven by the repurchase and early extinguishment of outstanding notes.</p>
<h2>Other Income</h2>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, our Other Income was $65 million, compared to $68 million for year-to-date 2023. Included in year-to-date 2024 is a $39 million pre-tax gain on sales of certain Easton investments in the second quarter of 2024 and the recognition of a $3 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of outstanding notes. Included in year-to-date 2023 is a $28 million pre-tax gain on the repurchase and early extinguishments of outstanding notes. The remaining difference in Other Income between the periods was primarily due to lower interest income on invested cash during the year-to-date 2024.</p>
<h2>Provision for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>For year-to-date 2024, our effective tax rate was 17.2% compared to 24.9% for year-to-date 2023. The 2024 year-to-date rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the sales of Easton investments during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. The 2023 year-to-date rate was consistent with our combined estimated federal and state statutory rates.</p>
<h2>FINANCIAL CONDITION</h2>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements, future common stock and debt repurchases, and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions and product and market expansions, profit margins, income taxes and inflationary pressures. Our sales are highest during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period. Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $47 million as of November 2, 2024.</p>
<p>We repurchased and extinguished $200 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate price of $202 million during year-to-date 2024. Additionally, we repurchased 8.963 million shares of our common stock for $348 million during year-to-date 2024. We may, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire, additional debt or shares of our common stock, as applicable.</p>
<p>We believe that our current cash position, our cash flows generated from operations and our borrowing capacity under our asset-backed revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility") will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements, for at least the next twelve months.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows</h2>
<p>The following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity during year-to-date 2024 and 2023:</p>

| Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period | $ 191 | $ 412 |</p>
<h2>Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used for operating activities for year-to-date 2024 was $69 million, including net income of $345 million. Net income included depreciation of $211 million, impacts to deferred income taxes of $103 million, an aggregate pre-tax gain on sales of certain Easton investments of $39 million, and share-based compensation expense of $31 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable) as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable, due to seasonal tax payments.</p>
<p>Net cash provided by operating activities for year-to-date 2023 was $28 million, including net income of $299 million. Net income included depreciation of $199 million, share-based compensation expense of $29 million and pre-tax gains on extinguishment of debt of $28 million. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant items in working capital were the seasonal changes in Inventories (and related increases in Accounts Payable), as we build our inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, which generates a substantial portion of our operating cash flow for the year, and Income Taxes Payable due to seasonal tax payments.</p>
<h2>Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2024 was $114 million primarily related to capital expenditures of $166 million, partially offset by aggregate cash proceeds, net of fees, of $40 million related to the sales of certain Easton investments. The capital expenditures included approximately $115 million related to new, primarily off-mall, stores and remodels of existing stores, approximately $30 million for various IT projects primarily to support the growth and profitability of our business, and approximately $20 million related to distribution and logistics capabilities.</p>
<p>Net cash used for investing activities for year-to-date 2023 was $239 million, primarily related to capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included approximately $125 million related to new, off-mall stores and remodels of existing stores, approximately $75 million for various IT projects primarily supporting the separation of our IT systems from Victoria's Secret and approximately $35 million related to distribution and logistics capabilities.</p>
<p>In 2024, our top priority remains driving sustainable, long-term, profitable growth through investments in the business. To support this, we are planning investments totaling approximately $250 million during the year, the vast majority of which will be reported as capital expenditures, and our priorities remain investments in brickand-mortar stores and in technology.</p>
<h2>Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used for financing activities for year-to-date 2024 was $710 million, primarily consisting of $349 million for share repurchases, $202 million for open market debt repurchases, dividend payments of $0.60 per share, or $134 million, and $16 million of tax payments related to share-based awards.</p>
<p>Net cash used for financing activities for year-to-date 2023 was $609 million, primarily consisting of $343 million for open market debt repurchases, dividend payments of $0.60 per share, or $137 million, $99 million for share repurchases and $10 million of tax payments related to share-based awards.</p>
<h2>Common Stock and Debt Repurchases</h2>
<p>Our Board of Directors (our "Board") will determine share and debt repurchase authorizations, giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our share and debt repurchase programs. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be made at our discretion, taking into account a number of factors, including market conditions.</p>
<h2>Common Stock Repurchases</h2>
<h2>2022 Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>In February 2022, our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program (the "February 2022 Program"). Under the February 2022 Program, we repurchased the following shares of our common stock during year-to-date 2024 and 2023:</p>

<h2>2024 Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>In January 2024, our Board authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program (the "January 2024 Program"). Under the January 2024 Program, we repurchased the following shares of our common stock during year-to-date 2024:</p>
<p>| Repurchase Program | Shares Repurchased | Amount Repurchased | Average Stock Price |

<p>The January 2024 Program had $191 million of remaining authority as of November 2, 2024. There were share repurchases of $1 million reflected in Accounts Payable on the November 2, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheet.</p>
<h2>Dividend Policy and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our Board will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends.</p>

<h2>Repurchases of Notes</h2>
<p>We did not repurchase any outstanding senior notes in the third quarter of 2024. For year-to-date 2024, we repurchased in the open market and extinguished $200 million principal amounts of our outstanding senior notes. The aggregate repurchase price for these notes was $202 million, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $3 million, including the write-off of unamortized issuance costs. This loss is included in Other Income in the year-to-date 2024 Consolidated Statement of Income.</p>
<p>During the third quarter of and year-to-date 2023, we repurchased in the open market and extinguished $174 million and $373 million principal amounts of our outstanding senior notes, respectively. The aggregate repurchase price for these notes were $161 million and $343 million for the third quarter of and year-to-date 2023, respectively, resulting in pre-tax gains of $12 million and $28 million, including the write-off of unamortized issuance costs, during the third quarter of and year-to-date 2023, respectively. These gains are included in Other Income in the 2023 Consolidated Statements of Income.</p>

<h2>Asset-backed Revolving Credit Facility</h2>
<p>We and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility, which allows borrowings and letters of credit in U.S. dollars, has aggregate commitments of $750 million and an expiration date in August 2026.</p>
<p>Availability under the ABL Facility is the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, determined primarily based on our eligible U.S. and Canadian credit card receivables, accounts receivable, inventory and eligible real property, or (ii) the aggregate commitment. If at any time the outstanding amount under the ABL Facility exceeds the lesser of (i) the borrowing base and (ii) the aggregate commitment, we are required to repay the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility to the extent of such excess. As of November 2, 2024, our borrowing base was $1.123 billion, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had $10 million of outstanding letters of credit as of November 2, 2024 that reduced our availability under the ABL Facility. As of November 2, 2024, our availability under the ABL Facility was $740 million.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2024, the ABL Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were 0.30% per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 1.25% per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings was the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25% and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum.</p>
<p>The ABL Facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $70 million or (ii) 10% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of November 2, 2024, we were not required to maintain this ratio.</p>
<h2>Credit Ratings</h2>

<h2>Guarantor Summarized Financial Information</h2>
<p>Certain of our subsidiaries, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have guaranteed our obligations under the 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2035 Notes and 2036 Notes (collectively, the "Notes").</p>
<p>The Notes have been issued by Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (the "Parent Company"). The Notes are its senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured obligations, are senior to any of our future subordinated indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.</p>
<p>The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our ABL Facility (such guarantees, the "Guarantees"; and, such guaranteeing subsidiaries, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. Each Guarantee is limited, by its terms, to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law.</p>
<p>The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and (ii) investments in and equity in the earnings of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.</p>

<h2>Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations</h2>
<h2>Lease Guarantees</h2>
<p>In connection with the spin-off of Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. and the disposal of a certain other business, we had remaining contingent obligations of $248 million as of November 2, 2024 related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases, primarily related to office space, expiring at various dates through 2037. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of these businesses. Our reserves related to these obligations were not significant for any period presented.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Contractual Obligations</h2>
<p>Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and the related interest payments, operating leases, purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other long-term obligations. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Other than the repurchase of $200 million principal amounts of our outstanding senior notes during year-to-date 2024, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations subsequent to February 3, 2024, as discussed in "Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of our contractual obligations may fluctuate during the normal course of business (primarily changes in our merchandise inventory-related purchase obligations which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our business).</p>
<h2>RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance, and applies to companies with a single reportable segment. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are finalizing our assessment of the impact of adopting this standard and expect to have additional disclosures in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , that requires enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , that requires disclosures of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied prospectively, with the option to apply retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.</p>
<h2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, valuation of long-lived store assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition, including revenue associated with our loyalty program. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
<p>There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h2>Market Risk</h2>
<p>The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.</p>
<h2>Foreign Exchange Rate Risk</h2>
<p>Our Canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in Canada is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in Canada, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates.</p>
<p>Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.</p>
<p>All of our outstanding debt as of November 2, 2024 has fixed interest rates. We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of our outstanding debt as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023:</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>| | November 2, 2024 | February 3, 2024 | October 28, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Principal Value | $ 4,230 | $ 4,430 | $ 4,542 |
| Fair Value, Estimated (a) | 4,273 | 4,456 | 4,122 |</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2024, we believe that the carrying values of our Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses approximate their fair values because of their short maturities.</p>
<h2>Concentration of Credit Risk</h2>
<p>We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Our investment portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.</p>
<h2>Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II-OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</h2>
<p>We are a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against the Company from time to time may include commercial, tort, intellectual property, tax, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, our current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act Cases</h2>
<p>We were named as a defendant in two putative class actions: Smidga, et al. v. Bath &amp; Body Works, LLC in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas and Dahlin v. Bath &amp; Body Works, LLC in the Santa Barbara County, California Superior Court. The complaints each alleged that we violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act by printing more than the last five digits of credit or debit card numbers on customers' receipts and, among other things, sought statutory damages, attorneys' fees and costs. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs in these cases that resolves both matters. The cases were consolidated in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, which issued final approval of the settlement on October 24, 2024. The resolution of these claims had no material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>The risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We wish to caution the reader that the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and those described elsewhere in this report or other SEC filings could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statements.</p>
