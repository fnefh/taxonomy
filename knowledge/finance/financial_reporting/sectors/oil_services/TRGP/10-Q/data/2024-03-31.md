<h2>CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>Targa Resources Corp.'s (together with its subsidiaries, including Targa Resources Partners LP (the "Partnership"), "we," "us," "our," "Targa," "TRGP," or the "Company") reports, filings and other public announcements may from time to time contain statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. Such statements are "forward-looking statements." You can typically identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by the use of forward-looking statements, such as "may," "could," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "potential," "plan," "forecast" and other similar words.</p>
<p>All statements that are not statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>These forward-looking statements reflect our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements include known and unknown risks. Known risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:</p>
<ul>
<li>·the level and success of crude oil and natural gas drilling around our assets, our success in connecting natural gas supplies to our gathering and processing systems, oil supplies to our gathering systems and natural gas liquid supplies to our logistics and transportation facilities and our success in connecting our facilities to transportation services and markets;</li>
<li>·actions taken by other countries with significant hydrocarbon production;</li>
<li>·the timing and extent of changes in natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and other commodity prices, interest rates and demand for our services;</li>
<li>·our ability to grow through internal growth capital projects or acquisitions and the successful integration and future performance of such assets;</li>
<li>·the timing and success of business development efforts;</li>
<li>·our ability to timely obtain and maintain necessary licenses, permits and other approvals;</li>
<li>·industry changes, including the impact of consolidation, changes in competition and the drive to reduce fossil fuel use and substitute alternative forms of energy for oil and gas;</li>
<li>·downside commodity price volatility from a variety of potential factors that can result in lower activity in our areas of operation;</li>
</ul>
<p>·our success in risk management activities, including the use of derivative instruments to hedge commodity price risks;</p>
<ul>
<li>·general economic, market and business conditions;</li>
</ul>
<p>·the impact of outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or any other public health crises;</p>
<p>·weather and other natural phenomena, and related impacts;</p>
<p>·our ability to access the capital markets, which will depend on general market conditions, including the impact of increased interest rates, the potential for additional rate increases, associated Federal Reserve policies and potential economic recession, our credit ratings and leverage levels, and demand for our common equity, senior notes and commercial paper;</p>
<p>·the amount of collateral required to be posted from time to time in our transactions;</p>
<p>·the level of creditworthiness of counterparties to various transactions with us;</p>
<ul>
<li>·the impact of disruptions in the bank and capital markets, including those resulting from lack of access to liquidity for banking and financial services firms;</li>
<li>·changes in laws and regulations, particularly with regard to taxes, safety and the protection of the environment; and</li>
</ul>
<p>·the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("Annual Report") and our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").</p>
<p>Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and, therefore, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 ("Quarterly Report") will prove to be accurate. Some of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements are more fully described in our Annual Report. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or advise of any change in any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>

<h2>TARGA RESOURCES CORP.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<p>Except as noted within the context of each footnote disclosure, the dollar amounts presented in the tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in millions of dollars.</p>
<h2>Note 1 - Organization and Operations</h2>
<h2>Our Organization</h2>
<p>Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation formed in October 2005. Targa is a leading provider of midstream services and is one of the largest independent infrastructure companies in North America. We own, operate, acquire, and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary domestic midstream infrastructure assets.</p>
<p>In this Quarterly Report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to "we," "us," "our," "the Company," "Targa" or "TRGP" are intended to mean our consolidated business and operations. TRGP controls the general partner of and owns all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Targa Resources Partners LP, referred to herein as the "Partnership". Targa consolidates the Partnership and its subsidiaries under GAAP, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Targa's consolidated financial statements include differences from the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. The most noteworthy differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>·the inclusion of the TRGP senior revolving credit facility and term loan facility;</li>
<li>·the inclusion of the TRGP senior notes;</li>
<li>·the inclusion of the TRGP commercial paper notes; and</li>
<li>·the impacts of TRGP's treatment as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Operations</h2>
<p>The Company is primarily engaged in the business of:</p>
<ul>
<li>·gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas;</li>
<li>·transporting, storing, fractionating, treating, and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and ·gathering, storing, terminaling, and purchasing and selling crude oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>See Note 16 - Segment Information for certain financial information regarding our business segments.</p>
<h2>Note 2 - Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all information and disclosures required by GAAP. Therefore, this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods reported. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>The accounting policies that we follow are set forth in Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report. Other than the updates noted below, there were no significant updates or revisions to our accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted</h2>
<h2>Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this update require, among other items, that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. Additionally, the amendments require annual disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and how that individual uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources.</p>
<p>These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The disclosures required in the amendments apply retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the effect of the amendments on our consolidated financial statements and expect to disclose the required information for fiscal years beginning in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for interim periods beginning in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.</p>
<h2>Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this update require, among other items, that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis, (i) specific categories of income taxes in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) a disaggregation of income taxes paid by federal, state, and foreign taxes.</p>
<p>These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are required to be applied prospectively with retrospective application permitted. We are evaluating the effect of the amendments on our consolidated financial statements and expect to disclose the required information beginning in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025.</p>
<h2>Note 4 - Acquisitions</h2>
<p>In January 2023, we completed the acquisition of Blackstone Energy Partners' 25% interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture (the "Grand Prix Transaction") for aggregate consideration of $1.05 billion in cash and a final closing adjustment of $41.9 million. Following the closing of the Grand Prix Transaction, we own 100% of the interest in Grand Prix. The change in our ownership interests was accounted for as an equity transaction representing the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the redemption price in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax, was $490.7 million, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.</p>

<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense was $247.2 million and $228.8 million, respectively.</p>
<h2>Intangible Assets</h2>
<p>Intangible assets consist of customer contracts and customer relationships acquired in prior business combinations. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were determined at the date of acquisition based on the present values of estimated future cash flows. Amortization expense attributable to these assets is recorded over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers.</p>
<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization expense was $93.3 million and $96.0 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $373.2 million, $326.0 million, $279.8 million, $252.2 million and $234.0 million for each of the years 2024 through 2028, respectively.</p>

<h2>Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>We have certain long-term contractual arrangements for which we have received consideration that we are not yet able to recognize as revenue. The resulting deferred revenue will be recognized once all conditions for revenue recognition have been met.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $119.1 million and $248.8 million, respectively. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 included $129.0 million of payments received from Vitol Americas Corp. ("Vitol") (formerly known as Noble Americas Corp.), a subsidiary of Vitol US Holding Co., in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as part of an agreement (the "Splitter Agreement") related to the construction and operation of a crude oil and condensate splitter. In December 2018, Vitol elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement. As a result of a legal ruling in April 2024, the $129.0 million payments from Vitol were reclassified to Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024. See Note 12 - Contingencies for further details.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue includes nonmonetary consideration received in a 2015 amendment to a gas gathering and processing agreement and consideration received for other construction activities of facilities connected to our systems. Deferred revenue also includes contributions in aid of construction received from customers for which revenue is recognized over the expected contract term.</p>

<h2>Note 8 - Common Stock and Related Matters</h2>
<h2>Common Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>In October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2020 Share Repurchase Program") for the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock. During the second quarter of 2023, we exhausted the 2020 Share Repurchase Program.</p>
<p>In May 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2023 Share Repurchase Program") for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased 1,186,444 shares of our common stock at a weighted average per share price of $104.26 for a total net cost of $123.7 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased 724,140 shares of our common stock at a weighted average per share price of $71.82 for a total net cost of $52.0 million.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, there was $646.4 million remaining under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program and may discontinue the program at any time.</p>
<h2>Common Stock Dividends</h2>
<p>In April 2024, we declared an increase to our common dividend to $0.75 per common share, or $3.00 per common share annualized effective for the first quarter of 2024.</p>

<h2>Note 9 - Earnings per Common Share</h2>
<p>In March 2023, the Compensation Committee amended the Restricted Stock Units Grant Agreements that govern the Restricted Stock Unit awards ("RSUs") that vest no later than three years following the RSUs' grant date. The amendment resulted in quarterly cash dividend payments to RSU holders beginning with the common stock dividend paid in May 2023. As the amended RSUs and certain four-year retention awards participate in nonforfeitable dividends with the common equity owners of the Company, they are considered participating securities.</p>
<p>We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method. Earnings are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings to the extent that each security participates in earnings.</p>
<p>The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share:</p>

<h2>Note 10 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price risks associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. The hedge positions associated with (i) and (ii) above will move favorably in periods of falling commodity prices and unfavorably in periods of rising commodity prices and are primarily designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>The hedges generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL delivery points of our physical equity volumes. Our natural gas hedges are a mixture of specific gas delivery points and Henry Hub. The NGL hedges may be transacted as specific NGL hedges or as baskets of ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity NGL composition. We believe this approach avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as "proxy" hedges of NGL prices. Our natural gas and NGL hedges are settled using published index prices for delivery at various locations.</p>
<p>We hedge a portion of our condensate equity volumes using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude, which approximates the prices received for condensate. This exposes us to a market differential risk if the NYMEX futures do not move in exact parity with the sales price of our underlying condensate equity volumes.</p>
<p>We also enter into derivative instruments to help manage other short-term commodity-related business risks and take advantage of market opportunities. We have not designated these derivatives as hedges and record changes in fair value and cash settlements to revenues as current income.</p>
<p>At March 31, 2024, the notional volumes of our commodity derivative contracts were:</p>

<p>Our derivative contracts are subject to netting arrangements that permit our contracting subsidiaries to net cash settle offsetting asset and liability positions with the same counterparty within the same Targa entity. The master netting provisions reduced our maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk by $35.2 million as of March 31, 2024. The range of losses attributable to our individual counterparties would be between $0.1 million and $7.3 million, depending on the counterparty in default. We record derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, without considering the effect of master netting arrangements.</p>

<p>Some of our hedges are futures contracts executed through brokers that clear the hedges through an exchange. We maintain a margin deposit with the brokers in an amount sufficient to cover the fair value of our open futures positions. The margin deposit is considered collateral, which is located within Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not offset against the fair value of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments other than our futures contracts are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements ("ISDAs"), which govern the key terms with our counterparties. Our ISDAs contain creditrisk related contingent features. Following the release of the collateral securing our TRGP Revolver, our derivative positions are no longer secured. As of March 31, 2024, we have outstanding net derivative positions that contain credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position of $31.1 million. We have not been required to post any collateral related to these positions due to our credit rating. If our credit rating was to be downgraded one notch below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services LLC, as defined in our ISDAs, we estimate that as of March 31, 2024, we would not be required to post collateral to any counterparties per the terms of our ISDAs.</p>
<p>The fair value of our derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. The estimated fair value of our derivative instruments was a net liability of $26.9 million as of March 31, 2024. The estimated fair value is net of an adjustment for credit risk based on the default probabilities as indicated by market quotes for the counterparties' credit default swap rates. The credit risk adjustment was immaterial for all periods presented. Our futures contracts that are cleared through an exchange are margined daily and do not require any credit adjustment.</p>

<p>Based on valuations as of March 31, 2024, we expect to reclassify commodity hedge-related deferred gains of $36.4 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings before income taxes through the end of 2026, with $32.8 million of gains to be reclassified over the next twelve months.</p>
<p>Our consolidated earnings are also affected by the use of the mark-to-market method of accounting for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that have not been designated as hedges. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings rather than being deferred until the anticipated transaction settles. The use of mark-to-market accounting for financial assets and liabilities ("financial instruments") can cause non-cash earnings volatility due to changes in the underlying commodity price indices. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the unrealized mark-to-market losses are primarily attributable to unfavorable movements in natural gas forward basis prices, as compared to our positions.</p>

<p>See Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 - Segment Information for additional disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.</p>
<h2>Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Under GAAP, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a mixture of measurement methods for financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other financial instruments are reported at historical cost or amortized cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following are additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding fair value measurements of financial instruments.</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Our derivative instruments consist of financially settled commodity swaps, futures, option contracts and fixed-price forward commodity contracts with certain counterparties. We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and we believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative instruments we hold.</p>
<p>The fair values of our derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The derivatives at March 31, 2024, represent a net liability position of $26.9 million, and reflects the present value, adjusted for counterparty credit risk, of the amount we expect to receive or pay in the future on our derivative instruments. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to increase by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net liability of $137.9 million. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to decrease by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net asset of $84.2 million.</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Due to their cash or near-cash nature, the carrying value of other financial instruments included in working capital (i.e., cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable) approximates their fair value. Long-term debt is primarily the other financial instrument for which carrying value could vary significantly from fair value. We determined the supplemental fair value disclosures for our long-term debt as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>·the TRGP Revolver, commercial paper notes, Securitization Facility and Term Loan Facility are based on carrying value, which approximates fair value as their interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; and</li>
<li>·the TRGP senior unsecured notes and the Partnership's senior unsecured notes are based on quoted market prices derived from trades of the debt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fair Value Hierarchy</h2>
<p>We categorize the inputs to the fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities at each balance sheet reporting date using a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;</li>
<li>·Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that we can directly or indirectly observe to the extent that the markets are liquid for the relevant settlement periods; and</li>
<li>·Level 3 - unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore we must develop our own assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows a breakdown by fair value hierarchy category for (i) financial instruments measurements included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and (ii) supplemental fair value disclosures for other financial instruments:</p>

<p>(1)The fair value of derivative contracts in this table is presented on a different basis than the Consolidated Balance Sheets presentation as disclosed in Note 10 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The above fair values reflect the total value of each derivative contract taken as a whole, whereas the Consolidated Balance Sheets presentation is based on the individual maturity dates of estimated future settlements. As such, an individual contract could have both an asset and liability position when segregated into its current and long-term portions for Consolidated Balance Sheets classification purposes.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Included on Our Consolidated Balance Sheets</h2>
<p>We have historically reported certain of our swaps and option contracts at fair value using Level 3 inputs due to such derivatives not having observable market prices or implied volatilities for substantially the full term of the derivative asset or liability. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input was determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation was categorized in Level 3. This included derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract length extends into unobservable periods.</p>
<p>The fair value of these swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on a commodity forward curve. For these derivatives, the primary input to the valuation model was the commodity forward curve, which was based on observable or public data sources and extrapolated when observable prices were not available.</p>
<p>The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our Level 3 derivatives were the forward natural gas liquids pricing curves, for which a significant portion of the derivative's term is beyond available forward pricing. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no derivative contracts categorized as Level 3.</p>
<h2>Note 12 - Contingencies</h2>
<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>We and the Partnership are parties to various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. We and the Partnership are also parties to various proceedings with governmental environmental agencies, including, but not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, New Mexico Environment Department, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, which assert monetary sanctions for alleged violations of environmental regulations, including air emissions, discharges into the environment and reporting deficiencies, related to events that have arisen at certain of our facilities in the ordinary course of our business.</p>
<p>On December 26, 2018, Vitol filed a lawsuit in the 80th District Court of Harris County (the "District Court"), Texas against Targa Channelview LLC, then a subsidiary of the Company ("Targa Channelview"), seeking recovery of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview, additional monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Vitol alleged that Targa Channelview breached the Splitter Agreement, which provided for Targa Channelview to construct a crude oil and condensate splitter (the "Splitter") adjacent to a barge dock owned by Targa Channelview to provide services contemplated by the Splitter Agreement. In January 2018, Vitol acquired Noble Americas Corp. and on December 23, 2018, Vitol voluntarily elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement claiming that Targa Channelview failed to timely achieve startup of the Splitter. Vitol's lawsuit also alleged Targa Channelview made a series of misrepresentations about the capability of the barge dock that would service crude oil and condensate volumes to be processed by the Splitter and Splitter products. Vitol sought return of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview prior to the start-up of the Splitter, as well as additional damages. On the same date that Vitol filed its lawsuit, Targa Channelview filed a lawsuit against Vitol seeking a judicial determination that Vitol's sole and exclusive remedy was Vitol's voluntarily termination of the Splitter Agreement and, as a result, Vitol was not entitled to the return of any prior payments under the Splitter Agreement or other damages as alleged. Targa also sought recovery of its attorneys' fees and costs in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2020, the District Court awarded Vitol $129.0 million (plus interest) following a bench trial. In addition, the District Court awarded Vitol $10.5 million in damages for losses and demurrage on crude oil that Vitol purchased for start-up efforts. The Company appealed the award in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas. In October 2020, we sold Targa Channelview but, under the agreements governing the sale, we retained the liabilities associated with the Vitol proceedings. On September 13, 2022, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's judgment in part with regard to the return of Vitol's prior payments, but modified the judgment to delete Vitol's ability to recover any damages related to losses or demurrage on crude oil. We filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on October 20, 2023. We then filed a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on April 19, 2024. As a result of the April 2024 ruling, the $129.0 million payments from Vitol were reclassified from Other long-term liabilities to Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, cumulative interest on the award of $54.9 million was recorded in Interest expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024. See Note 7 - Other Long-term Liabilities.</p>
<p>On July 24, 2023, we received a Notice of Violation from the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau, relating to alleged air permit violations between August 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 by Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC, an entity we subsequently acquired in July 2022 in the Delaware Basin Acquisition and whose assets are now integrated into Targa Northern Delaware LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We have been engaging with the New Mexico Environment Department to resolve this matter. Although this matter is ongoing and management cannot predict its ultimate outcome, the resolution of this matter may result in</p>
<p>a fine or penalty in excess of $0.3 million. We do not expect that any expenditures related to this matter will be material to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2023, we received a final judgment in a lawsuit alleging a breach of contract related to the major winter storm in February 2021. The damages awarded against us are approximately $6.9 million, not including pre-judgment interest. Both parties are appealing the judgment.</p>
<p>We are also a defendant in two other breach of contract cases related to force majeure events arising during the major winter storm in February 2021. We believe that the likelihood of a partial loss could be reasonably possible, and, while it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases on an individual or consolidated basis, we estimate that the total range of potential loss resulting from all of these cases could be between $0 and $10.0 million in the aggregate. We intend to continue to vigorously defend these cases.</p>
<h2>Note 13 - Revenue</h2>
<p>Fixed consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations</p>
<p>The following table presents the estimated minimum revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period and is comprised of fixed consideration primarily attributable to contracts with minimum volume commitments, for which a guaranteed amount of revenue can be calculated. These contracts are comprised primarily of gathering and processing, fractionation, export, terminaling and storage agreements, with remaining contract terms ranging from 1 to 15 years.</p>

<p>For disclosures related to disaggregated revenue, see Note 16 - Segment Information.</p>
<h2>Note 14 - Income Taxes</h2>
<p>We record income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate and recognize specific events discretely as they occur. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is lower than the U.S. corporate statutory rate of 21% primarily due to income allocated to noncontrolling interests that is not taxable to the Company and excess tax-deductible stock compensation. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was lower than the U.S. corporate statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the release of a portion of our state tax valuation allowances in addition to income allocated to noncontrolling interests that is not taxable to the Company.</p>
<p>We regularly evaluate the realizable tax benefits of deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance, if required, based on an estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe does not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria of being realized. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our valuation allowance was $7.1 million.</p>
<p>We are subject to tax in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions and we are subject to periodic audits and reviews by taxing authorities. As of March 31, 2024, Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examinations are currently in process for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 taxable years of certain wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are responding to information requests from the IRS with respect to these audits. We are not aware of any potential audit findings that would give rise to adjustments to taxable income and do not anticipate material changes related to these audits.</p>

<h2>Note 16 - Segment Information</h2>
<p>We operate in two primary segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Transportation (also referred to as the Downstream Business). Our reportable segments include operating segments that have been aggregated based on the nature of the products and services provided.</p>
<p>Our Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering and/or purchase and sale of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells, removing impurities and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs; and assets used for the gathering and terminaling and/or purchase and sale of crude oil. The Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays); and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Our Logistics and Transportation segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as transporting, storing, fractionating, terminaling, and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses. The Logistics and Transportation segment also includes Grand Prix, which connects our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our Downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The associated assets are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment and, except for pipelines and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.</p>
<p>Other contains the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. Elimination of inter-segment transactions are reflected in the corporate and eliminations column.</p>
<p>Reportable segment information is shown in the following tables:</p>

<h2>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</h2>
<p>The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("Annual Report"), as well as the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes hereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 ("Quarterly Report").</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation formed in October 2005. Targa is a leading provider of midstream services and is one of the largest independent midstream infrastructure companies in North America. We own, operate, acquire, and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary domestic midstream infrastructure assets.</p>
<h2>Our Operations</h2>
<p>We are engaged primarily in the business of:</p>
<ul>
<li>·gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas;</li>
<li>·transporting, storing, fractionating, treating, and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and</li>
<li>·gathering, storing, terminaling, and purchasing and selling crude oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide these services, we operate in two primary segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Transportation (also referred to as the Downstream Business).</p>
<p>Our Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering and/or purchase and sale of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells, removing impurities and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs; and assets used for the gathering and terminaling and/or purchase and sale of crude oil. The Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays); and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Our Logistics and Transportation segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as transporting, storing, fractionating, terminaling, and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses. The Logistics and Transportation segment also includes the Grand Prix NGL Pipeline ("Grand Prix"), which connects our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our Downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our Downstream facilities are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.</p>
<p>Other contains the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<p>In response to increasing production and to meet the infrastructure needs of producers and our downstream customers, our major expansion projects include the following:</p>
<h2>Permian Midland Processing Expansions</h2>
<ul>
<li>·In August 2023, we announced the construction of a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Permian Midland (the "Greenwood II plant"). The Greenwood II plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>·In May 2024, we announced the construction of a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Permian Midland (the "Pembrook II plant"). The Pembrook II plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Permian Delaware Processing Expansions</h2>
<ul>
<li>·In February 2023, we announced the transfer of an existing cryogenic natural gas processing plant acquired in the purchase of Southcross Energy Operating LLC and its subsidiaries to the Permian Delaware. The plant will be installed as a new 230 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the "Roadrunner II plant"). The Roadrunner II plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>·In August 2023, we announced the construction of a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Permian Delaware (the "Bull Moose plant"). The Bull Moose plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fractionation Expansion</h2>
<ul>
<li>·In August 2022, we announced plans to construct a new 120 MBbl/d fractionation train in Mont Belvieu, Texas ("Train 9"). Train 9 is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>·In January 2023, we reached an agreement with our partners in Gulf Coast Fractionators ("GCF") to reactivate GCF's 135 MBbl/d fractionation facility. The facility is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>·In May 2023, we announced plans to construct a new 120 MBbl/d fractionation train in Mont Belvieu, Texas ("Train 10"). Train 10 is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025.</li>
<li>·In May 2024, we announced plans to construct a new 150 MBbl/d fractionation train in Mont Belvieu, Texas ("Train 11"). Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h2>NGL Pipeline Expansion</h2>
<p>·In November 2022, we announced plans to construct a new NGL pipeline (the "Daytona NGL Pipeline") as an addition to our common carrier Grand Prix system. The pipeline will transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of Grand Prix in North Texas, where volumes will be transported to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Daytona NGL Pipeline is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Capital Allocation</h2>
<p>In April 2024, we declared an increase to our common dividend to $0.75 per common share, or $3.00 per common share annualized effective for the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>In May 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion common share repurchase program (the "2023 Share Repurchase Program"). For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased 1,186,444 shares of our common stock at a weighted average per share price of $104.26 for a total net cost of $123.7 million. As of March 31, 2024, there was $646.4 million remaining under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program and may discontinue the program at any time.</p>
<h2>Corporation Tax Matters</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") examinations are currently in process for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 taxable years of certain wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries that are treated as partnerships for U.S federal income tax purposes. We are responding to information requests from the IRS with respect to these audits. We are not aware of any potential audit findings that would give rise to adjustments to taxable income and do not anticipate material changes related to these audits.</p>
<p>Federal statutes of limitations for returns filed in 2020 (for calendar year 2019) have expired, except for the 2019 returns under examination that have a statute extension to April 2025. For Texas, the statute of limitations has expired for 2019 returns (for calendar year 2018). Similarly, the statute of limitations expired on substantially all 2019 state income tax returns that were filed prior to October 15, 2020. However, tax authorities could review and adjust carryover attributes (e.g., net operating losses) generated in a closed tax year if utilized in an open tax year.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us, see "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" included within Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<h2>How We Evaluate Our Operations</h2>
<p>The profitability of our business is a function of the difference between: (i) the revenues we receive from our operations, including fee-based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate we sell, and (ii) the costs associated with conducting our operations, including the costs of wellhead natural gas, crude oil and mixed NGLs that we purchase as well as operating, general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities. Because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs, increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability. Our contract portfolio, the prevailing pricing environment for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the impact of our commodity hedging program and its ability to mitigate exposure to commodity price movements, and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGL throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability. Our profitability is also affected by the NGL content in gathered wellhead natural gas, supply and demand for our products and services, utilization of our assets and changes in our customer mix.</p>
<p>Our profitability is also impacted by fee-based contracts. Our growing capital expenditures for pipelines and gathering and processing assets underpinned by fee-based margin, expansion of our Downstream facilities, continued focus on adding fee-based margin to our existing and future gathering and processing contracts, as well as third-party acquisitions of businesses and assets, will continue to increase the number of our contracts that are fee-based. Fixed fees for services such as gathering and processing, transportation, fractionation, storage, terminaling and crude oil gathering are not directly tied to changes in market prices for commodities. Nevertheless, a change in market dynamics such as available commodity throughput does affect profitability.</p>
<p>Management uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These include: (i) throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption, (ii) operating expenses, (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment).</p>
<h2>Throughput Volumes, Facility Efficiencies and Fuel Consumption</h2>
<p>Our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply and crude oil supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from oil and natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems. This is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production, as well as by capturing crude oil and natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties. Similarly, our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed NGL supply, connected by third-party transportation and Grand Prix, to our Downstream Business fractionation facilities and at times to our export facilities. We fractionate NGLs generated by our gathering and processing plants, as well as by contracting for mixed NGL supply from third-party facilities.</p>
<p>In addition, we seek to increase adjusted operating margin by limiting volume losses, reducing fuel consumption and by increasing efficiency. With our gathering systems' extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities, we monitor the volumes received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems, the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of NGLs and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants. We also monitor the volumes of NGLs received, stored, fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets. This information is tracked through our processing plants and Downstream Business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.</p>
<p>As part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations, we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss. We also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the NGLs and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of our facilities. Similar tracking is performed for our crude oil gathering and logistics assets and our NGL pipelines. These volume, recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis and safety programs.</p>
<h2>Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>Operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of specific assets. Labor, contract services, repair and maintenance and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These expenses remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems, but may increase with system expansions and inflation, and will fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period.</p>
<h2>Capital Expenditures</h2>
<p>Our capital expenditures are classified as growth capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures. Growth capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets, extend asset useful lives, increase capacities from existing levels, add capabilities, and reduce costs or enhance revenues. Maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of system components and equipment, which are worn, obsolete or completing their useful life and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Capital spending associated with growth and maintenance projects is closely monitored. Return on investment is analyzed before a capital project is approved, spending is closely monitored throughout the development of the project, and the subsequent operational performance is compared to the assumptions used in the economic analysis performed for the capital investment approval.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Measures</h2>
<p>We utilize non-GAAP measures to analyze our performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment) are non-GAAP measures. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are income (loss) from operations, Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. and segment operating margin. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because our non-GAAP measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect income and segment operating margin, and are defined differently by different companies within our industry, our definitions may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision-making processes.</p>
<h2>Adjusted Operating Margin</h2>
<p>We define adjusted operating margin for our segments as revenues less product purchases and fuel. It is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and commodity hedging program.</p>
<p>Gathering and Processing adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:</p>
<p>·service fees related to natural gas and crude oil gathering, treating and processing; and</p>
<p>·revenues from the sale of natural gas, condensate, crude oil and NGLs less producer settlements, fuel and transport and our equity volume hedge settlements.</p>
<p>Logistics and Transportation adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:</p>
<p>·service fees (including the pass-through of energy costs included in certain fee rates);</p>
<ul>
<li>·system product gains and losses; and</li>
<li>·NGL and natural gas sales, less NGL and natural gas purchases, fuel, third-party transportation costs and the net inventory change.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adjusted operating margin impacts of mark-to-market hedge unrealized changes in fair value are reported in Other.</p>
<p>Adjusted operating margin for our segments provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess:</p>
<p>·the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;</p>
<p>·our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and</p>
<p>·the viability of capital expenditure projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Management reviews adjusted operating margin and operating margin for our segments monthly as a core internal management process. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operating results. The reconciliation of our adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - By Reportable Segment."</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>We define adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that we believe should be adjusted consistent with our core operating performance. The adjusting items are detailed in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table and its footnotes. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and pay dividends to our investors.</p>
<p>Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow</p>
<p>We define adjusted cash flow from operations as adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense on debt obligations and cash tax (expense) benefit. We define adjusted free cash flow as adjusted cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs) and growth capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interest and contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are performance measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess our ability to generate cash earnings (after servicing our debt and funding capital expenditures) to be used for corporate purposes, such as payment of dividends, retirement of debt or redemption of other financing arrangements.</p>

<p>Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023</p>
<p>The decrease in commodity sales reflects lower natural gas and NGL prices ($589.0 million), the unfavorable impact of hedges ($258.4 million) and lower condensate volumes ($7.4 million), partially offset by higher NGL and natural gas volumes ($759.3 million) and higher condensate prices ($23.4 million).</p>
<p>The increase in fees from midstream services is primarily due to higher gas gathering and processing fees, and higher export volumes.</p>
<p>The increase in product purchases and fuel reflects higher NGL and natural gas volumes and higher condensate prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices.</p>
<p>The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher rental and labor costs as a result of increased activity and system expansions.</p>
<p>See "-Results of Operations-By Reportable Segment" for additional information on a segment basis.</p>
<p>The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the impact of system expansions on our asset base, partially offset by the shortening of depreciable lives of certain assets that were idled in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently shut down in the third quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The increase in interest expense, net, is due to recognition of cumulative interest on a 2024 legal ruling associated with the Splitter Agreement and higher borrowings, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest. See Note 12 - Contingencies for additional information related to the legal ruling.</p>
<p>The decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax book income.</p>
<p>The premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, net of tax is due to the acquisition of Blackstone Energy Partners' 25% interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture in 2023 (the "Grand Prix Transaction").</p>

<h2>Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023</h2>
<p>The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher natural gas inlet volumes and higher fees in the Permian, partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL prices. The increase in natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian was attributable to the addition of the Legacy II plant during the first quarter of 2023, the Midway plant during the second quarter of 2023, the Greenwood and Wildcat II plants during the fourth quarter of 2023, and continued strong producer activity. Natural gas inlet volumes in the Central region decreased primarily due to lower volumes in SouthTX and lower producer activity in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher volumes in the Permian and the addition of the Legacy II, Midway, Greenwood and Wildcat II plants.</p>

<p>Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023</p>
<p>The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher pipeline transportation and fractionation margin and higher LPG export margin, largely offset by lower marketing margin which benefited from greater seasonal optimization opportunities in the prior year. Pipeline transportation and fractionation volumes benefited from higher supply volumes primarily from our Permian Gathering and Processing systems and higher fees. LPG export margin increased due to higher volumes as the company benefited from the completion of its export expansion during the third quarter of 2023 and the Houston Ship Channel allowing night-time vessel transits.</p>
<p>The increase in operating expenses was due to higher system volumes, higher repairs and maintenance and higher compensation and benefits.</p>

<p>Other contains the results of commodity derivative activity mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our future commodity purchases and sales and natural gas transportation basis risk within our Logistics and Transportation segment. See further details of our risk management program in "Item 3. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."</p>
<h2>Our Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, inclusive of our consolidated joint venture accounts, we had $109.9 million of Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe our cash positions, our cash flows from operating activities, our free cash flow after dividends and remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facilities (discussed below in "Short-term Liquidity") are adequate to allow us to manage our day-to-day cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below. Our liquidity and capital resources are managed on a consolidated basis.</p>
<p>On a consolidated basis, our ability to finance our operations, including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, meeting our indebtedness obligations, refinancing or repaying our indebtedness, meeting our collateral requirements and to pay dividends declared by our Board of Directors will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These include commodity prices and ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. For additional discussion on recent factors impacting our liquidity and capital resources, please see "Recent Developments."</p>
<p>On a consolidated basis, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under the $2.75 billion TRGP senior revolving credit facility (the "TRGP Revolver"), unsecured commercial paper note program (the "Commercial Paper Program"), the Partnership's accounts receivable securitization facility (the "Securitization Facility"), and access to debt and equity capital markets. We supplement these sources of liquidity with joint venture arrangements and proceeds from asset sales. Our exposure to adverse credit conditions includes our credit facilities, cash investments, hedging abilities, customer performance risks and counterparty performance risks.</p>

<p>Other potential capital resources associated with our existing arrangements include our right to request an additional $500.0 million in commitment increases under the TRGP Revolver, subject to the terms therein. The TRGP Revolver matures on February 17, 2027.</p>
<p>A portion of our capital resources are allocated to letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements. As of March 31, 2024, we had $32.5 million in letters of credit outstanding under the TRGP Revolver. The letters of credit also reflect certain counterparties' views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations, as well as commodity prices and other factors.</p>
<h2>Working Capital</h2>
<p>Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. On a consolidated basis, at the end of any given month, accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced, with receivables from customers being offset by plant settlements payable to producers. The factors that typically cause overall variability in our reported total working capital are: (i) our cash position; (ii) liquids inventory levels, which we closely manage, as well as liquids valuations; (iii) changes in payables and accruals related to major growth capital projects; (iv) changes in the fair value of the current portion of derivative contracts; (v) monthly swings in borrowings under the Securitization Facility; and (vi) major structural changes in our asset base or business operations, such as certain organic growth capital projects and acquisitions or divestitures.</p>
<p>Working capital as of March 31, 2024 decreased $275.2 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower NGL inventory, higher product purchases and fuel payables due to higher NGL prices and volumes, reclassification of liabilities from long-term to current as a result of a 2024 legal ruling associated with the Splitter Agreement, and lower net liabilities for hedging activities, partially offset by lower net borrowings on the Securitization Facility.</p>
<p>Based on our anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, we believe that our internally generated cash flow, borrowings available under the TRGP Revolver, Commercial Paper Program, Securitization Facility, and proceeds from debt and equity offerings, as well as joint ventures and/or asset sales, should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, long-term debt obligations, collateral requirements and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next twelve months.</p>
<h2>Long-term Financing</h2>
<p>Our long-term financing consists of potentially raising funds through long-term debt obligations, the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or joint venture arrangements.</p>
<p>In the future, we or the Partnership may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our and/or the Partnership's outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases, exchanges or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.</p>
<p>To date, our debt balances and our subsidiaries' debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, ability to grow or ability to repay or refinance indebtedness.</p>
<p>For information about our debt obligations, see Note 6 - Debt Obligations to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For information about our interest rate risk, see "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk."</p>
<p>Compliance with Debt Covenants</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, both we and the Partnership were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.</p>

<p>The primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities are: (i) the collection of cash from customers from the sale of NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees for processing, gathering, export, fractionation, terminaling, storage and transportation; (ii) the payment of amounts related to the purchase of NGLs, natural gas and crude oil; (iii) changes in payables and accruals related to major growth capital projects; and (iv) the payment of other expenses, primarily field operating costs, general and administrative expense and interest expense. In addition, we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. Changes in the prices of the commodities we hedge impact our derivative settlements as well as our margin deposit requirements on unsettled futures contracts.</p>
<p>The decrease in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower collections from customers and lower settlements for hedge transactions, offset by a decrease in payments for product purchases and fuel.</p>

<p>The increase in total growth capital expenditures was primarily due to system expansions in the Permian region in response to forecasted production growth and higher activity levels, and expansions in our downstream business. The increase in total maintenance capital expenditures was primarily due to our growing infrastructure footprint.</p>
<p>With our announced natural gas processing additions currently under construction in the Permian region, coupled with the construction of our Daytona NGL Pipeline and Train 9, 10 and 11 fractionators in Mont Belvieu, we currently estimate that in 2024 we will invest between $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in net growth capital expenditures for announced projects. Future growth capital expenditures may vary based on investment opportunities. We expect that 2024 maintenance capital expenditures, net of noncontrolling interests, will be approximately $225 million.</p>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, there were $87.1 million in surety bonds outstanding related to various performance obligations. These are in place to support various performance obligations as required by (i) statutes within the regulatory jurisdictions where we operate, and (ii) counterparty support. Obligations under these surety bonds are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.</h2>
<p>Our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices, particularly to the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, changes in interest rates, as well as nonperformance by our risk management counterparties and customers.</p>
<h2>Risk Management</h2>
<p>We evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit. All of our commodity derivatives are with major financial institutions or major energy companies. Should any of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We sell our natural gas, NGLs and condensate to a variety of purchasers. Non-performance by a trade creditor could result in losses.</p>
<p>Crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk through 2027. Market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts.</p>
<h2>Commodity Price Risk</h2>
<p>A portion of our revenues are derived from percent-of-proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of commodities as payment for services. The prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. We monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business. Cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge some of the exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, as of March 31, 2024, we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from our percentof-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. We hedge a higher percentage of our expected equity volumes in the current year compared to future years, for which we hedge incrementally lower percentages of expected equity volumes. We also enter into commodity financial instruments to help manage other short-term commodity-related business risks of our ongoing operations and in conjunction with marketing opportunities available to us in the operations of our logistics and transportation assets. With swaps, we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of commodities and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices. Since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity, these transactions are designed to effectively lock-in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged. In order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes, we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected equity volumes. We utilize purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. We may buy calls in connection with swap positions to create a price floor with upside. We intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions using swaps, collars, purchased puts (or floors), futures or other derivative instruments as market conditions permit.</p>
<p>When entering into new hedges, we intend to generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes. The NGL hedges cover specific NGL products based upon the expected equity NGL composition. We believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as "proxy" hedges of NGL prices. The fair values of our natural gas and NGL hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at various locations, which closely approximate the actual natural gas and NGL delivery points. A portion of our condensate sales are hedged using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude.</p>
<p>A majority of these commodity price hedges are documented pursuant to a standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") form with customized credit and legal terms. The principal counterparties (or, if applicable, their guarantors) have investment grade credit ratings. While we have no current obligation to post cash, letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges so long as we maintain our current credit rating, we could be obligated to post collateral to secure the hedges in the event of an adverse change in our creditworthiness where a counterparty's exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices. A purchased put (or floor) transaction does not expose our counterparties to credit risk, as we have no obligation to make future payments beyond the premium paid to enter into the transaction; however, we are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparty, which is the risk that the counterparty will not honor its obligation under the put transaction.</p>
<p>We also enter into commodity price hedging transactions using futures contracts on futures exchanges. Exchange traded futures are subject to exchange margin requirements, so we may have to increase our cash deposit due to a rise in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices. Unlike bilateral hedges, we are not subject to counterparty credit risks when using futures on futures exchanges.</p>
<p>These contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Generally, our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set. If prices rise above the prices at which they have been hedged, we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges (other than with respect to purchased calls).</p>
<p>To analyze the risk associated with our derivative instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the change in fair value of our derivative instruments based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity prices, but does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the related hedged items. The financial statement impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in commodity price would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged item under hedge accounting. The fair values of our derivative instruments are also influenced by changes in market volatility for option contracts and the discount rates used to determine the present values.</p>
<p>The following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments as of March 31, 2024:</p>

<p>The table above contains all derivative instruments outstanding as of the stated date for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk, which we are exposed to due to our equity volumes and future commodity purchases and sales, as well as basis differentials related to our gas transportation arrangements.</p>
<p>Our operating revenues increased (decreased) by $(35.1) million and $223.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of transactions accounted for as derivatives. The estimated fair value of our risk management position has moved from a net asset position of $74.4 million at December 31, 2023 to a net liability position of $26.9 million at March 31, 2024. Forward commodity prices have increased relative to the fixed prices on our derivative contracts creating the net liability position.</p>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>We are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under the TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program, the Securitization Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. As of March 31, 2024, we do not have any interest rate hedges. However, we may enter into interest rate hedges in the future with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. To the extent that interest rates increase, interest expense for the TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program, the Securitization Facility and the Term Loan Facility will also increase. As of March 31, 2024, we had $1.4 billion in outstanding variable rate borrowings. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the rate of our variable interest rate debt would impact our consolidated annual interest expense by $13.6 million based on our March 31, 2024 debt balances.</p>
<h2>Counterparty Credit Risk</h2>
<p>We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. The credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of the asset position (i.e. the fair value of expected future receipts) at the reporting date. Our futures contracts have limited credit risk since they are cleared through an exchange and are margined daily. Should the creditworthiness of one or more of the counterparties decline, our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party. In the event of a counterparty default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted. We have master netting provisions in the ISDA agreements with our derivative counterparties. These netting provisions allow us to net settle asset and liability positions with the same counterparties within the same Targa entity, and would reduce our maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk by $35.2 million as of March 31, 2024. The range of losses attributable to our individual counterparties as of March 31, 2024 would be between $0.1 million and $7.3 million, depending on the counterparty in default.</p>
<p>For more information about our hedging activities, see Note 10 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<h2>Customer Credit Risk</h2>
<p>We extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business. We have established various procedures to manage our credit exposure, including performing initial and subsequent credit risk analyses, setting maximum credit limits and terms and requiring credit enhancements when necessary. We use credit enhancements including (but not limited to) letters of credit, prepayments, parental guarantees and rights of offset to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria are followed and financial loss is mitigated or minimized.</p>
<p>We have an active credit management process, which is focused on controlling loss exposure due to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties. Our allowance for credit losses was $2.5 million as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, no customer comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated revenues.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered in this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>On December 26, 2018, Vitol Americas Corp. ("Vitol") filed a lawsuit in the 80th District Court of Harris County (the "District Court"), Texas against Targa Channelview LLC, then a subsidiary of the Company ("Targa Channelview"), seeking recovery of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview, additional monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Vitol alleged that Targa Channelview breached an agreement, dated December 27, 2015, for crude oil and condensate between Targa Channelview and Noble Americas Corp. (the "Splitter Agreement"), which provided for Targa Channelview to construct a crude oil and condensate splitter (the "Splitter") adjacent to a barge dock owned by Targa Channelview to provide services contemplated by the Splitter Agreement. In January 2018, Vitol acquired Noble Americas Corp. and on December 23, 2018, Vitol voluntarily elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement claiming that Targa Channelview failed to timely achieve start-up of the Splitter. Vitol's lawsuit also alleged Targa Channelview made a series of misrepresentations about the capability of the barge dock that would service crude oil and condensate volumes to be processed by the Splitter and Splitter products. Vitol sought return of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview prior to the start-up of the Splitter, as well as additional damages. On the same date that Vitol filed its lawsuit, Targa Channelview filed a lawsuit against Vitol seeking a judicial determination that Vitol's sole and exclusive remedy was Vitol's voluntarily termination of the Splitter Agreement and, as a result, Vitol was not entitled to the return of any prior payments under the Splitter Agreement or other damages as alleged. Targa also sought recovery of its attorneys' fees and costs in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2020, the District Court awarded Vitol $129.0 million (plus interest) following a bench trial. In addition, the District Court awarded Vitol $10.5 million in damages for losses and demurrage on crude oil that Vitol purchased for start-up efforts. The Company appealed the award in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas. In October 2020, we sold Targa Channelview, but under the agreements governing the sale, we retained the liabilities associated with the Vitol proceedings. On September 13, 2022, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's judgment in part with regard to the return of Vitol's prior payments, but modified the judgment to delete Vitol's ability to recover any damages related to losses or demurrage on crude oil. We filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on October 20, 2023. We then filed a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on April 19, 2024. The cumulative amount of interest on the award through March 31, 2024 was $54.9 million.</p>
