Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Programs utilizing General Education products and services are for students that are not specializing in any particular curriculum or course of study. These programs provide an alternative to traditional "brick-and-mortar" school options and address a range of student needs including, safety concerns, increased academic support, scheduling flexibility,

physical/health restrictions or advanced learning. Products and services are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte.

Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, indemand industries-including information technology, health care and business. Through our Career Learning programs, we offer middle and high school students content pathways that include job-ready skills and work experiences and, for high school students, that can lead toward an industry certification and/or college credits. Like General Education product and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. Through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts brands, we also offer in-person and remote immersive programs and self-paced, structured online Career Learning programs to adult learners in da ta science, software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers. These programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies.

For both the General Education and Career Learning markets, the majority of revenue is derived from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which includes an integrated package of curriculum, technology systems, instruction, and support services that we administer on behalf of our customers. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a negotiated time frame. During any fiscal year, we may enter into new agreements, receive non-automatic renewal notices, negotiate replacement agreements, terminate such agreements or receive notices of termination, or customers may transition a school to a different offering.

## Our History

We were founded in 2000 to utilize advances in technology to provide children with access to a high-quality education regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic background. Given the geographic flexibility of technology-based education, we believed we could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality and breadth of available curriculum and instruction, both in the United States and abroad. The convergence of these factors and rapid advances in Internet networks created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying online learning software and systems on a flexible, online platform.

In September 2001, we introduced our kindergarten through 2 nd grade offering in Pennsylvania and Colorado, serving approximately 900 students in the two states combined. We subsequently added new grades and new schools in additional states. We also launched blended public schools that combine face-to-face time in the classroom with online instruction and opened an online private school to reach students worldwide. For the 2020-2021 school year, we provided our school-as-a-service offering to 77 schools in 30 states and the District of Columbia in the General Education market, and 33 schools in 23 states in the Career Learning market. We also serve schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our Learning Solutions sales channel.

In January 2020, we acquired Galvanize toex pand the Company's adult learning offerings to include data science and software engineering, technology staffing and developing talent and capabilities for companies. In November 2020, we acquired Tech Elevator and MedCerts to continue our expansion into adult learning. Tech Elevator provides in-person and remote immersive training in software development for consumers and enterprises. MedCerts offers online allied healthcare training, including certification preparation and job placement support.

## Our Market

The U.S. market for K-12 education is large and virtual and blended learning has gained greater acceptance and broader usage due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example:

- ● According to a May 2019 report of the National Education Policy Center ("NEPC") entitled "Full-Time Virtual and Blended Schools: Enrollment, Student Characteristics, and Performance," in 2017-18, 501 full-time virtual schools enrolled 297,712 students, and 300 blended schools enrolled 132,960. The NEPC report further states thirty-nine states had either virtual or blended schools. There were four states that allowed blended schools to operate but still have not allowed the opening of full-time virtual schools. A total of six states have full-time virtual schools but do not currently have full-time blended learning schools.

## Table of Contents

- ● In an April 2021 study of 16 to 18 year old students in the U.S. and U.K., the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics found that one-third of students would choose either full-time or part-time online education even after things return to normal after the pandemic. This included 29% of students who preferred a hybrid approach, and 4% of students who preferred a full-time virtual education.
- ● In 2020, the National Home Education Research Institute reported that there are approximately 2.5 million homeeducated students in the United States, which has grown by an estimated 2% per year since 2016.

## Demand for Education Alternatives: The Market Opportunity

As evidenced by the rapid evolution of education technology and varying educational options being offered to learners of all ages, no single learning model has been found that works equally well for every student. Learners today utilize technology in all aspects of their lives, and we expect this reality to extend to their education. Our business has been built on the premise that every learner, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic background, is entitled to a high-quality education that is individualized and adaptable based on the student's unique needs. We also believe all learners can benefit from more engaging technology-enriched educational content.

We anticipate that full-time online public schools will meet the needs of a small percentage of the overall United States K12 student population, but that segment will still represent a large and growing opportunity for us in absolute terms. Across our educational programs, learners come from a broad range of social, economic and academic backgrounds. Examples of students for whom our full-time virtual or blended solutions may fit include, but are not limited to, families with: (i) students seeking to learn in a way that better accommodates their individual needs; (ii) safety, social and health concerns about their local school, including students who are being bullied or are subjected to discrimination; (iii) students with disabilities who are seeking alternatives to traditional classrooms; (iv) students for whom the local public school is not meeting their needs; (v) students who seek or need greater flexibility than other alternatives, such as student-athletes and performers who are not able to attend regularly scheduled classes; (vi) college-bound students who want to bolster their college readiness and application appeal by taking additional Advanced Placement ("AP"), honors and/or elective courses; (vii) students seeking career and technical skills; (viii) high school dropouts who have decided to re-enroll in school to earn a diploma; and (ix) students of military families who desire high-quality, consistent education as they relocate to new locations. Our individualized learning approach allows students to optimize their educational experience and, therefore, their chances of achieving their goals.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way in which students were educated during the 2020-21 school year, we continue to expect most students in the United States will be educated in traditional school buildings and classrooms. However, we believe that certain student segments will benefit from the availability to choose an online public education (including blended learning models), and that states and districts will seek to incorporate virtual and blended solutions into their school-based programs. Our school-as-a-service offering offers a full service, integrated program, and a complete solution for districts and schools that desire a comprehensive option. For public school customers who need less than a full service offering, our Learning Solutions sales channel provides online curriculum and services on a solutions-oriented, customized basis. We continue to invest significant resources, organically and through licensing or acquisitions, in developing product offerings that afford us the flexibility to serve different types of customers with varying value propositions and price points that are adaptable to an institution's and individuals' capabilities and needs. Moreover, we have pursued, and will continue to pursue, selected markets outside the United States where we believe our products and services can address local foreign market needs.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that demand for occupations that require nondegree postsecondary education will grow at almost twice the rate of overall employment through 2029. We believe this will drive more adult learners to seek training solutions that lead to credentials or certifications. It is anticipated that these learners will seek lower cost, more accessible training solutions that prepare them for the workforce in less time than traditional post-secondary degree programs. Our adult learning solutions provide these types of learners with content, instruction, and career placement services to help them achieve their career goals. Additionally, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, recruiting and hiring remains one of the top challenges for companies. To address this challenge, companies are beginning to cover the cost of training for entry-level positions as well as increasing budgets for upskilling and reskilling of their existing workforce. Stride's adult learning solutions addresses these employer needs by providing training and job placement and recruitment services. We anticipate that this market will continue to grow as more employers recognize the benefits of retaining existing talent rather than sourcing new talent.

## General Education

Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Programs utilizing General Education products and services are for students that are not specializing in any particular curriculum or course of study. These programs provide an alternative to traditional school options and address a range of student needs including, safety concerns, increased academic support, scheduling flexibility, physical/health restrictions or advanced learning. Products and services are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte.

## Career Learning

Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, indemand industries-including information technology, health care and business. We provide middle and high school students with Career Learning programs that complement their core general education coursework in math, English, science and history. Stride offers multiple career pathways supported by a diverse catalog of Career Learning courses. The middle school program exposes students to a variety of career options and introduces career skill development. In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work-based learning experiences that are required to succeed in today's digital, tech-enabled economy. A student enrolled in a school offering Stride's General Education program may take Career Learning courses, but that student and the associated revenue is not reported as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue. However, a student and the associated revenue, whether in middle or high school, is counted as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue if the student is enrolled in a Career Learning program.

Like General Education products and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. We also offer focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts brands. These include skills training for the data science, software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers. Thes e programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies.

## Our Sales Channels

## Virtual and Blended Schools

The Virtual and Blended Public Schools we serve offer an integrated package of systems, services, products, and professional expertise that we administer to support a virtual or blended public school. Customers of these programs can obtain the administrative support, information technology, academic support services, online curriculum, learning system platforms and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service and product agreement. We provide our school-as-a-service offerings to virtual and blended public charter schools and school districts. These contracts are negotiated with, and approved by, the governing authorities of the customer. The duration of these service and product agreements are typically greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a negotiated time frame. During any fiscal year, the Company may enter into new agreements, receive non-automatic renewal notices, negotiate replacement agreements, terminate such agreements or receive notice of termination, or customers may transition a school to a different offering. The governing boards may also establish school policies and other terms and conditions over the course of a contract, such as enrollment parameters. The authorizers who issue the charters to our school-as-a-service customers can renew, revoke, or modify those charters as well.

The majority of our revenue is derived from these school-as-a-service agreements with the governing authorities of the public schools we serve. In addition to providing a comprehensive course catalog, related books and physical materials, a learning management system for online learning, and, in certain cases, student computers, we also offer these schools a variety of administrative support, technology and academic support services. Full-time virtual and blended public school students access online lessons over the Internet and utilize offline learning materials we provide. Students receive assignments, complete lessons, take assessments, and are instructed by teachers with whom they interact via email,

telephonically, in synchronous virtual classroom environments, and sometimes face-to-face. In either case, for parents who believe their child is not thriving in their current school or for students and families who require time or location flexibility in their schooling, virtual and blended public schools can provide a compelling choice. Students attending many of these schools are also provided the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of school activities, including field trips, service learning opportunities, honor societies, and clubs. In addition to school-level activities, we sponsor a wide variety of extracurricular activities on a national basis, such as clubs, contests and college and career planning sessions.

These virtual public schools operate under different brands including Virtual Academies (our General Education offering), Stride Career Prep (including Destinations Career Academies, which focus on career pathways), Insight schools (which tend to focus on particular student segments, such as only middle and high school grade levels, at-risk students and career readiness programs), and iQ Academies (where responsibility for academic program and regulatory compliance rests with the school or school district).

In addition to our full-time virtual public schools, we offer a variety of support services and sell our products to blended public schools, which are public schools that combine online and face-to-face instruction for students in a variety of ways with varying amounts of time spent by students in a physical learning center. In contrast to a typical brick and mortar public school, blended public schools can provide a greater selection of available courses, increased opportunities for self-paced, individualized instruction and greater scheduling flexibility. Our blended schools bring students and teachers physically together more often than a purely online program. In some blended schools we support, students attend a learning center on a part-time basis, where they receive face-to-face instruction, in addition to their online virtual curriculum and instruction.

## Learning Solutions

Our Learning Solutions sales channel distributes our software and services to schools and school districts across the U.S. Over the past few years, public schools and school districts have been increasingly adopting online solutions to augment teaching practices, launch new learning models, cost-effectively expand course offerings, provide schedule flexibility, improve student engagement, increase graduation rates, replace textbooks, and retain students. State education funds traditionally allocated for textbook and print materials have also been authorized for the purchase of digital content, including online courses, and in some cases mandated access to online courses. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, school districts are seeking more complete virtual learning solutions in addition to curriculum, including virtual instructional delivery, scheduling, attendance monitoring for virtual instructional sessions, teacher professional development, consulting support in effective virtual instruction, and special education accommodations. Additionally, districts are seeking support for implementations that blend virtual and in-person instruction.

To address the growing need for digital solutions and the recently emerging need for comprehensive virtual solutions, our Learning Solutions team provides curriculum and technology solutions, packaged in a portfolio of flexible learning and delivery models mapped to specific student and/or district needs. This portfolio approach provides a continuum of delivery models, from fulltime programs to individual course sales and supplemental options that can be used in traditional classrooms to differentiate instruction. Our Learning Solutions team strives to partner with public schools and school districts, primarily in the U.S., to provide more options and better tools to empower teachers to improve student achievement through personalized learning in traditional, blended and online learning environments and to provide comprehensive support for teachers and administrators to deliver effective virtual and blended instructions.

## Private Pay

We own and operate three accredited, tuition-based private schools that meet a range of student needs from individual course credit recovery to college preparatory programs. Beyond our business in the United States, we pursue international opportunities where we believe there is significant demand for a quality online education. Our international customers are typically expatriate families who wish to study in English and foreign students who desire a U.S. high school diploma. For the 2020-21 school year, we served students in more than 100 countries. In addition, we have entered into agreements that enable us to distribute our products and services to our international school partners who use our courses to provide broad elective offerings and dual diploma programs.

## Table of Contents

## Consumer Sales

We also sell individual K-8 online courses and supplemental educational products directly to families. These purchasers desire to educate their children as homeschoolers, outside of the traditional school system or to supplement their child's existing public or private school education without the aid of an online teacher. Customers of our consumer products have the option of purchasing a complete grade-level curriculum for grades K-8, individual courses, or a variety of other supplemental products, covering various subjects depending on their child's needs. Typical applications include summer school course work, home-schooling and educational supplements.

## Adult Learning

We offer adult learning training programs through three brands, Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts, which provide programs that address the skills gap facing companies in the information technology and health care sectors. Galvanize and Tech Elevator offer in-person and remote immersive full-time programs designed for adult learners looking to advance their technology careers by providing such learners with skills and real-world experiences. These programs are offered in software engineering and data science. MedCerts provides self-paced, fully online structured training programs that lead to certifications in the health care field. In many cases, Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts work directly with a company to create a customized, tailored education plan to help the company reach its goals and train its employees according to such plan.

## Our Business Strategy

We are committed to maximizing every learner's potential by personalizing their educational experience, delivering a quality education to schools and students, and supporting our customers in their quest to improve academic outcomes and prepare them for college and future careers. In furtherance of those objectives, we plan to continue investing in our curriculum and learning systems. These investments include initiatives to create and deploy a next generation curriculum and learning platform, improve the effectiveness of our school workforce, develop new instructional approaches to increase student and parental engagement, and improve our systems and security architecture. This strategy consists of the following key elements:

Affect Better Student Outcomes. We are committed to improving student outcomes for every student in the schools we serve. To achieve this goal we: (i) invest in training and professional development for teachers and school leaders, which may include a competency-based Master's Graduate Degree in Online Teaching K-12 though our partnership with Southern New Hampshire University; (ii) develop programs and initiatives designed to improve the learning experience, such as our interactive media projects, project-based learning ("PBL"), virtual science labs and AP test prep; (iii) enhance our curriculum to make it more engaging, adaptive and available to all students anywhere; and (iv) update our content as state standards and state assessments change. We also will focus our marketing and enrollment efforts on helping students and families understand the unique demands and challenges of the online learning environment. We believe better understanding by parents and students will better prepare students for the work and improve their chance at academic success.

Improve Student Retention in Our School-as-a-Service Offerings. To ensure the best outcomes for students, we have partnered with the school boards we serve to make a concerted effort to enroll and retain students who are truly engaged and ready to learn. Research shows that students who remain in the same school setting longer generally perform better academically, and retention is especially challenging with virtual and blended schools because families have the option of enrolling their children in a brick and mortar school or another virtual or blended school. We, therefore, continue to refine our marketing programs to attract students who are most likely to succeed in a non-classroom based environment with the expectation of increasing academic success and student retention, recognizing that all students are eligible to enroll consistent with state requirements (e.g., enrollment caps, prior public school student). Once students are enrolled, programs such as Strong Start Onboarding, Single Point of Contact Advisors, Social-Emotional Learning and Face-to-Face/Blended Programs provide early intervention and focused engagement and retention strategies, which strive to help students stay on track, improve engagement and, ultimately, give students a better chance at academic success.

Grow Career Learning Enrollments and Expand Career Training Market. To grow Stride's Career Learning business and enrollments we are expanding the Stride Career Prep brand, introducing PBL and pursuing industry partnerships. We believe this approach will be more advanced than traditional vocational training and broader than enrollment in a series of career technical education ("CTE") courses. We seek to expand our addressable market by

## Table of Contents

offering career readiness training beyond our traditional K-12 market and into adult education and corporate training. In calendar year 2020, we acquired three adult learning businesses, Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts, to expand into the information technology and health care industries to provide talent development for individuals and enterprises.

Introduce New and Improved Products and Services. We intend to continue to expand our product line and offerings, both internally and through licensing or strategic acquisitions of products that expand our current portfolio. This includes pursuing development and licensing of curriculum and platforms that are accessible from tablet and mobile devices and leveraging adaptive learning technologies and solutions.

Increase Enrollments at Existing Virtual and Blended Public Schools . Some state regulations, school governing authorities and/or districts limit or cap student enrollment or enrollment growth. At the direction of our school board and school district customers, we seek to provide an opportunity for more students to attend these schools, and support their efforts to work with legislators, state departments of education, educators and parents to increase or remove student enrollment caps.

Expand Virtual and Blended Public School Presence into Additional States and Cities. As laws change and opportunities arise, we work with states, school districts, regional education organizations, and charter schools to authorize and establish new virtual and blended public schools and to contract with them to provide our curriculum, online learning platform, support services, and other related offerings. Traditional school districts are becoming a greater percentage of our customer base.

Grow Our Learning Solutions Sales Channel. Our broad Learning Solutions course catalog ranges from pre-K to 12th grade, instructional services, supplemental solutions, and teacher development and is the key driver for Learning Solutions growth. We work to continue the market adoption of these solutions and services as school districts partner with us to address a variety of academic needs and to facilitate personalized learning in traditional, blended and online learning environments.

Add Enrollments in Our Private Schools. We currently operate three online private schools that we believe appeal to a broad range of students and families. We look to drive increased enrollments in these schools by increasing awareness, through targeted marketing programs, and by solicitation of partnerships with traditional brick and mortar private schools.

Pursue International Opportunities to Offer Our Learning Systems. We believe there is strong worldwide demand for high-quality, online education from U.S. families living abroad, foreign students who seek a U.S.-style education, and the schools and school systems that serve such students in their local market. Our ability to operate virtually is not constrained by the need for a physical classroom or local teachers, which makes our learning systems ideal for use internationally.

Develop Additional Channels through which to Deliver Our Learning Systems. We plan to evaluate other delivery channels on a routine basis and to pursue opportunities where we believe there is likely to be significant demand for our offering, such as direct classroom instruction, blended classroom models, career technical education, supplemental educational products, adult learning, and individual products packaged and sold directly to consumers. We have made strategic investments in other companies to supplement our Learning Solutions go-to-market approach with a focus on advising school districts on their digital classroom transformation efforts.

Pursue Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions. We may pursue selective acquisitions that complement our existing educational offerings and business capabilities, and that are natural extensions of our core competencies. We may also pursue acquisitions that extend our offerings and business capabilities, such as our acquisitions of Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts in calendar year 2020, and opportunities with institutions. We believe we can be a valued-added partner or contribute our expertise in curriculum development and educational services to serve more students. In 2018, we partnered with Southern New Hampshire University to invest in the development of degree-granting programs for online teaching.

## Products and Services

We continue to invest in curriculum and technology to educate students more effectively and efficiently. Much of our investment has been in the development of improved functionality of our curriculum and systems. Areas of focus include: (i) integration and user experience-making sure that all of our systems and solutions are easy for teachers,

administrators, students, and parents to use; (ii) mobile enabled products; (iii) portability-making sure that our platforms integrate with and onto third-party platforms; (iv) features which personalize learning for all students we serve; (v) courses that are flexible enough to provide assistance to struggling students; (vi) reading and oral fluency scoring; (vii) alignment with state standards; (viii) built-in tutoring and support functionality; and (ix) a virtual learning platform which supports the scheduling and delivery of instruction, tracking of attendance, recording of instructional sessions, and allows student group work.

We provide various products and services to customers on an individual basis as well as customized solutions, including our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which supports our customers in operating full-time virtual or blended schools. We continue to expand upon our personalized learning model, improve the user experience of our products, and develop tools and partnerships to more effectively engage and serve students, teachers, administrators, and adult learners.

## Curriculum and Content

Our customers can select from hundreds of high-quality, engaging, online coursework and content, as well as many statecustomized versions of those courses, electives, and instructional supports. We have built core courses with the guidance and recommendations of leading educational organizations at the national and state levels. State standards continue to evolve, and we invest in our curriculum to meet these changing requirements.

Adult Learning - Through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts brands, we have added high-quality, engaging, online coursework and content in information technology and health care.

## Systems

We have established a secure and reliable technology platform, which integrates proprietary and third-party systems to provide a high-quality educational environment and give us the capability to grow our customer programs and enrollment. Our endto-end platform includes content management, learning management, student information, data reporting and analytics, and various support systems that allow customers to provide a high-quality, and personalized educational experience for students. À la carte offerings can provide curriculum and content hosting on customers' learning management systems, or integrate with customers' student information systems.

## Instructional Services

We offer a broad range of instructional services that include customer support for instructional teams, including recruitment of state certified teachers, training in research-based online instruction methods and systems, oversight and evaluation services, and ongoing professional development. Stride also provides training options to support teachers and parents to meet students' learning needs. Our range of training options are designed to enhance skills needed to teach using an online learning platform, and include hands-on training, on-demand courses, and support materials.

## Support Services

We offer a broad range of support services, including marketing and enrollment (e.g., supporting prospective students through the admission process), assessment management, administrative support (e.g., budget proposals, financial reporting, and student data reporting), and technology and materials support (e.g., providing student computers, offline learning kits, internet access and technology support services).

## Accreditation and Academic Performance

In 2018, Cognia renewed our corporate accreditation for another five years. Cognia (formerly known as AdvancED) is a non-profit organization that serves more than 30,000 public and private schools and districts across the United States. It was created by the merger of the preK-12 divisions of the North Central Accreditation Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement, and the subsequent addition of the Northwest Accreditation Commission.

Our fundamental goal for every child who enrolls in a school that has purchased our school-as-a-service offering, is to improve their academic performance. With the implementation of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act ("ESSA")

## Table of Contents

for the 2017-18 school year, each of the states in which we support virtual and blended public schools has been given the authority to develop a school accountability plan within the confines of a broad federal ESSA framework based on their own conception of the best means to advance college and career readiness. The ESSA requires states to utilize four academic-related indicators in their accountability plans to measure school and student performance: academic achievement, student growth in reading and math, graduation rate, and progress in achieving English language proficiency. The states were given discretion on the weight to give to each indicator and how to apply them. Most of the state ESSA plans submitted in 2017 to the U.S. Department of Education use some form of summative rating method to describe school performance, such as conferring an A-F grade or using a ranking system having a 1-10 scale. A significant new element of this education law is a requirement for states to adopt at least one non-academic indicator in their state's accountability system to measure "school quality or student success," often called the "fifth" indicator. Unlike No Child Left Behind where the only measure of school performance was an Annual Yearly Progress report, there are a wide range of nonacademic options enumerated in the ESSA that the states can adopt to advance their own "school quality or student success" accountability objectives. The states may include measures of student engagement, educator engagement, student access to and completion of advanced coursework, post-secondary readiness, school climate and safety, and any other indicator a state may choose for this purpose. For example, a post-secondary readiness accountability indicator can include student participation in and completion of a CTE program of study, or access to dual credit programs. Similarly, a student engagement indicator may focus on teacher observations or ratings that demonstrate improvements in this area.

We share the view taken by many states that assessing a student by his or her learning growth is a more accurate indicator of school and student performance than attaining a static proficiency score. This approach is now reflected in the ESSA as well. All of our school-as-a-service offerings administer nationally recognized, norm-referenced assessments to measure student growth during the school year, to prepare students for state assessments and to guide instruction. To ensure all schools are utilizing best practices learned from other successful school clients and from other high performing schools across the country, we continue to encourage the school boards of our customers to implement our Academic Excellence Framework, a standardized guide available to all of our school-as-a-service clients that addresses teacher preparation, delivery of instruction, and student assessment. Effective instruction is informed by and evaluated based on student-level data. As part of the academic framework guidelines, schools implement plans to collect student-level data throughout the year through the use of norm-referenced growth measures at least three times per year, along with strategically placed formative interims, benchmarks, and summative assessments.

In addition to the complexities involved in measuring academic performance of students, we believe that the virtual and blended public schools we serve face unique challenges impacting academic success not necessarily encountered to the same extent by traditional brick and mortar schools. These challenges include students who enter behind grade level or under-credited, high student mobility, lack of control over the student learning environment and higher than average percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch in many states. With rare exceptions, the data shows that students identified as eligible for free lunch had lower percentages at or above proficiency levels than students eligible for reduced-price lunch, and both groups usually underperformed students identified as not eligible for subsidized meals. In addition, for decades, educational research has shown that persistence-remaining and proceeding at pace in the same school setting-can benefit academic performance, while mobilitymoving from one school setting to another-can have a destabilizing influence, causing students to struggle and lapse in academic performance.

While measuring academic performance is necessary, taking meaningful steps to improve student outcomes is an integral part of our mission. Accordingly, we continually strive to achieve that objective by undertaking new initiatives and improving existing programs that support students and families, such as Strong Start, Social-Emotional Learning and Advisors. To monitor student learning progress during the school year, we are using multiple equivalent assessments at the lesson, unit and semester level. This is intended to ensure that our measurement is reliable and valid. We provide more synchronous sessions for at-risk students based on data driven instruction that provides for targeted teacher intervention to assist students with lesson challenges.

In furtherance of our goal to improve academic performance, the Academic Committee of the Stride Board of Directors is charged with making recommendations to management to foster continuous improvement in academic outcomes for the public and private schools served by the Company. With input and oversight from the Academic Committee, our Educational Advisory Committee ("EAC") consists of industry experts who provide additional academic expertise and advice. The EAC met five times in fiscal year 2021. The members of the EAC were:

- ● Dr. David Driscoll, former Commissioner of Education, Commonwealth of Massachusetts;

## Table of Contents

- ● Ms. Millie Fornell, former Chief of Staff, Miami-Dade School District;
- ● Ms. Ann Foster, former Senior Vice President Strategy, Business Development and Connected Learning for Harcourt Education Group;
- ● Dr. Mary Futrell, retired Dean of the George Washington University School of Education and former President of the National Education Association;
- ● Dr. Beverly Hutton, Deputy Executive Director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals;
- ● Dr. Ildiko Laczko-Kerr, Chief Academic Officer, Arizona Charter Schools Association;
- ● Dr. Andrew Porter, former Dean of the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania; and
- ● Dr. Elanna Yalow, CEO of Knowledge Universe Early Learning Programs.

## Competition

As a general matter, we face varying degrees of competition from a variety of education companies because the scope of our offerings and the customers we serve encompass many separate and distinct segments of the education business. We compete primarily with companies that provide online curriculum and school support services to K-12 virtual and blended public schools and school districts, including those with a career orientation. These companies include Pearson PLC (Connections Academy), Lincoln Learning Solutions, StrongMind, Pansophic Learning, Inspire Charter Schools, and Charter Schools USA, and state-administered online programs, among others. We also face competition from digital and print curriculum developers. The digital curriculum providers include Apex Learning Inc., Curriculum Associates, Achieve 3000, Weld North LLC, Edmentum Inc., Renaissance Learning, Inc., and traditional textbook publishers such as Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and McGraw Hill. Other competing digital curriculum providers, including Khan Academy, Duolingo, IXL Learning, Inc. and LearnZillion, Inc., offer a different pricing model which provides curriculum at a lower cost (sometimes free) but may charge for additional products or services. We also compete with institutions such as The Laurel Springs School (Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.) and Penn Foster Inc. for online private pay school students. Additionally, our Adult Learning offerings compete with other in-person and remote immersive programs and self-paced online training programs. These include General Assembly (a subsidiary of Adecco), Lambda School (Lambda Inc.), and Education to Go (a subsidiary of Cengage Learning), among others.

We believe that the primary factors on which we compete are:

- ● extensive experience in, and understanding of, virtual education delivery;
- ● comprehensive suite of academic programs;
- ● customer satisfaction with our curriculum, school teachers and the schools we serve;
- ● quality of integrated curriculum and materials with an online delivery platform;
- ● qualifications, experience and training teachers for online instruction;
- ● comprehensiveness of school management and student support services;
- ● integrated K-12 solutions, with components designed and built to work together;
- ● ability to leverage our assets across our business; and
- ● sophisticated government affairs knowledge and experience in virtual and blended school regulatory environments.

## Table of Contents

Broadly speaking, we participate in the market for digital education and adult training. In states where we enter into multiyear service and product agreements with virtual and blended public schools, we believe that we generally serve less than 1% of the public school students in that state. The customers for Learning Solutions sales are schools and school districts seeking individual courses to supplement their course catalogs or school districts seeking to offer an online education program to serve the needs of a small subset of their overall student population. Defining a more precise relevant market upon which to base a share estimate would not be meaningful due to significant limitations on the comparability of data among jurisdictions. For example, some providers to K12 virtual public schools serve only high school students; others serve elementary and middle school students, and some serve both. There are also providers of online virtual K-12 education that operate solely within individual states or geographic regions rather than globally as we do. Furthermore, some school districts offer their own virtual programs with which we compete. Parents in search of an alternative to their local public school have a number of alternatives beyond virtual and blended public schools, including private schools, public charter schools and home schooling. In our Private Pay schools, we compete for students seeking an English-based K12 education worldwide, and we currently draw students from more than 100 countries. In addition, our integrated learning systems consist of components that face competition from many different types of education companies, such as traditional textbook publishers, test and assessment firms and private education management companies. Finally, our learning systems are designed to operate domestically and internationally over the Internet, and thus, the geographic market for many of our products and services is global and indeterminate in size.

## Key Functional Areas

## Public Affairs, School Development, Student Recruitment and Marketing

We seek to increase public awareness of the educational and fiscal benefits of our online learning options through full-time virtual and blended instructional models, as well as supplementary course options. We receive numerous inquiries from school districts, legislators, public charter school boards, community leaders, state departments of education, educators and parents who express the desire to have a choice in public school options. Our public affairs and school development teams work together with these interested parties to identify and pursue opportunities to expand the use of our products and services in new and existing jurisdictions.

Our student recruitment and marketing team is focused on promoting the K-12 online education category and generating enrollments for the Company's virtual and blended school customers within that category. This is achieved by creating awareness among families with K-12 students through integrated marketing campaigns that include offline and digital media, as well as web assets. These campaigns are continuously optimized using data analytics and market research. The marketing team also assists in enhancing the onboarding experience of new students to online schooling. Additionally, our marketing team is working to ensure awareness of our adult learning options, delivered through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts brands.

## Operations

Over our 20 years of operation, we believe that we have gained significant experience in the sourcing, assembly and delivery of school supplies and materials. We have developed strong relationships with partners allowing us to source goods at favorable price, quality and service levels. Our fulfillment partner stores our inventory, assembles our learning kits and ships the kits to students. We have invested in systems, including our Order Management System, to automatically translate the curriculum selected by each enrolled student into a personalized order to fulfill the corresponding learning kits to ship to each student. As a result, we believe we have an end-to-end warehousing and fulfillment operation that will cost-effectively scale as the business grows in scope and complexity.

For many of our virtual and blended public school customers, we attempt to reclaim any materials that could be costeffectively re-utilized in the next school year. These items, once returned to our fulfillment centers, are refurbished and included in future learning kits. This reclamation process allows us to maintain lower materials costs. Our fulfillment activities are highly seasonal, and are centered on the start of school in August or September. In order to ensure that students in virtual and blended public schools have access to our systems, we often provide students with a computer, where applicable or required and all necessary support. We source computers and ship them to students when they enroll and reclaim the computers upon termination of their enrollment or withdrawal from the school in which they are enrolled.

## Technology

Our online learning systems, along with our back office support systems, are built on our proprietary Service Oriented Architecture ("SOA") to ensure high availability and redundancy. The flexibility and security enabled by our SOA are the core principles of our systems' foundation.

Service Oriented Architecture. All of our systems leverage our SOA that is built on top of proven Enterprise Technologies. The SOA allows us to develop iterative solutions expeditiously to meet both present and future market needs. Our high availability is also facilitated by this architecture. The SOA also enables integration with third-party solutions in our platform with ease and efficiency.

Availability and Redundancy. Our SOA allows for primary and secondary equipment to be utilized at all network and application tiers. Each application layer is load balanced across multiple servers, which, along with our network management capabilities, allows for additional hardware to be inserted into our network, providing us with optimal availability as evidenced by our typically greater than 99% uptime over a growing user base. We regularly backup critical data and store this backup data at an offsite location.

Cybersecurity. Our cybersecurity measures and policies include dividing application layers into multiple zones controlled by firewall technology. Sensitive communications are encrypted between client and server and our server-to-server accessibility is strictly controlled and monitored. We have contracted with an outside network and information cybersecurity firm to assist us with monitoring traffic and potential threats that may target our services and systems. We protect sensitive information through policy and control governance that is validated on a semi-annual basis, and maintain a layered security architecture. Third-party firms are engaged to test our networks, servers and applications for vulnerabilities. We have prepared an incident response plan that is designed to escalate information regarding material data breaches and cybersecurity attacks to the senior management of the Company. A business-centric information security program has also been adopted that is tailored to adjust to an ever-changing IT compliance and information security threat landscape. Although distributed denial-of-service attacks are frequently attempted, we have not experienced a significant disruption to our business as a result of these attacks.

Physical Infrastructure. We utilize leading vendors, such as Amazon Web Services, to provide a foundation for our SOA. Our systems are housed offsite in data centers that provide a robust, redundant network backbone, power and geographically separated disaster recovery. Our second data center, geographically separated from our primary center, operates as a ready business continuity site with secured, near-real time data replication from our primary data center. We are also in the process of migrating our entire application portfolio to Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services provides a robust technological framework, such as autoscaling, which aligns with our business. Our Network Operations Center (NOC) monitors our application and infrastructure ecosystem on a 7 X 24 X 365 basis, tracking our availability and performance. We also leverage Amazon Web Services Advanced Security technologies and framework, as well as third party security services, to ensure our networks, databases, applications and servers are secure and protected.

## Other Information

## Intellectual Property

We continue to invest in our intellectual property through internal development and by acquisitions as we aim to offer more courses for new grades and expand into adjacent education markets, both in the United States and overseas. Through acquisitions, we have also obtained curriculum, patents and trademarks that expand our portfolio of educational products and services. We continue to add features and tools to our proprietary learning platform and support systems to assist teachers and students and improve educational outcomes, such as adaptive learning technologies. These intellectual property assets are critical to our success and we avail ourselves of the full protections provided under the patent, copyright, trademark and trade secrets laws. We also routinely utilize confidentiality and licensing agreements with our employees, the virtual and blended public schools, traditional schools, school districts and private schools that we serve, individual consumers, contractors and other businesses and persons with which we have commercial relationships.

Our patent portfolio includes five U.S.-issued patents and two foreign-issued patents directed towards various aspects of our educational products and offerings. Three of the U.S.-issued patents and one of the foreign-issued patents encompass our system and methods of virtual schooling and online foreign language instruction. The other two U.S.-issued

## Table of Contents

patents and other one foreign-issued patent encompass our system and method for producing, delivering and managing educational material.

We own copyrights related to the lessons contained in the courses that comprise our proprietary curriculum. We also have obtained federal, state and foreign registrations for numerous trademarks that are related to our offerings and we have applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register certain new trademarks.

We grant licenses to individuals to use our software and access our online learning systems. Similarly, schools are granted licenses to utilize our online learning systems and other systems. These licenses are intended to protect our ownership and the confidentiality of the embedded information and technology contained in our software and systems. We also own many of the trademarks and service marks that we use as part of the student recruitment and branding services we provide to schools. Those marks are licensed to the schools for use during the term of the products and services agreements.

Our employees, contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.

## Human Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 7,100 employees, including approximately 3,600 teachers. Substantially all of these employees are located in the United States. In addition, there are approximately 3,600 teachers who are employed by virtual or blended public schools that we manage under contracts with those schools but are not direct employees of Stride. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement; however, certain managed public schools we serve employ unionized teachers. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Our success depends in large part on continued employment of senior management and key personnel who can effectively operate our business, which is necessary in the highly regulated public education sector involving a publicly traded for profit company. We believe a critical component to our success depends on the ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel.

We select and hire based upon our values of making an impact on the lives of our students. In addition to annual goals, and individual job duties, we consider demonstration of our core values-passion, accountability, courage, trust, and inclusiveness-an important factor in performance appraisals.

We support professional development opportunities that reflect our desire to 'hire from within' and to enhance employees' skillsets in ways that improve their effectiveness and sense of fulfillment. We offer our employees many different professional development opportunities through job related training and a number of benefit programs, including a Tuition Assistance Benefit, discount tuition options with several participating colleges and universities, and discounted options to access K-12 curriculum.

At our Company, we uphold a workplace culture that celebrates diversity and embraces inclusion. We are proud of our diverse workforce and recognize the value diversity brings to our team.

- ● 40% of our board is comprised of minorities and 30% are women.
- ● 60% of our executive leadership team is comprised of minorities and women.
- ● 56% of our full-time employees are women.
- ● For direct education-related roles, largely the K-12 teacher population, employee demographics mirror national averages for these positions.

We continue to recognize opportunities to improve our gender equity and minority representation. Various efforts are underway to create a more diverse workforce that supports our learner community, including robust professional,

## Table of Contents

managerial, and leadership development programs. In addition, we offer customized training for teams, as well as training that focuses on diversity and inclusion topics, including mandatory unconscious bias training for all employees.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly responded to support employees and their families. Whenever possible, employees have been provided flexibility with respect to remote working. For employees who were not able to perform their regular responsibilities virtually at the onset of the pandemic, we identified project work to ensure that every staff member remained fully employed. Additionally, we introduced a non-standard leave policy, which provided up to an additional 160 hours of paid time off (in addition to traditional paid time off programs) to individuals who could not perform their work virtually or were in need of additional time off due to illness.

## Regulation

We and the virtual and blended public schools that we serve are subject to regulation by and laws of each of the states in which we operate. The state laws and regulations that impact our business are primarily those that authorize or restrict our ability to operate these schools, the applicable funding mechanisms for the schools and the increasing number of states with their own, unique privacy laws. To the extent these schools receive federal funds, such as through a grant program or financial support dedicated for the education of low-income families, these schools also become subject to additional federal regulation.

State Laws Authorizing or Restricting Virtual and Blended Public Schools. The authority to operate a virtual or blended public school is dependent on the laws and regulations of each state. Laws and regulations vary significantly from one state to the next and are constantly evolving. In states that have implemented specific legislation to support virtual and blended public schools, the schools are able to operate under these statutes. Other states provide for virtual and blended public schools under existing public charter school legislation or provide that school districts and/or state education agencies may authorize them. Some states do not currently have legislation that provides for virtual and blended public schools or have requirements that effectively prohibit such schools and, as a result, may require new legislation before virtual and blended public schools can open in the state.

Obtaining new legislation in the remaining states where we do not have virtual and blended public schools can be a protracted and uncertain process. When determining whether to pursue expansion into new states in which the laws are ambiguous, we research the relevant legislation and policy climate and then make an assessment of the perceived likelihood of success before deciding to commit resources.

State Laws and Regulations Applicable to Virtual and Blended Public Schools. A virtual or blended public school that fails to comply with the state laws and regulations applicable to it may be required to repay these funds and could become ineligible for receipt of future state funds. To be eligible for state funding, some states require that virtual and blended public schools be organized as not-for-profit charters exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The schools must then be organized exclusively for charitable educational purposes, and not for the benefit of private, forprofit management companies. The board or governing authority of the not-for-profit virtual or blended public school must retain ultimate accountability and control for the school's operations to retain its tax-exempt status. It may not delegate its responsibility and accountability for the school's operations. Our service agreements with these virtual and blended public schools are, therefore, structured to ensure the full independence of the not-for-profit board and preserve its arms-length ability to exercise its fiduciary obligations to operate a virtual or blended public school.

## Table of Contents

Laws and regulations affect many aspects of operating a virtual or blended public school. They can dictate the content and sequence of the curriculum, the methods for counting student enrollments for funding purposes, graduation requirements, use of approved textbooks, the length of the school year and the school day, the accessibility of curriculum and technology to students with disabilities, teacher to student ratios, specific credentialing of teachers and administrators, the assessment of student performance and any accountability requirements. In addition, a virtual or blended public school may be obligated to comply with states' requirements to offer programs for specific populations, such as students at risk of dropping out of school, advanced and talented students, nonEnglish speaking students, pre-kindergarten students and students with disabilities. Tutoring services and the use of technology may also be regulated. Other state laws and regulations may affect the school's compulsory attendance requirements, treatment of absences and make-up work, and access by parents to student records and teaching and testing materials.

In addition to federal laws protecting the privacy of student education records, a growing number of states are enacting laws to protect the privacy of student data and to guard against its misuse. As a general matter, these laws are designed to prevent thirdparty vendors to schools from using student data for non-educational purposes and ensuring the security of personally identifiable information. In addition, virtual or blended public schools may have to comply with state requirements that school campuses report various types of data as performance indicators of the success of the program.

States have laws and regulations concerning the certification, training, experience and continued professional development of teachers and staff with which a virtual or blended public school may be required to comply. There are also numerous laws pertaining to employee salaries and benefits, statewide teacher retirement systems, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits and matters related to employment agreements and procedures for termination of school employees. State labor laws applicable to public-sector employees and their rights to organize may also apply to virtual charter schools, such as teachers they employ. A virtual or blended public school must also comply with requirements for performing criminal background checks on school staff, reporting criminal activity by school staff and reporting suspected child abuse. States such as California, Nevada and Virginia are also enacting more general laws about personal information that apply regardless of whether the individual is a student.

As with any public school, virtual and blended public schools must comply with state laws and regulations applicable to governmental entities, such as open meetings or sunshine laws, which may require the board of trustees of a virtual or blended public school to provide advance public notice of and hold its meetings open to the public unless an exception in the law allows an executive session. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to personal civil and/or criminal penalties for board members or officers or the invalidation of actions taken during meetings that were not properly noticed and open to the public. Virtual and blended public schools must also comply with public information or open records laws, which require them to make school records available for public inspection, review and copying unless a specific exemption in the law applies. Additionally, laws pertaining to records privacy and retention and to standards for maintenance of records apply to virtual and blended public schools.

Other types of regulation applicable to virtual and blended public schools include restrictions on the use of public funds, the types of investments made with public funds, accounting and financial management, and marketing practices.

There remains uncertainty about the extent to which virtual and blended public schools we serve may be required to comply with state laws and regulations applicable to traditional public schools because the concept of virtual and blended public schools is still evolving, especially as technology advances. Although we receive state funds indirectly, according to the terms of each service agreement with the local public school entity, our receipt of state funds subjects us to extensive state regulation and scrutiny. States routinely conduct audits of these schools, to verify enrollment, attendance, information technology security, fiscal accountability, special education services and other regulatory issues. While we may believe that a virtual public school or blended school we serve is compliant with state law, an agency's different interpretation of law in a particular state, or the application of facts to such law, could result in findings of non-compliance, potentially affecting future funding or repayment of past funding.

Regulations Restricting Virtual and Blended Public School Growth and Funding. As a public schooling alternative, some state and regulatory authorities have elected to proceed cautiously with virtual and blended public schools. Statutes or regulations that hinder our ability to serve certain jurisdictions include: restrictions on student eligibility, such as mandating attendance at a traditional public school prior to enrolling in a virtual or blended public school; caps on the total number of students in a virtual or blended public school; restrictions on grade levels served; geographic limitations on enrollments; fixing the percentage of per pupil funding that must be paid to teachers;

## Table of Contents

state-specific curriculum requirements; and limits on the number of charters that can be granted in a state; and requirements to obtain approval from a student's resident school district.

Funding regulations for virtual public schools and blended schools can take a variety of forms. These regulations include: (i) attendance-some state daily attendance rules were designed for traditional classroom procedures, and applying them to track daily attendance and truancy in an online setting can cause disputes to arise over interpretation and funding; (ii) enrollment eligibilitysome states place restrictions on the students seeking to enroll in virtual and blended public schools, resulting in lower aggregate funding levels; (iii) teacher contact time-some states have regulations that specify minimum levels of teacher-student face-to-face time; and (iv) completion of course work. These regulations can create logistical challenges for statewide virtual and blended public schools, reduce funding and eliminate some of the economic, academic and technological advantages of virtual learning.

Federal and State Grants. We have worked with some entities to secure public and grant funding that flows to virtual and blended public schools that we serve. These grants are awarded to the local or state education agency or to the not-for-profit entity that holds the charter of the virtual or blended public school on a competitive basis in some instances and on an entitlement basis in other instances. Grants awarded to public schools and programs-whether by a federal or state agency or nongovernmental organization-often include reporting requirements, procedures and obligations.

## Federal Laws Applicable to Virtual Public Schools and Blended Schools

Five primary federal laws are directly applicable to the day-to-day provision of educational services we provide to virtual and blended public schools:

Every Student Succeeds Act ("ESSA"). The ESSA, which took effect on August 2, 2016 and requires reauthorization after the 2020-2021 school year, represents a major change in federal education law by shifting much of education policy decision making back to the states and by providing most funding through block grants. Of particular significance to the Company is that the states have the discretion to develop and design their own accountability systems within a broad federal framework. In addition, states have been given the authority to adopt different types of annual accountability plans for school performance, including proficiency and growth standards for all students and subgroups. The ESSA makes clear that the U.S. Department of Education has a more limited role to impose federal mandates, direction or control over the authority given to the states. Notwithstanding these federal limitations, states are still required under ESSA to test students in reading or language arts and math annually in grades 3-8 and once in grades 1012, and in science once in each of the following grade spans: 3-5, 6-9 and 10-12. All states have plans approved by the U.S. Department of Education to demonstrate compliance with ESSA.

Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ("IDEA"). The IDEA is implemented through regulations governing every aspect of the special education of a child with one or more specific disabilities that fit within any of the disability categories listed in the Act. The IDEA created a responsibility on the part of a school to identify students who may qualify under the IDEA and to perform periodic assessments to determine the students' needs for services. A student who qualifies for services under the IDEA must have in place an individual education plan, which must be updated at least annually, created by a team consisting of school personnel, the student, and the parent. This plan must be implemented in a setting where the child with a disability is educated with non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. IDEA provides the student and parents with numerous due process rights relating to the student's program and education, including the right to seek mediation of disputes and make complaints to the state education agency. The schools we manage are responsible for ensuring the requirements of IDEA are met. The virtual public schools and blended schools are required to comply with certain requirements in IDEA concerning teacher certification and training. We, the virtual public school or the blended school could be required to provide additional staff, related services, supplemental aids and services or a private school option at our own cost to comply with the requirement to provide a free appropriate public education to each child covered under the IDEA. If we fail to meet this requirement, we, the virtual public school or blended school could lose federal funding and could be liable for compensatory educational services, reimbursement to the parent for educational service the parent provided and payment of the parent's attorney's fees.

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. A virtual public school or blended school receiving federal funds is subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Section 504") insofar as the regulations implementing the Act govern the education of students with disabilities as well as personnel and parents. Section 504 prohibits discrimination against a person on the basis of disability in any program receiving federal financial assistance if the person is otherwise qualified to participate in or receive benefit from the program. Students with disabilities not

## Table of Contents

specifically listed in the IDEA may be entitled to specialized instruction or related services pursuant to Section 504 if their disability substantially limits a major life activity. Beginning in 2011, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education interpreted both Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act to apply to elementary and secondary schools and to require that students with disabilities be afforded substantially equivalent ease of use as students without disabilities. As applied to online public schools, such "web accessibility" requires technical capabilities similar to those applied to procurements of information technology by the federal government under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Section 508") or standards adopted by the world-wide web consortium, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ("WCAG") Level A and Level AA. If a school fails to comply with the requirements and the procedural safeguards of Section 504, it may lose federal funds even though these funds flow indirectly to the school through a local board. In the case of bad faith or intentional wrongdoing, some courts have awarded monetary damages to prevailing parties in Section 504 lawsuits. Because there is no federal rule setting a uniform technical standard for determining web accessibility under Section 508 and Title II of the ADA, online service providers have no uniform standard of compliance. Some states have adopted the standards promulgated under Section 508 while others require WCAG Level A and/or Level AA or their own unique standards.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). Virtual public schools and blended schools are also subject to the FERPA which protects the privacy of a student's educational records and generally prohibits a school from disclosing a student's records to a third party without the parent's prior consent. The law also gives parents certain procedural rights with respect to their minor children's education records. A school's failure to comply with this law may result in termination of its eligibility to receive federal education funds. Schools that contract with vendors that violate FERPA may be prohibited from contracting with the vendor for five years.

Communications Decency Act. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 ("CDA") provides protection for online service providers against legal action being taken against them because of certain actions of others. For example, the CDA states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any data given by another provider of information content. Further, Section 230 of the CDA grants interactive online services of all types, broad immunity from tort liability so long as the information at issue is provided or posted by a third party. As part of our technology services offering, we provide an online school platform on which teachers and students may communicate. We also conduct live classroom sessions using Internet-based collaboration software and we may offer certain online community platforms for students and parents. While the CDA affords us with some protection from liability associated with the interactive online services we offer, there are exceptions to the CDA that could result in successful actions against us that give rise to financial liability.

Other Federal Laws. Other federal laws also apply to virtual managed schools, in some cases depending on the demographics associated with a school. For example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been deemed to apply to ELL Students, as further defined in the joint guidance issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education in January 2015. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 also applies, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in education programs, activities and employment, applies to all schools that receive federal funds. There are also other federal laws and regulations that affect other aspects of our business such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), which imposes certain parental notice and other requirements on us that are directed to children under 13 years of age who access the web-based schools we manage. In addition, the Children's Internet Protection Act requires that school districts that receive certain types of federal funding must ensure that they have technology which blocks or filters certain material from being accessed through the Internet. We have developed procedures by which computers that we ship to students meet this requirement. Many other federal and state laws, such as deceptive trade practices laws, the Lanham Act and others apply to us, just as they do to other businesses. If we fail to comply with these and other federal laws, we could be determined ineligible to receive funds from federal programs or face penalties.

## Laws and Regulations Applicable to Consumer Education Products offered by Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts

State Laws Authorizing or Restricting Private Post-Secondary Schools. The authority to operate a private postsecondary school is dependent on the laws and regulations of each state. Laws and regulations vary significantly from one state to the next and are constantly evolving, with regulatory authority vesting under various state agencies. Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts each currently operate in a multi-jurisdictional regulatory environment, maintaining licenses in several states. In states that have implemented specific legislation to license and oversee private post-secondary schools, Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts are able to operate under these statutes. State laws and regulations affect many aspects of operating a private post-secondary school, including, but not limited to, requiring the content and sequence of

the curriculum, the methodology for counting student enrollments and reporting outcomes, graduation requirements, the duration of the approved program, the accessibility of curriculum and technology to students with disabilities, specific credentialing of teachers and administrators, the assessment of student performance, accountability requirements, and compliance with student record collection and retention requirements.

Other types of state regulations applicable to private post-secondary schools include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the use of scholarships and tuition discounts, student payment policies and the collection of and use of student fees, accounting and financial management, and limitations on marketing and advertising practices. States also have laws and regulations concerning the certification, training, experience and continued professional development of teachers and staff with which private post-secondary schools may be required to comply. Additionally, state unfair competition and consumer protection laws and regulations apply to Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts in their dealings with the public, which include limitations on advertising and disclosures, and the structure of financing methods for consumer customers. Lastly, additional regulations and student outcome reporting requirements may affect Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts should they seek funding related to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in any given state.

## Federal Laws Applicable

Each of Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts does not qualify or receive Title IV funding under the Higher Education Act but is eligible for federal funding through its veteran's education and workforce programs. As such, each is required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and all Federal regulations adopted to carry out such laws. If we fail to comply with these federal laws, we could be determined ineligible to receive funds from federal programs or face penalties.

## Risks Related to Government Funding and Regulation of Public Education

The majority of our revenues come from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering in both the General Education and Career Learning markets and depends on per pupil funding amounts and payment formulas remaining near the levels existing at the time we execute service agreements with the schools we serve. If those funding levels or formulas are materially reduced or modified due to economic conditions or political opposition, or new restrictions are adopted or payments delayed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

The public schools we contract with are financed with government funding from federal, state and local taxpayers. Our business is primarily dependent upon those funds with a majority of our revenue coming from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offerings in both the General Education and Career Learning markets. Budget appropriations for education at all levels of government are determined through a legislative process that may be affected by negative views of for-profit education companies, recessionary conditions in the economy at large, or significant declines in public school funding. The results of federal and state elections can also result in shifts in education policy and the amount of funding available for various education programs.

The political process and potential variability in general economic conditions, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, create a number of risks that could have an adverse effect on our business including the following:

- ● Legislative proposals can and have resulted in budget or program cuts for public education, including the virtual and blended public schools and school districts we serve, and therefore have reduced and could potentially limit or eliminate the products and services those schools purchase from us, causing our revenues to decline. From time to time, proposals are introduced in state legislatures that single out virtual and blended public schools for disparate treatment.
- ● Economic conditions, including current and future business disruptions and debt and equity market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could reduce state education funding for all public schools or cause a delay in the payment of government funding to schools and school districts or a delay in payments to us for our products or services, the effects of which could be disproportionate for the schools we serve. Our annual revenue growth is impacted by changes in federal, state and district per pupil funding levels. For example, due to the budgetary problems arising from the 2008 recession, many states reduced per pupil funding for public education affecting many of the public schools we serve, including even abrupt midyear cuts in certain states, which in some cases were retroactively applied to the start of the school year as a result of formulaic adjustments. In addition, as we enter into service and product agreements with multiple schools in a single state, the aggregate impact of funding reductions applicable to those schools could be material. For example, we have agreements with 13 schools in California and while each school is independent with its own governing authority and no single school in California accounts for more than 10% of our revenue, regulatory actions that affect the level or timing of payments for all similarly situated schools in that state could adversely affect our financial condition. The specific level of federal, state and local funding for the coming years is not yet known for specific states and, when taken as a whole, it is reasonable to believe that a number of the public schools we serve could experience lower per pupil enrollment funding, while others may increase funding, as economic conditions or political conditions change.
- ● As a public company, we are required to file periodic financial and other disclosure reports with the SEC. This information may be referenced in the legislative process, including budgetary considerations, related to the funding of alternative public school options, including virtual public schools and blended schools. The disclosure of this information by a for-profit education company, regardless of parent satisfaction and student performance, may nonetheless be used by opponents of virtual and blended public schools to propose funding reductions or restrictions.
- ● From time to time, government funding to schools and school districts is not provided when due, which sometimes causes the affected schools to delay payments to us for our products and services. These payment delays have occurred in the past and can deprive us of significant working capital until the matter is resolved, which could hinder our ability to implement our growth strategies and conduct our business. For example, in fiscal year 2016, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was unable to approve a budget, including funding for public school education, and thus the Agora Cyber Charter School received no funds and could not make

## Table of Contents

timely contractual payments to the Company for our products and services, even though we continued to incur the costs to keep the school operating.

We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue and how our business and results of operations have been impacted or will be impacted in the future.

While we have observed increasing demand from prospective students due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot estimate the specific impact of COVID-19 on these demand trends, and there is no assurance that we will continue to experience current demand levels as the COVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as vaccinations become widely available. As a result, we expect to face difficulties in accurately forecasting financial results.

Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, poor academic performance, or misconduct by us or operators of other virtual public schools could tarnish the reputation of all the school operators in our industry, which could have a negative impact on our business or lead to punitive legislation.

As a non-traditional form of public education, online public school operators will be subject to scrutiny, perhaps even greater than that applied to traditional brick and mortar public schools or public charter schools. Not all virtual public schools will have successful academic programs or operate efficiently, and new entrants may not perform well either. Such underperformance could create the impression that virtual schooling is not an effective way to educate students, whether or not our learning systems achieve satisfactory performance. Consistently poor academic performance, or the perception of poor performance, could also lead to closure of an online public school or termination of an approved provider status in some jurisdictions, or to passage of legislation empowering the state to restructure or close low-performing schools. For example, a 2016 Nevada law expanded a charter authorizer's ability to terminate a charter based upon academic performance or to reconstitute a school's governing board, and a 2013 Tennessee law with academic performance criteria applying only to virtual schools.

Beyond academic performance issues, some virtual school operators, including us, have been subject to governmental investigations alleging, among other things, false attendance reporting, the misuse of public funds or failures in regulatory compliance. These allegations have attracted significant adverse media coverage and have prompted legislative hearings and regulatory responses. Investigations have focused on specific companies and individuals, or even entire industries, such as the industry-wide investigation of for-profit virtual schools initiated by the Attorney General of California in 2015. The precise impact of these governmental investigations on our current and future business is difficult to discern, in part because of the number of states in which we operate, the range of purported malfeasance or performance issues involved, or interest by state regulatory authorities. If these situations, or any additional alleged misconduct, cause all virtual public schools to be viewed by the public and/or policymakers unfavorably, we may find it difficult to expand into new states or renew our contracts with our clients.

Opponents of public charter schools, including virtual and blended, have sought to challenge the establishment and expansion of such schools through the judicial process. If these interests prevail, it could damage our ability to sustain or grow our current business or expand in certain jurisdictions.

We have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to public policy lawsuits by those who do not share our belief in the value of this form of public education or the involvement of for-profit education management companies. Whether we are a named party to these lawsuits, legal claims have involved challenges to the constitutionality of authorizing statutes, methods of instructional delivery, funding provisions and the respective roles of parents and teachers that can potentially affect us. For example, the Louisiana Association of Educators, an affiliate of a national teachers union, sought to terminate funding on state constitutional grounds to certain types of charter schools through the judicial process (including to a public school we serve), and while the teachers union was initially successful, the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed that decision in March 2018. See Iberville Parish School Board v. Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education , 2018 WL 1319404 (March 13, 2018).

## Table of Contents

## Should we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business, such failures could result in a loss of public funding and an obligation to repay funds previously received, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Once authorized by law, virtual and blended public schools are generally subject to extensive regulation, as are the school districts we serve. These regulations cover specific program standards and financial requirements including, but not limited to: (i) student eligibility standards; (ii) numeric and geographic limitations or caps on enrollments; (iii) state-specific curriculum requirements and standards; (iv) restrictions on open-enrollment policies by and among districts; (v) prescribed teacher to student ratios and teacher funding allocations from per pupil funding; (vi) teacher certification and reporting requirements; and (vii) virtual school attendance reporting. State and federal funding authorities conduct regular program and financial audits of the public schools we serve to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. If a final determination of non-compliance is made, additional funds may be withheld which could impair that school's ability to pay us for services in a timely manner, or the school could be required to repay funds received during the period of non-compliance. Additionally, the indemnity provisions in our standard service agreements with virtual and blended public schools and school districts may require us to return any contested funds on behalf of the school.

As an emerging form of public education with unique attributes, enabling legislation for online public schools is often ambiguous and subject to discrepancies in interpretation by regulatory authorities, which may lead to disputes over our ability to invoice and receive payments for services rendered.

Statutory language providing for virtual and blended public schools is sometimes interpreted by regulatory authorities in ways that may vary from year to year making compliance subject to uncertainty. More issues normally arise during our first few school years of doing business in a state because such state's enabling legislation often does not address specific issues, such as what constitutes proper documentation for enrollment eligibility or attendance reporting in a virtual or blended school. From time to time there are changes to the regulators' approach to determining the eligibility of students for funding purposes. Another issue may be differing interpretations on what constitutes a student's substantial completion of a semester in a public school or daily attendance requirements. These regulatory uncertainties may lead to disputes over our ability to invoice and receive payments for services rendered or to disputes with auditors of public schools, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in October 2017, the California Department of Education commenced an audit covering, among other things, the average daily attendance records and associated funding provided to the California Virtual Academies ("CAVAs"), dependent on the proper method of counting the time-value and daily engagement of students enrolled in independent study programs provided by non-classroom based charter schools and the regulations applicable to such programs and schools.

## The operation of virtual and blended public charter schools depends on the maintenance of the authorizing charter and compliance with applicable laws. If these charters are not renewed, our contracts with these schools would be terminated.

In many cases, virtual and blended public schools operate under a charter that is granted by a state or local authorizer to the charter holder, such as a community group or an established not-for-profit corporation, which typically is required by state law to qualify for student funding. In fiscal year 2021, a majority of our revenue was derived from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offerings in both the General Education and Career Learning markets, the majority of which were virtual and blended public schools operating under a charter. The service and products agreement for these schools is with the charter holder or the charter board. Nonprofit public charter schools qualifying for exemption from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) as charitable organizations must also operate on an arms-length basis in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rules and policies to maintain that status and their funding eligibility. In addition, many state public charter school statutes require periodic reauthorization. If a virtual or blended public school we support fails to maintain its tax-exempt status and funding eligibility, fails to renew its charter, or if its charter is revoked for non-performance or other reasons that may be due to actions of the independent charter board completely outside of our control, our contract with that school would be terminated. For example, in fiscal year 2018, the Buckeye Community Hope Foundation terminated the charter of Insight School of Ohio.

## Actual or alleged misconduct by current or former directors, officers, key employees or officials could make it more difficult for us to enter into new contracts or renew existing contracts.

If we or any of our current or former directors, officers, key employees, or officials are accused or found to be guilty of serious crimes or civil violations, including the mismanagement or improper accounting of public funds, or

## Table of Contents

violations of the federal securities laws, the schools we serve could be barred or discouraged from entering into or renewing service agreements with us. As a result, our business and revenues would be adversely affected.

## New laws or regulations not currently applicable to for-profit education companies in the K-12 sector could be enacted and negatively impact our operations and financial results.

As the provision of online K-12 public education matures, policy or business practice issues may arise that could lead to the enactment of new laws or regulations similar to, or in addition to, laws or regulations applicable to other education industry sectors. For example, for-profit education companies that own and operate post-secondary colleges and programs depend in significant respect on student loans provided by the federal government to cover tuition expenses and income sharing agreements, and federal laws prohibit incentive compensation for success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person engaged in student recruiting or admission activities. In contrast, while students in virtual or blended public K-12 schools are entitled to a public education with no federal or state loans necessary for tuition, laws could be enacted that make for-profit management companies serving such schools subject to similar recruitment or other restrictions. In keeping with good business practices, we do not award or permit incentive compensation to be paid to our public school program enrollment staff or contractors based on the number of students enrolled. New laws that specifically target for-profit education companies or education management organizations from operating public charter schools could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.

## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

The schools we contract with and serve are governed by independent governing bodies that may shift their priorities or change objectives in ways that are adverse to us and to the students who attend the school programs we administer, or they may react negatively to acquisitions or other transactions.

We contract with and provide a majority of our products and services to virtual and blended public schools governed by independent boards or similar governing bodies. While we typically share a common objective at the outset of our business relationship, over time our interests could diverge resulting in changes adverse to our business or the students enrolled in those schools. The governing boards of the schools we serve in which we hire the Principal or Head of School ("HoS") may seek to employ their own HoS as a condition for contract renewal. This decision may potentially reduce the value of the programs they purchase from us by structurally separating the HoS from regular involvement with our virtual school management experts, employee-based professional development programs, and internal understanding of the proprietary curriculum and innovations we develop to improve academic performance. As these independent boards shift their priorities or change objectives, reduce or modify the scope of services and products we provide, or terminate their relationship with us, our ability to generate revenues consistently over time or to improve academic outcomes would be adversely affected.

Our contracts for a school-as-a-service offering are subject to periodic renewal, and each year some of these agreements are set to expire. If we are unable to renew several such contracts or if a single significant contract expires during a given year, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.

In fiscal year 2021, we had contracts for our school-as-a-service offerings for 77 schools in 30 states and the District of Columbia. A portion of these contracts are scheduled to expire in any given year and may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms much less favorable to us. Most of these contracts include auto renewal provisions having significant advance notice deadlines. The advance notice provisions are intended to allow sufficient time to engage in renewal negotiations before and during the final year of these contracts. A renewed contract could involve a restructuring of our services and management arrangements that could lower our revenue or even change how revenue and expenses are recognized. When the customer prefers the existing contract terms to be extended, it can elect to disregard the advance notice provision and have the contract automatically renew. If we are unable to renew contracts or if contract renewals have significantly less favorable terms or unbundle previously provided services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.

## Table of Contents

If the schools we serve fail to enroll or re-enroll a sufficient number of students, or we fail to enroll a significant number of students in the Career Learning programs for adult learners, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.

A majority of our revenues are a direct function of how many students are enrolled in our school-as-a-service offerings, the number of school districts and students who subscribe to such district programs, and the enrollments in our three international and private pay schools.

Because families have alternative choices both within and outside the public school system for educating their children, it is typical during each school year that some students withdraw from schools using our online education services and switch to their traditional local public schools, other charter school alternatives or private schools. While many of our school-as-a-service offerings also accept new student enrollment throughout the year where permitted, generally our average student enrollment declines as the school year progresses such that we serve on average fewer students at the end of any given school year than at the beginning of the year. If our school-as-a-service offerings experience higher withdrawal rates during the year and/or enroll fewer new students as the year progresses than we have experienced in the past, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Similarly, at the start of each new school year, students who had remained enrolled through the end of the previous year may have graduated from the terminal grade in a school or have left our school-as-a-service offerings for any number of reasons. To the extent our school-as-a-service offerings do not retain previously enrolled students from the prior year, they must attract new students at the start of the year to sustain their average student enrollment year over year, as well as to grow their enrollment each year, based upon enrollment objectives determined by the governing authority of those schools. If the schools we serve in the aggregate are able only to sustain prior year enrollment levels, our revenues may not grow from the prior year, absent improved revenue capture or the addition of new schools. More fundamentally, if average student enrollment at the schools we serve declines from one year to the next, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.

We also contract with virtual public schools and school districts to provide marketing and enrollment services, and we provide similar services directly to our international and private pay schools. However, many of these customers are responsible for their own marketing and enrollment activities. Efforts on our part to sustain or increase enrollments in the face of higher student withdrawals or fewer returning students at the start of a school year may lead to higher costs for us, and may adversely affect our operating margin. If we or the virtual public schools and school districts are unsuccessful in marketing plans or enrollment processes for the schools, the average student enrollment at the schools may not grow or could even decline, and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

We also derive revenues from our Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts offerings to adult learners. The vast majority of the enrollments in these programs are for shorter periods of time, and re-enrollments are not typical due to the nature of these offerings. Thus, we must continually attract and enroll new adult learners in order to maintain our revenues at current levels or grow our revenues. Efforts on our part to sustain or increase enrollments in the face of lower enrollments compared to prior periods may lead to higher costs for us, and may adversely affect our operating margin. If we are unsuccessful in marketing plans or enrollment processes for these programs for adult learners, the average enrollment in our Galvanize, Tech Elevator or MedCerts offerings may not grow or could even decline, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

## The enrollment data we present is subject to certain limitations and may not fully capture trends in the performance of our business.

We periodically disclose enrollment data for students in our General Education and Career Learning lines of revenue. However, this data may not fully capture trends in the performance of our business for a number of reasons, including:

- ● Enrollments for General Education and Career Learning only include those students in full service public or private programs where Stride provides a combination of curriculum, technology, instructional and support services inclusive of administrative support;
- ● This data includes enrollments for which Stride receives no public funding or revenue;

## Table of Contents

- ● No enrollments are included in Career Learning for Galvanize, Tech Elevator or MedCerts; and
- ● Over time a student may move from being counted as a General Education enrollment to being counted as a Career Learning enrollment, or vice versa, depending on the educational choices made by each student, which choices in certain cases may be impacted by counseling from Stride employees, and this may result in enrollment growth in one line of revenue being offset by a corresponding decrease in enrollments for the other line of revenue.

Accordingly, changes in enrollment data may not entirely correspond with changes in the financial performance of our business, and if the mix of enrollments changes, our revenues will be impacted to the extent the average revenues per enrollments are significantly different.

Because the independent governing authorities of our customers may shift priorities or incur new obligations which have financial consequences, we may be exposed to the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer.

If our customers were to cause or be subjected to situations that lead to a weakened financial condition, dispute our invoices, withhold payments, or file for bankruptcy, we could experience difficulty and prolonged delays in collecting receivables, if at all. Any nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in fiscal year 2017, as the Agora Cyber Charter School continued to operate as a self-managed charter school, it delayed its payments to us and our accounts receivable from the school have grown significantly, resulting in a revised payment schedule agreement, which accompanied a contract extension.

As we continue to refine our marketing efforts, and support the enrollment activities for our school-as-a-service offerings and adult learning programs, changes in our marketing efforts and enrollment activities could lead to a decline in overall enrollment at the schools we serve or at the adult learning programs we offer.

As parents evaluate school choices for their children, we are segmenting our marketing efforts to better attract students who are most likely to benefit from and succeed in virtual education programs and who are likely to remain enrolled with a virtual school over several years. Our research leads us to believe that students with parents who are active and regularly engaged in their education are more likely to be successful in a virtual school. In some cases, the governing authorities of these schools may request different enrollment policies or criteria. Our marketing efforts, therefore, may not be wholly successful, and could lead to an overall decline in enrollment for our school-as-a-service, thus adversely affecting our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, for our Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts offerings to adult learners, we are focusing our marketing and enrollment efforts to identify and attract adult learners in dat a science, software engineering, healthcare, medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers and government agencies. However, our marketing efforts may not be successful. As a result, our overall enrollment in these adult learning programs may decline and our revenue, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

## The student demographics of the schools we serve can lead to higher costs and affect our ability to sustain or grow our operating income.

The schools we serve are publicly funded and are generally obligated to accept all students meeting state or district criteria for enrollment. Because an online education environment may offer a better educational opportunity for students falling behind grade level, our school-as-a-service offerings have experienced in recent years a higher academically at-risk student population, requiring supplemental student and family support services and closer one-on-one involvement by teachers and school personnel, leading to higher costs to us in providing full management and curriculum services to the schools. We consider students academically at-risk if they were not proficient on the previous year's state assessment, are credit-deficient, have previously dropped out, have failed courses, or score lower than average on diagnostic norm-referenced assessments. Some states have additional or different indicators to determine students who are at risk. These factors are used by the state to identify at-risk students in several states and have been found through research to impact future student performance. The schools we serve also enroll a significant percentage of special needs students with learning and/or physical disabilities, which also adds to the total costs incurred by the schools.

## Table of Contents

Education of high school students is generally more costly than K-8 as more teachers with subject matter expertise (e.g., chemistry, calculus) must be hired to support an expansive curriculum, electives, and counseling services. As the relative percentage of high school students increases as part of the total average enrollment in our school-as-a-service offerings, our costs are likely to increase.

As our cost structure evolves due to the demographics, educational profile and mix of the students enrolled in our school-asa-service offerings, our profit margins may decline, and we may have increasing difficulty in sustaining or growing our operating income commensurate with our revenues.

If student performance falls, state accountability standards are not achieved, teachers or administrators tamper with state test scoring or modified graduation requirements, or parent and student satisfaction declines, a significant number of students may not remain enrolled in a virtual or blended public school that we serve, or charters may not be renewed or enrollment caps could be put in place, or enrollment practices could be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.

The success of our business depends in part on the choice of a family to have their child begin or continue his or her education in a virtual or blended public school that we serve. This decision is based on many factors, including student performance and parent and student satisfaction. Students may perform significantly below state averages or the virtual or blended public school may fail to meet state accountability standards. Like many traditional brick and mortar public schools, not all of the public schools we serve meet the requirements of their applicable accountability frameworks, as large numbers of new enrollments from students underperforming in traditional schools can decrease overall results or the underperformance of any one subgroup can lead to the entire school failing to meet accountability expectations and potentially lead to the school's closure. For example, in Tennessee, the Commissioner of Education has statutory authority to close a virtual school if an accountability trigger is met. In addition, although serving academically at-risk students is an important aspect of our obligation to educate any child regardless of circumstance, the performance of these students can adversely affect a school's standing under applicable accountability standards. We expect that, as our enrollments increase and the portion of students that have not used our learning systems for multiple years increases, the average performance of all students using our learning systems may decrease, even if the individual performance of other students improves over time. This effect may also be exacerbated if students enrolled in schools that we provide services to or acquire are predominately below state proficiency standards or experience low graduation rates. For example, at-risk students who attended the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow (ECOT) schools in Ohio which were closed in mid-school year 2017-18 by state regulators, and who then transferred to other public schools, including the Ohio Virtual Academy supported by us, could negatively impact a receiving school's overall academic performance ratings absent a different accountability measure applicable to such students or waiver of such standards. Moreover, under ESSA, state authorities may change their accountability frameworks in ways that negatively impact the schools we serve.

Students in the school-as-a-service offerings we serve are required to complete standardized state testing, and the frequency and the results of this testing may have an impact on school enrollment. The significant increase of testing undertaken at the state level has led some parents to opt out of state assessments, a parental right which is now codified in the ESSA, thereby resulting in an incomplete and potentially inaccurate assessment of school and student performance. To avoid the consequences of failing to meet applicable required proficiency, growth or accountability standards, teachers or school administrators may engage in improperly altering student test scores or graduation standards especially if teacher performance and compensation are evaluated on these results. Finally, parent and student satisfaction may decline as not all parents and students are able to devote the substantial time and effort necessary to complete our curriculum. A student's satisfaction may also suffer if his or her relationship with the virtual or blended public school teacher does not meet expectations. If student performance or satisfaction declines, students may decide not to remain enrolled in a virtual or blended public school that we serve and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The transition from a federally mandated approach for curriculum standards and assessments to individual state determinations under the ESSA may create ongoing challenges to ensure that our curriculum products align with state requirements, which could possibly cause academic performance to decline and dissatisfaction by our school customers which could limit our growth and profitability.

Under the ESSA, states will set their own curriculum standards in reading, math and science, and the federal government is prohibited from mandating or incentivizing states to adopt any set of particular standards, such as Common Core. States were also given the authority under the ESSA to craft their own assessment programs to measure the

proficiency of their students for college and career readiness, and may also choose to offer already available nationally recognized assessments at the high school level, such as the SAT or ACT tests. As implementation proceeds at the state level, and use of the assessments previously developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers and Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium consortia continues to erode, a multitude of different standards and assessments may emerge and result in temporary misalignments of our curriculum offerings with state standards, cause academic performance to decline, create a need for additional teacher training and product investments, all of which could adversely affect our relationship with public school contracting with us for a school-as-a-service offering and school district customers, financial condition, contract renewals and reputation.

## Mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that formed the basis for the transaction.

When strategic opportunities arise to expand our business, we may acquire or invest in other companies using cash, stock, debt, asset contributions or any combination thereof, such as the acquisitions of Galvanize in January 2020, Tech Elevator in November 2020 and MedCerts in November 2020. We may face risks in connection with these or other future transactions, including the possibility that we may not realize the anticipated cost and revenue synergies on a timely basis, or at all, or further the strategic purpose of any acquisition if our forecasts do not materialize. The pursuit of acquisitions and their integrations may divert the resources that could otherwise be used to support and grow our existing lines of business. The combination of two or more independent enterprises is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Acquisitions may create multiple and overlapping product lines that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays in service. We may have difficulties coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company's capabilities. Customers may decline to renew their contracts or the contracts of acquired businesses might not allow us to recognize revenues on the same basis. These transactions and their integrations may also divert our management's attention and our ongoing business may be disrupted by acquisition, transition or integration activities. In addition, we may have difficulty separating, transitioning and integrating an acquired company's systems, including but not limited to, financial accounting systems, information technology systems, transaction processing systems, internal controls and standards, and procedures and policies, and the associated costs in doing so may be higher than we anticipate.

There may also be other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition associated with the expansion of our business through acquisitions. We may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology, which could result in unexpected operating expenses, unexpected accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due or a loss of anticipated tax benefits. The acquired companies, including Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts, may not be able to achieve the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we expect. Our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including investment in other areas of our business, stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness. If we issue a significant amount of equity for future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. We may pay more than the acquired company or assets are ultimately worth and we may have underestimated our costs in continuing the support and development of an acquired company's offerings. Our operating results may be adversely impacted by liabilities resulting from a stock or asset acquisition, which may be costly, disruptive to our business, or lead to litigation.

We may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities on a timely basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations. We may face contingencies related to intellectual property, financial disclosures, and accounting practices or internal controls. Finally, we may not be able to retain key executives of an acquired company.

To execute our business plans, we depend upon the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees, including those who joined us as part of the Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts acquisitions. The combined company's success will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees, some of which may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company as a result of the acquisition. This may have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.

## Table of Contents

## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. If activist stockholders were to emerge, their activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and divert resources from our business. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention of management and our Board of Directors. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities, cause key executives to leave the Company, adversely affect the relationships we have with our school board customers, and harm existing and new business prospects.

## If market demand for online options in public schooling does not increase or continue or if additional states do not authorize or adequately fund virtual or blended public schools, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

While historically we grew by opening new virtual public schools in new states, in recent years the pace of state expansion has declined while opening more schools in existing states has increased. In fiscal year 2021, we served 77 virtual public schools and blended schools in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Without adding additional states, our school-as-a-service revenues may become increasingly dependent on serving more virtual schools in existing states. We may also not be able to fill available enrollment slots as forecasted. If the market demand for virtual and blended public schools does not increase or declines, if the remaining states are hesitant to authorize virtual or blended public schools, if enrollment caps are not removed or raised, or if the funding of such schools is inadequate, our opportunities for growth and our ability to sustain our revenues, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

## Increasing competition in the education industry sectors that we serve could lead to pricing pressures, reduced operating margins, loss of market share, departure of key employees and increased capital expenditures.

As a general matter, we face varying degrees of competition from a variety of education providers because our learning systems integrate all the elements of the education development and delivery process, including curriculum development, textbook publishing, teacher training and support, lesson planning, testing and assessment, job placement and industry-certified content, and school performance and compliance management. In both our General Education and Career Learning markets, we compete with companies that provide online curriculum and support services. We also compete with public school districts and state departments of education that offer K-12 online programs of their own or in partnership with other online curriculum vendors. As we pursue our post-secondary Career Learning strategic initiatives through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts subsidiaries, we will be competing with corporate training businesses and some employers that offer education as an employee benefit. We anticipate intensifying competition both from existing competitors and new entrants. Our competitors may adopt superior curriculum content, technology and learning platforms, school support and marketing approaches, with different pricing and service packages that may have greater appeal than our offerings. In addition, some of our school-as-a-service offerings could seek to transition to a selfmanaged school by inviting competitive alternatives to portions of the products and services now provided entirely by us under our integrated fully managed service agreements. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business, win and renew contracts, including fully managed public school contracts, or students fail to realize sufficient gains in academic performance, our revenues, opportunities for growth and operating margins may decline. Price competition from our current and future competitors could also result in reduced revenues, reduced margins or the failure of our product and service offerings to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance.

We may also face competition from publishers of traditional educational materials that are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and may enter the field through acquisitions and mergers. Many of these traditional publishers, or new market entrants, have developed their own online curriculum products and teaching materials that compete directly with our post-secondary Career Learning products. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources and move quickly to develop products and services that are superior to our platform and technologies. We may not have the resources necessary to acquire or compete with technologies being developed by our competitors, which may render our online delivery format less competitive or obsolete. These new and well-funded entrants may also seek to attract our key executives as employees based on their acquired expertise in virtual education where such specialized skills are not widely available.

## Table of Contents

Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our curriculum and our technology, as well as our ability to increase capital expenditures to sustain the competitive position of our product and retain our talent base. We cannot assure that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete effectively.

## Regulatory frameworks on the accessibility of technology and curriculum are continually evolving due to legislative and administrative developments and the rapid evolution of technology, which could result in increased product development costs and compliance risks.

Our online curriculum is made available to students through websites, computers and other display devices connected to the Internet. The website platforms and online curriculum include a combination of software applications that include graphics, pictures, videos, animations, sounds and interactive content that may present challenges to individuals with disabilities. A number of states and federal authorities have considered or are considering how web-based information should be made accessible to persons with such disabilities. To the extent they enact or interpret laws and regulations to require greater accessibility than we currently provide, we may have to modify our offerings to satisfy those requirements. Because there is no federal rule setting a uniform technical standard for determining web accessibility under Section 508 and Title II of the ADA, online service providers have no uniform standard of compliance. Some states have adopted the standards promulgated under Section 508 while others require WCAG Level A and/or Level AA or their own unique standards. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is designed to ensure that students with disabilities have an equal opportunity to access each school's website and online learning environment. To the extent that we enter into federal government contracts, different standards of compliance could be imposed on us under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, or by states who apply these federal standards under Section 508 or other standards to education providers, which standards may be changed from time to time. Beyond the significant product development costs associated with these evolving regulations, a failure to meet such requirements could also result in loss or termination of material contracts, inability to secure new contracts, or in potential legal liability.

Our revenues from our school-as-a-service offerings are based in part on our estimate of the total funds each school will receive in a particular school year and our estimate of the full year expenses to be incurred by each school. As a result, differences between our quarterly estimates and the actual funds received and expenses incurred could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

We recognize revenues ratably from certain of our fees charged to school-as-a-service offerings over the course of our fiscal year. To determine the pro rata amount of revenues to recognize in a fiscal quarter, we estimate the total expected funds each school will receive in a particular school year. Additionally, we take responsibility for any operating deficits incurred at most of the schoolas-a-service offerings we serve. Because this may impair our ability to collect the full amount invoiced in a period and therefore collection cannot reasonably be assured, we reduce revenues by the estimated pro rata amount of the school's net operating loss. We review our estimates of total funds and operating expenses periodically, and we revise as necessary, by adjusting our year-to-date earned revenues to be proportional to the expected revenues to be earned during the fiscal year. Actual school funding received and school operating expenses incurred may vary from our estimates or revisions and could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.

## Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and adversely impact our working capital and liquidity throughout the year.

Our operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to the number of months in a fiscal quarter that our school customers are fully operational and serving students. In the typical academic year, our first and fourth fiscal quarters have fewer than three full months of operations, whereas our second and third fiscal quarters will have three complete months of operations. Instructional costs and services increase in the first fiscal quarter primarily due to the costs incurred to ship learning kits at the beginning of the school year. These instructional costs may increase significantly quarter-to-quarter as school operating expenses increase. The majority of our selling and marketing expenses are incurred in the first and fourth fiscal quarters, as our primary enrollment season is April through September.

We expect quarterly fluctuations in our operating results to continue. These fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect our cash flow. As our business grows, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced. As a result, we believe that sequential quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not provide an accurate assessment of our financial position.

## Risks Related to Our Operations

We plan to continue to create new products, expand distribution channels and pilot innovative educational programs to enhance academic performance. If we are unable to effectively manage these initiatives or they fail to gain acceptance, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.

As we create and acquire new products, expand our existing customer base and pilot new educational programs, we expect to face challenges distinct from those we currently encounter, including:

- ● our continual efforts to innovate and pilot new programs to enhance student learning and to foster college and career opportunities, such as our Stride Career Prep schools which offer pathways for Career Learning, may not receive sufficient market acceptance to be economically viable;
- ● the ongoing transition of our curriculum from Flash to HTML, and our use of third party educational platforms that we do not control, could create issues with customer satisfaction, early withdrawals and declines in re-registrations, and potentially harm our reputation;
- ● the acquisition or opening of additional school-as-a-service offering in states where we already have a contract with other schools can potentially complicate the school selection process for prospective parents, and present marketing differentiation challenges depending on the facts and circumstances in that state;
- ● our development of public blended schools has raised different operational challenges than those we face with full-time virtual schools. Blended schools require us to lease facilities for classrooms, staff classrooms with teachers, sometimes provide meals and kitchen facilities, adhere to local safety and fire codes, purchase additional insurance and fulfill many other responsibilities;
- ● operating in international markets may require us to conduct our business differently than we do in the United States or in existing countries. Additionally, we may have difficulty training and retaining qualified teachers or generating sufficient demand for our products and services in international markets. International opportunities will also present us with different legal, operational, tax and currency challenges;
- ● the use of our curriculum in classrooms will produce challenges with respect to adapting our curriculum for effective use in a traditional classroom setting;
- ● our creation of curricula and instruction protocols for courses taught through our Galvanize, Tech Elevator and MedCerts subsidiaries requires us to rely upon specialized instructors and curriculum developers;
- ● our online private school business is dependent on a tuition-based financial model and may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of students over time to achieve long-run profitability or deliver a high level of customer satisfaction; and
- ● our participation in summer foreign language instruction camps through MIL could generate new legal liabilities and financial consequences associated with our responsibility for students housed on leased college campuses on a 24-hour basis over the duration of the camp.

Our failure to manage these business expansion programs, or any new business expansion program or new distribution channel we pursue, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

High-quality teachers are critical to the success of our learning systems. If we are not able to continue to recruit, train and retain quality certified teachers, our curriculum might not be effectively delivered to students, compromising their academic performance and our reputation. As a result, our brand, business and operating results may be adversely affected.

High-quality teachers are critical to maintaining the value of our learning systems and assisting students with their daily lessons. In addition, teachers in the public schools we manage or who provide instruction in connection with

## Table of Contents

the online programs we offer to school districts, must be state certified (with limited exceptions or temporary waiver provisions in various states), and we must implement effective internal controls in each jurisdiction to ensure valid teacher certifications, as well as the proper matching of certifications with student grade levels and subjects to be taught. Teachers must also possess strong interpersonal communications skills to be able to effectively instruct students in a virtual school setting, and the technical skills to use our technology-based learning systems. There is a limited pool of teachers with these specialized attributes and the public schools and school districts we serve must provide competitive benefits packages to attract and retain such qualified teachers.

The teachers in many public schools we serve are not our employees and the ultimate authority relating to those teachers resides with an independent not-for-profit governing body, which oversees the schools. However, under many of our service and product agreements with virtual and blended public schools, we have responsibility to recruit, train and manage these teachers. The teacher recruitment and student assignment procedures and processes for our school-as-a-service offerings must also comply with individual state certification and reporting requirements. We must also provide continuous training to virtual and blended public school teachers so they can stay abreast of changes in student needs, academic standards and other key trends necessary to teach online effectively, including measures of effectiveness. We may not be able to recruit, train and retain enough qualified teachers to keep pace with school demand while maintaining consistent teaching quality in the various public schools we serve. Shortages of qualified teachers, failures to ensure proper teacher certifications and course assignments in each state, or decreases in the quality of our instruction, whether actual or perceived, could have an adverse effect on our business.

## School teachers are subject to union organizing campaigns, and if the teachers employed by us or at the public schools we serve join a union, collective bargaining agreements negotiated with union representatives could result in higher operating expenses and the loss of management flexibility and innovation for which charter schools were created.

If the teachers at any one of the public schools we serve were to unionize, as is the case in California, the employer would become subject to a collective bargaining agreement with union representatives. A collective bargaining agreement could impact teacher salaries, benefits, work rules, teacher tenure and provide for restrictions on the teaching work-day and the time devoted to online instruction delivery or communications with students, and place limitations on the flexibility to reassign or remove teachers for inadequate performance. This could result in higher school-related expenses and could impede the sustainability of, or growth in, enrollment at the school due to the loss of management flexibility and innovation. The outcome could result in higher costs to us in providing educational support and curriculum services to the school, which may adversely affect our operating margins, overall revenues and academic performance results.

## We rely on third-party service providers to host some of our solutions and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and harm our business.

We currently outsource some of our hosting services to third parties. We do not control the operation of any third party facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these disasters or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Furthermore, the availability of our proprietary and third-party LMSs could be interrupted by a number of additional factors, including our customers' inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems due to human or other error, security breaches or the ability of the infrastructure to handle spikes in customer usage. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.

## We operate a complex Company-wide enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system and if it were to experience significant operating problems, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We operate a complex Company-wide, Oracle-hosted, integrated ERP system to handle various business, operating and financial processes which handles a variety of important functions, such as order entry, invoicing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, financial consolidation and internal and external financial and management reporting matters. If the ERP system experiences significant problems, it could result in operational issues including delayed billing and accounting errors and other operational issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. System delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report results of our

## Table of Contents

operations, financial position and cash flows, which could impact our ability to timely complete important business processes.

## The continued development of our product and service brands is important to our business. If we are not able to maintain and enhance these brands, our business and operating results may suffer.

Enhancing brand awareness is critical to attracting and retaining students, and for serving additional virtual and blended public schools, school districts and online private schools, and we intend to spend significant resources to accomplish that objective. These efforts include sales and marketing directed to targeted locations as well as the national marketplace, discrete student populations, the educational community at large, key policy groups, image-makers and the media. As we continue to seek to increase enrollments and extend our geographic reach and product and service offerings, maintaining quality and consistency across all our services and products may become more difficult to achieve, and any significant and well-publicized failure to maintain this quality and consistency will have a detrimental effect on our brands. We cannot provide assurances that our new sales and marketing efforts will be successful in further promoting our brands in a competitive and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to further enhance our brand recognition and increase awareness of our products and services, or if we incur excessive sales and marketing expenses, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.

Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets. For example, we have been granted three U.S. patents related to our provision of virtual schooling, including the system components for creating and administering assessment tests and our lesson progress tracker, and two U.S. patents related to foreign language instruction. Additionally, we are the copyright owner of courses in our proprietary curriculum.

Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For instance, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. If we fail to protect adequately our intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, license agreements, employment agreements, confidentiality agreements, nondisclosure agreements or similar agreements, our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage we may have. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

It is possible that we may not be able to sufficiently protect our innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Further, there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent be deemed invalid or unenforceable.

We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. This secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, or by our employees or former employees, intentionally or accidentally, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. Third parties may acquire domain names that are substantially similar to our domain names leading to a decrease in the value of our domain names and trademarks and other proprietary rights.

## Lawsuits against us alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others and such actions would be costly to defend, could require us to pay damages or royalty payments and could limit our ability or increase our costs to use certain technologies in the future.

Companies in the Internet, software, technology, education, curriculum and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merits, intellectual property claims are time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. For example, a non-practicing entity sued us alleging that our proprietary learning

## Table of Contents

systems infringed three of its patents although its lawsuit was ultimately dismissed on the merits in 2014. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue certain products, services or practices that are found to be in violation of another party's rights. We may also have to seek a license and make royalty payments to continue offering our products and services or following such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses.

We may be subject to legal liability resulting from the actions of third parties, including independent contractors, business partners, or teachers, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and damage our reputation.

We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to legal claims associated with the actions of or filed by our independent contractors, business partners, or teachers. In the event of accidents or injuries or other harm to students, we could face claims alleging that we were negligent, provided inadequate supervision or were otherwise liable for their injuries and our insurance may not cover the expenses of litigation or settlement amounts. Additionally, we could face claims alleging that our independent curriculum contractors or teachers infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. A liability claim against us or any of our independent contractors, business partners, or teachers could adversely affect our reputation, enrollment and revenues. Even if unsuccessful, such a claim could create unfavorable publicity, cause us to incur substantial expenses and divert the time and attention of management.

We operate in markets that are dependent on Information Technology (IT) systems and technological change. Failure to maintain and support customer facing services, systems, and platforms, including addressing quality issues and execution on time of new products and enhancements, could negatively impact our revenues and reputation.

We use complex IT systems and products to support our business activities, including customer-facing systems, back-office processing and infrastructure. We face several technological risks associated with online product service delivery, information technology security (including virus and cyber-attacks), e-commerce and enterprise resource planning system implementation and upgrades. From time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our system by unauthorized parties, and our plans and procedures to reduce such risks may not be successful. Thus, our business could be adversely affected if our systems and infrastructure experience a significant failure or interruption in the event of future attacks on our system by unauthorized parties.

The failure to prevent a cybersecurity incident affecting our systems could result in the disruption of our services and the disclosure or misappropriation of sensitive information, which could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our services and products, expose us to liability, penalties, and remedial costs, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.

In order to provide our services and solutions, we depend on various information-technology systems, including those of third parties, to process, transmit, host and securely store electronic information, including confidential employee, customer, student, and parent information. Information-technology systems are at risk of being compromised, whether through malicious activity or human or technological error. Although we dedicate personnel and resources toward protecting against such cybersecurity risks, our efforts may fail to prevent a security incident.

For example, on December 1, 2020, we announced a security incident involving a ransomware attack. The incident resulted in the attacker accessing certain parts of our corporate back-office systems, including some student and employee information on those systems. We do not believe the incident will have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. We worked with our cyber insurance provider to make a payment to the ransomware attacker, as a proactive and preventive step to prevent the information obtained by the attacker from being released on the Internet or otherwise disclosed, although there is always a risk that the threat actor will not adhere to negotiated terms. Any remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to this security incident may be insufficient to prevent future attacks.

Any security incident that results in employee, customer, student, or parent information being accessed without authorization, or that otherwise disrupts or negatively impacts our operations, could harm our reputation, lead to customer attrition, and expose us to regulatory enforcement action or litigation. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources in response to a security breach, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, and incur expenses related to containing the incident and remediating our information security systems. Monetary damages and penalties and other costs or losses could be significant and may exceed insurance policy limits or may not be covered

## Table of Contents

by our insurance at all. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses.

## We rely on the Internet to enroll students and to deliver our products and services to children and to market ourselves and schools that contract with us, all of which exposes us to a growing number of legal risks and increasing regulation.

We collect information regarding students during the online enrollment process and a significant amount of our curriculum content is delivered over the Internet. As a result, specific federal, state and other jurisdictional laws that could have an impact on our business include the following:

- ● the COPPA, as implemented by regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (revised July 2013), imposes restrictions on the ability of online companies to collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13;
- ● the FERPA, which imposes parental or student consent requirements for specified disclosures of student information to third parties, and emerging state student data privacy laws;
- ● the CDA, which provides website operators immunity from most claims arising from the publication of third-party content;
- ● numerous state cyberbullying laws which require schools to adopt policies on harassment through the Internet or other electronic communications;
- ● rapidly emerging state student data privacy laws which require schools to adopt privacy policies and/or require certain contractual commitments from education technology providers are applicable to virtual schools and can significantly vary from one state to another;
- ● federal and state laws that govern schools' obligations to ELL students and students with disabilities; and
- ● the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which may apply to certain aspects of our Private Pay schools.

In addition, the laws applicable to the Internet are still developing. These laws impact pricing, advertising, taxation, consumer protection, quality of products and services, and are in a state of change. New or amended laws may also be enacted, which could increase the costs of regulatory compliance for us or force us to change our business practices. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations and indemnification of schools we operate for liabilities resulting from a school's failure to comply with such laws and regulations.

## Failure to comply with data privacy regulations could result in reputational damage to our brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information, whether through breach of our network or a vendor's network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by individuals. Failure to adequately protect personally identifiable information could potentially lead to penalties, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, the cancellation of existing contracts and difficulty in competing for future business. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with relevant laws and regulations regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information, which may be affected by any changes to data privacy legislation at both the federal and state levels. Because we serve students residing in foreign countries, we may be subject to privacy laws of other countries and regions, such as the GDPR. In addition to the possibility of penalties, remediation costs and reputational damage, the cost of compliance with foreign laws may outweigh revenue from those countries to such an extent that we may discontinue or restrict our offerings to certain countries.

## Table of Contents

We utilize a single logistics vendor for the management, receiving, assembly and shipping of all of our learning kits and printed educational materials. In addition, we utilize the same vendor at a second location for the reclamation and redeployment of our student computers. This partnership depends upon execution on the part of us and the vendor. Any material failure to execute properly for any reason, including damage or disruption to any of the vendor's facilities would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Substantially all of the inventory for our learning kits and printed materials is located in one warehouse facility, which is operated by a third-party logistics vendor that handles receipt, assembly and shipping of all physical learning materials. If this logistics vendor were to fail to meet its obligations to deliver learning materials to students in a timely manner, or if a material number of such shipments are incomplete or contain assembly errors, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide computers for a substantial number of our students. Execution or merger integration failures which interfere with the reclamation or redeployment of computers may result in additional costs. Furthermore, a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other unanticipated catastrophic event, especially during the period from April through June when we are awaiting receipt of most of the curriculum materials for the school year and have not yet shipped such materials to students, could significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any of our material inventory items were to experience any significant damage, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and our business would suffer.

## Any significant interruption in the operation of our data centers could cause a loss of data and disrupt our ability to manage our network hardware and software and technological infrastructure.

We host our products and serve all of our students from third-party data center facilities. As part of our risk mitigation plan, we opened a second data center in a different geographic location. Even with such redundancy, we may not be able to prevent a significant interruption in the operation of these facilities or the loss of school and operational data due to a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, act of terrorism or other unanticipated catastrophic event. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by our failure to successfully expand or upgrade our systems or manage our transition to utilizing the expansions or upgrades, could reduce our ability to manage our network and technological infrastructure, which could result in lost sales, enrollment terminations and impact our brand reputation.

Additionally, we do not control the operation of these facilities and must rely on another party to provide the physical security, facilities management and communications infrastructure services related to our data centers and our reliance on a single vendor exposes us to risks outside of our control. If this vendor encounters financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that causes it to fail to secure adequately and maintain its hosting facilities or provide the required data communications capacity, students of the schools we serve may experience interruptions in our service or the loss or theft of important customer data.

## Any significant interruption in the operation of our enrollment centers could disrupt our ability to recommend educational options to parents, respond to service requests and process enrollments.

Our primary enrollment center operations are housed in our corporate headquarters in Herndon, Virginia and in a facility located in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are able to reroute calls to the other facility if one facility is unable to temporarily service calls. Rerouting of calls may not be able to prevent a significant interruption in the operation of any of the facilities due to natural disasters, accidents, and failures of our fulfillment provider. Any significant interruption in the operation of any primary facility, including an interruption caused by our failure to successfully expand or upgrade our systems or to manage these expansions or upgrades, could reduce our ability to respond to service requests, receive and process orders and provide products and services, which could result in lost and cancelled sales, and damage to our brand reputation.

## Scale and capacity limits on some of our technology, transaction processing systems and network hardware and software may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems in a timely manner to meet significant unexpected increased demand.

As the number of schools we serve increases and our student base grows, the traffic on our transaction processing systems and network hardware and software will rise. In our capacity planning processes, we may be unable to accurately project the rate of increase in the use of our transaction processing systems and network hardware and software. In addition, we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate

## Table of Contents

significant unexpected increased or peak use. If we are unable to appropriately upgrade our systems and network hardware and software in a timely manner, our operations and processes may be temporarily disrupted.

## Our efforts to expand capacity may not produce the operational and financial results for which those investments were intended.

As we have grown to serve more schools, students and families in an increasing number of states and countries, we have invested in infrastructure systems and technology to keep pace such as new communication systems, enterprise hardware and software systems, and enrollment centers. In the absence of compatible business processes, adequate employee training, integration with other dependent systems, and sufficient staffing, this expanded capacity alone may not result in improved performance or outcomes.

## We may be unable to keep pace with changes in our industry and advancements in technology as our business and market strategy evolves.

As changes in our industry occur or macroeconomic conditions fluctuate we may need to adjust our business strategies or find it necessary to restructure our operations or businesses, which could lead to changes in our cost structure, the need to write down the value of assets, or impact our profitability. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in technology and expansion of our business lines. These investments may have short-term returns that are negative or less than expected and the ultimate business prospects of the business may be uncertain.

As our business and market strategy evolves, we also will need to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to remain competitive, such as the ubiquitous use of tablets for public school applications, adaptive learning technologies, and web accessibility standards. The need to respond to technological changes may require us to make substantial, unanticipated expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to respond successfully to technological change.

## We may be unable to attract and retain key executives and skilled employees, and because our employees are located throughout the United States, we may incur additional compliance and litigation costs that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and our results of operations.

Our success depends in large part on continued employment of senior management and key personnel who can effectively operate our business, which is necessary in the highly regulated public education sector involving a publicly traded for-profit company. This complexity requires us to attract and retain experienced executive management and employees with specialized skills and knowledge across many disciplines. If any of these employees leave us and we fail to effectively manage a transition to new personnel, or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and experienced professionals on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our success also depends on our having highly trained financial, technical, recruiting, sales and marketing personnel. We will need to continue to hire additional personnel as our business grows. A shortage in the number of people with these skills or our failure to attract them to our Company could impede our ability to increase revenues from our existing products and services, ensure full compliance with federal and state regulations, launch new product offerings, and would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and other state and federal employment laws. These laws govern such matters as minimum wage, overtime, leave, and other working conditions that can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. In addition, many state and local jurisdictions are adopting their own laws, such as paid sick leave, to address conditions of employment not covered by federal law and/or to provide additional rights and benefits to employees. These developments and disparate laws could increase our costs of doing business, lead to litigation, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

## We may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds will be available on acceptable terms.

We may need to raise additional funds in order to achieve growth or fund other business initiatives. This financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Additionally, any securities issued to raise funds may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures will be limited.

In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students also have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work-based learning experiences that are required to succeed in today's digital, tech-enabled economy. A student enrolled in a school offering Stride's General Education program may take Career Learning courses, but that student and the associated revenue is not reported as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue. However, a student and the associated revenue, whether in middle or high school, is counted as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue if the student is enrolled in a Career Learning program.

Like General Education products and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. We also offer focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, through our Galvanize, Inc. ("Galvanize"), Tech Elevator, Inc. ("Tech Elevator"), and MedCerts, LLC ("MedCerts") brands. These include skills training in the d ata science, software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers. T hese programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies.

For both the General Education and Career Learning markets, the majority of revenue is derived from our comprehensive school-as-a-service offering which includes an integrated package of curriculum, technology systems, instruction, and support services that we administer on behalf of our customers. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a negotiated time frame. During any fiscal year, we may enter into new agreements, receive non-automatic renewal notices, negotiate replacement agreements, terminate such agreements or receive notices of termination, or customers may transition a school to a different offering. For the 2020-2021 school year, we provided our school-as-a-service offering for 77 schools in 30 states and the District of Columbia in the General Education market, and 33 schools or programs in 23 states in the Career Learning market.

We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum, administration support and technology services to virtual and blended public schools. The amount of revenue generated from these contracts is impacted largely by the number of enrollments, the mix of enrollments across grades and states, state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirement, among other items. The average duration of the agreements for our school-as-a-service offering is greater than five years, and most provide for automatic renewals absent a customer notification within a negotiated time frame.

The two key financial metrics that we use to assess financial performance are revenues and operating income. During the year ended June 30, 2021, revenues increased to $1,536.8 million from $1,040.8 million in the prior year, an increase of 47.7%. Over the same period, operating income increased to $110.5 million from $32.5 million in the prior year, an increase of 240.0%. Our gross margin percentage is generally static so increases and decreases to our operating income are driven by revenue growth or a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Additionally, we use the non-financial metric of total enrollments to assess performance, as enrollment is a key driver of our revenues. Total enrollments for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 186.3 thousand, an increase of 65.4 thousand, or 54.1%, over the prior year.

While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, beginning

in late fiscal year 2020, we experienced an increase in demand for our products and services.

## Environmental, Social and Governance

As overseers of risk and stewards of long-term enterprise value, Stride's Board of Directors plays a vital role in assessing our organization's environmental and social impacts. They are also responsible for understanding the potential impact and related risks of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues on the organization's operating model. Our Board and management are committed to identifying those ESG issues most likely to impact business operations and growth. We craft policies that are appropriate for our industry and that are of concern to our employees, investors, customers and other key stakeholders. Our Board ensures that the Company's leaders have ample opportunity to leverage ESG for the long-term good of the organization, its stakeholders, and society. Each Committee of the Board monitors ESG efforts in their respective areas, with the Nominating and Governance Committee coordinating across all Committees.

Since our inception twenty years ago, we have removed barriers that impact academic equity. We provide high-quality education for anyone-particularly those in underserved communities-as a means to foster economic empowerment and address societal inequities from kindergarten all the way through college and career readiness. We recently reinforced our commitment in this area by launching several initiatives including initially offering scholarships to advance education and career opportunities for black students, expanding career pathways in socially responsible law enforcement and increasing employment of black teachers at Stridepowered schools. We are also designing interactive courses on the history of systemic racism that we will make available for free to every public school. On February 3, 2021, we convened a national forum of educational leaders focused on creating more equitable access to high-quality educational opportunities for students from underserved communities.

Among the many ESG issues we support within the Company, we endeavor to promote diversity and inclusion across every aspect of the organization. We sponsor employee resource groups to provide support for female, minority, differently abled, LGBTQ+, and veteran employees and support employee volunteer efforts. Our commitment is evident in the make-up of our leadership team. We have more minorities in executive management and more women in executive management than the representative population. Importantly, our Board of Directors is also diverse with female, Hispanic, and African American members.

Our commitment to ESG initiatives is an endeavor both the Board and management undertake for the general betterment of those both inside and outside of our Company.

The nature of our business supports environmental sustainability. Most of our employees work from home and most students at Stride-powered schools attend virtual classes, even prior to the COVID-19 crisis, reducing the carbon output from commuting in cars or buses. Our online curriculum reduces the need for paper. Our meetings are most often held virtually using digital first presentations rather than paper.

## Recent Developments

On January 26, 2021, we filed a Form 8-K to report that Nathaniel A. Davis, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as part of succession planning, notified our Board of Directors (the "Board") that he resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer, effective January 26, 2021. Mr. Davis will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Company. In addition, the Board appointed James J. Rhyu, formerly President, Corporate Strategy, Marketing and Technology, to succeed Mr. Davis as Chief Executive Officer, effective January 26, 2021.

On December 16, 2020, we changed our name from K12 Inc. to Stride, Inc.

On November 30, 2020, we acquired MedCerts in exchange for $70.0 million, plus estimated contingent consideration of $10.8 million. MedCerts students participate in online, hands-on career training courses in the healthcare and medical fields as they prepare for more than a dozen national healthcare certifications. The acquisition of MedCerts further expands the Company's postsecondary skills training in the healthcare and medical fields. The Company also plans to use MedCerts' curriculum to create appropriate content to offer high school students.

On November 30, 2020, we acquired Tech Elevator in exchange for $23.5 million, plus working capital. Like Galvanize, Tech Elevator provides talent development for individuals and enterprises in information technology fields. The acquisition of Tech Elevator expands Galvanize's student demographic profile, geographic footprint, and hiring

partner portfolio; as well as provides additional curriculum to create appropriate content to offer high school students.

## Key Aspects and Trends of Our Operations

## Revenues-Overview

We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum, administration support and technology services to virtual and blended public schools. We anticipate that these revenues will continue to represent the majority of our total revenues over the next several years. However, we also expect revenues in other aspects of our business to continue to increase as we execute on our growth strategy. Our growth strategy includes increasing revenues in other distribution channels, expanding our adult learning training programs, adding enrollments in our private schools, and expanding our learning solutions sales channel. Combined revenues from these other sectors were significantly smaller than those from the virtual and blended public schools we serve in the year ended June 30, 2021. Our success in executing our strategies will impact future growth. We have several sales channels from which we generate revenues that are discussed in more detail below.

Factors affecting our revenues include:

- (i) the number of enrollments;
- (ii) the mix of enrollments across grades and states;
- (iii) administrative services and curriculum sales provided to the schools and school districts;
- (iv) state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirements;
- (v) prices for our products and services;
- (vi) growth in our adult learning programs; and
- (vii) revenues from new initiatives, mergers and acquisitions.

## Virtual and Blended Schools

The virtual and blended schools we serve offer an integrated package of systems, services, products, and professional expertise that we administer to support a virtual or blended public school. Customers of these programs can obtain the administrative support, information technology, academic support services, online curriculum, learning system platforms and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service and product agreement. We provide our school-as-a-service offerings to virtual and blended public charter schools and school districts.

We define an enrollment as any student enrolled in a full service virtual or blended public school where we provide a combination of curriculum, technology, instructional and support services inclusive of administrative support. Generally, students will take four to six courses, except for some kindergarten students who may participate in half-day programs. We count each half-day kindergarten student as an enrollment. School sessions generally begin in August or September and end in May or June. To ensure that all schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments, we consider the number of students on the first Wednesday of October to be our opening enrollment level, and the number of students enrolled on the last day of May to be our ending enrollment level. For each period, average enrollments represent the average of the month-end enrollment levels for each school month in the period. We continually evaluate our enrollment levels by state, by school and by grade. We track new student enrollments and withdrawals throughout the year.

We believe that our revenue growth from enrollments depends upon the following:

- ● the number of states and school districts in which we operate;
- ● the mix of students served;

## Table of Contents

- ● the restrictive terms of local laws or regulations, including enrollment caps;
- ● the appeal of our curriculum and instructional model to students and families;
- ● the specific school or school district requirements including credit recovery or special needs;
- ● the effectiveness of our program in delivering favorable academic outcomes;
- ● the quality of the teachers working in the schools we serve;
- ● the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting programs to attract new enrollments; and
- ● retention of students through successive grade levels.

We continually evaluate our trends in revenues by monitoring the number of student enrollments in total, by state, by school and by grade, assessing the impact of changes in school funding levels, school mix (distribution of enrollments by school), changes in state funding rates and higher utilization in federal and state restricted funding per student, and the pricing of our curriculum and educational services.

Enrollments in virtual and blended schools on average generate substantially more revenues than enrollments served through our other sales channels where we provide limited or no administrative services.

## Learning Solutions

Our Learning Solutions sales channel distributes our software and services to schools and school districts across the U.S. Over the past few years, public schools and school districts have been increasingly adopting online solutions to augment teaching practices, launch new learning models, cost-effectively expand course offerings, provide schedule flexibility, improve student engagement, increase graduation rates, replace textbooks, and retain students. State education funds traditionally allocated for textbook and print materials have also been authorized for the purchase of digital content, including online courses, and in some cases mandated access to online courses. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, school districts are seeking more complete virtual learning solutions in addition to curriculum, including virtual instructional delivery, scheduling, attendance monitoring for virtual instructional sessions, teacher professional development, consulting support in effective virtual instruction, and special education accommodations. Additionally, districts are seeking support for implementations that blend virtual and in-person instruction.

To address the growing need for digital solutions and the recently emerging need for comprehensive virtual solutions, our Learning Solutions team provides curriculum and technology solutions, packaged in a portfolio of flexible learning and delivery models mapped to specific student and/or district needs. This portfolio approach provides a continuum of delivery models, from fulltime programs to individual course sales and supplemental options that can be used in traditional classrooms to differentiate instruction. Our Learning Solutions team strives to partner with public schools and school districts, primarily in the U.S., to provide more options and better tools to empower teachers to improve student achievement through personalized learning in traditional, blended and online learning environments and to provide comprehensive support for teachers and administrators to deliver effective virtual and blended instructions.

Sales opportunities are driven by a number of factors in a diverse customer population, which determine the deliverable and price. These factors include:

- ● Type of Customer -A customer can be a public school district, private school, charter school, early childhood learning center or corporate partner.
- ● Curriculum Needs -We sell our curriculum solutions based on the scope of the customer need, and a solution is generally purchased as end-user access to a complete catalog, individual course or supplemental content title.
- ● License Options -Depending on the scope of the solution, a license can be purchased for individual course enrollments, annual seat, school or district-wide site licenses or a perpetual license (a prepaid lifetime license). We may charge incrementally if we are hosting the solution.
- ● Hosting -Customers may host curricula themselves or license our hosted solution. We are able to track all students for customers who use our hosted solution. However, more often in large-scale, district-wide implementations, a customer may choose to host the curriculum, and in that case, we have no visibility of individual student usage for counting enrollments.

## Table of Contents

- ● Services Menu -Instructional services may be provided and priced per-enrollment or bundled in the overall price of the solution. Additional services, including professional development, title maintenance and support may also be provided and are priced based on the scope of services.

## Private Schools

Private schools are schools where tuition is paid directly by the family of the student. We receive no public funds for students in our private schools. We operate three accredited private online schools at differing price points and service levels. We define an enrollment as any student enrolled in one of these schools where we provide a combination of curriculum, technology, instructional and support services inclusive of administrative support. Our revenues are derived from tuition receipts that are a function of course enrollments and program price. In some circumstances, a third-party school may elect to enroll one of its students in a Stride private school course as a supplement to the student's regular on-campus instruction. In such cases, the third-party school may pay the Stride private school tuition. We have entered into agreements that enable us to distribute our products and services to our international school partners who use our courses to provide electives offerings and dual diploma programs.

We believe our revenue growth depends primarily on the recruitment of students into our programs through effective marketing and word-of-mouth referral based on the quality of our service. In addition, through high service quality, we seek to retain existing students and increase the total number of courses each student takes with us. In some cases, students return each summer and take only one course. In other cases, students choose a Stride private school as their principal form of education and may stay for many years. The flexibility of our programs, the quality of our curriculum and teaching, and the student community features lead to customer satisfaction and therefore, retention.

## Consumer Sales

We also sell individual K-8 online courses and supplemental educational products directly to families. These purchasers desire to educate their children as homeschoolers, outside of the traditional school system or to supplement their child's existing public or private school education without the aid of an online teacher. Customers of our consumer products have the option of purchasing a complete grade-level curriculum for grades K-8, individual courses, or a variety of other supplemental products, covering various subjects depending on their child's needs. Typical applications include summer school course work, home-schooling and educational supplements.

Similar to our private schools, we believe our revenue growth depends primarily on the recruitment of students into our programs through effective marketing and word-of-mouth referral based on the quality of our service.

## Adult Learning

We offer adult learning training programs through three brands, Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts, which provide programs that address the skills gap facing companies in the information technology and health care sectors. Galvanize and Tech Elevator offer in-person and remote immersive full-time programs designed for adult learners looking to advance their technology careers by providing such learners with skills and real-world experiences. These programs are offered in software engineering and data science. MedCerts provides self-paced, fully online structured training programs that lead to certifications in the health care field. In many cases, Galvanize, Tech Elevator, and MedCerts work directly with a company to create a customized, tailored education plan to help the company reach its goals and train its employees according to such plan.

We believe that revenue growth in our adult learning brands depends on our ability to identify and attract prospective learners through various marketing channels. Continued growth in these brands will also require that we demonstrate success in placing these learners in jobs following their completion of the program.

## Instructional Costs and Services Expenses

Instructional costs and services expenses include expenses directly attributable to the educational products and services we provide. The public schools we administer are the primary drivers of these costs, including teacher and administrator salaries and benefits and expenses of related support services. We also employ teachers and administrators for instruction and oversight in Learning Solutions and Private Schools. Instructional costs also include fulfillment costs of student textbooks and materials, depreciation and reclamation costs of computers provided for student use, the cost of

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

any third-party online courses and the amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems. Our instructional costs are variable and are based directly on our number of schools and enrollments.

Our high school offering requires increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our kindergarten to 8th grade offering. This is due to the following: (i) generally lower student-to-teacher ratios; (ii) higher compensation costs for some teaching positions requiring subject-matter expertise; (iii) ancillary costs for required student support services, including college placement, SAT preparation and guidance counseling; (iv) use of third-party courses to augment our proprietary curriculum; and (v) use of a third-party learning management system to service high school students. Over time, we may partially offset these factors by obtaining productivity gains in our high school instructional model, replacing third-party high school courses with proprietary content, replacing our third-party learning management system with another third-party system, leveraging our school infrastructure and obtaining purchasing economies of scale.

We have deployed and are continuing to develop new delivery models, including blended schools, where students receive limited face-to-face instruction in a learning center to complement their online instruction, and other programs that utilize brick and mortar facilities. The maintenance, management and operations of these facilities necessitate additional costs, which are generally not required to operate typical virtual public schools. We are pursuing expansion into new states for both virtual public and other specialized charter schools. If we are successful, we will incur start-up costs and other expenses associated with the initial launch of a school, including the funding of building leases and leasehold improvements.

## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses include the salaries and benefits of employees engaged in business development, public affairs, sales and marketing, and administrative functions, and transaction and due diligence expenses related to mergers and acquisitions.

Also included are product development expenses which include research and development costs and overhead costs associated with the management of both our curriculum development and internal systems development teams. In addition, product development expenses include the amortization of internal systems. We measure and track our product development expenditures on a per course or project basis to measure and assess our development efficiency. In addition, we monitor employee utilization rates to evaluate our workforce efficiency. We plan to continue to invest in additional curriculum development and related software in the future. We capitalize selected costs incurred to develop our curriculum, beginning with application development, through production and testing into capitalized curriculum development costs. We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop internal systems into capitalized software development costs.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

## Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services using the following steps:

- ● identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
- ● identify the performance obligations in the contract;
- ● determine the transaction price;

## Table of Contents

- ● allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
- ● recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

Revenues related to the products and services that we provide to students in kindergarten through twelfth grade or adult learners are considered to be General Education or Career Learning based on the school or adult program in which the student is enrolled. General Education products and services are focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, in-demand industries-including information technology, business, and health services, for students in middle school through high school and adult learners.

The majority of our contracts are with the following types of customers:

- ● a virtual or blended school whereby the amount of revenue is primarily determined by funding the school receives;
- ● a school or individual who licenses certain curriculum on a subscription or course-by-course basis; or
- ● an enterprise who contracts with the Company to provide job training.

## Funding-based Contracts

We provide an integrated package of systems, services, products, and professional expertise that is administered together to support a virtual or blended public school. Contractual agreements generally span multiple years with performance obligations being isolated to annual periods which generally coincide with our fiscal year. Customers of these programs can obtain administrative support, information technology, academic support services, online curriculum, learning systems platforms and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service agreement. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the state in which the public school or school district is located. Shipments of materials for schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter and for the upcoming school year are recorded in deferred revenue.

We generate revenues under contracts with virtual and blended public schools and include the following components, where required:

- ● providing each of a school's students with access to our online school and lessons;
- ● offline learning kits, which include books and materials to supplement the online lessons;
- ● the use of a personal computer and associated reclamation services;
- ● internet access and technology support services;
- ● instruction by a state-certified teacher; and
- ● management and technology services necessary to support a virtual or blended school. In certain contracts, revenues are determined directly by per enrollment funding.

To determine the pro rata amount of revenue to recognize in a fiscal quarter, we estimate the total expected funds each school will receive in a particular school year. Total funds for a school are primarily a function of the number of students enrolled in the school and established per enrollment funding levels, which are generally published on an annual basis by the state or school district. We review its estimates of funding periodically, and updates as necessary, by adjusting its year-to-date earned revenues to be proportional to the total expected revenues to be earned during the fiscal year. Actual school funding may vary from these estimates and the impact of these differences could impact our results of operations. Since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year, annual revenues are generally based on actual school funding and actual costs incurred (including costs for our services to the schools plus other costs the schools may incur). Our schools' reported results are subject to annual school district financial audits, which incorporate enrollment counts, funding and other routine financial audit considerations. The results of these audits are incorporated into the Company's monthly funding estimates for the current and prior periods. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's aggregate funding estimates differed from actual reimbursements impacting total reported revenue by approximately (0.1)%, 0.6%, and 0.4%, respectively.

Each state and/or school district has variations in the school funding formulas and methodologies that it uses to estimate funding for revenue recognition at its respective schools. As the Company estimates funding for each school, it takes into account the state definition for count dates on which reported enrollment numbers will be used for per pupil

## Table of Contents

funding. The parameters the Company considers in estimating funding for revenue recognition purposes include school district count definitions, withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, academic progress and historical completion, student location, funding caps and other state specified categorical program funding.

Under the contracts where we provide products and services to schools, we are responsible for substantially all of the expenses incurred by the school and have generally agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools in a given school year. These school operating losses represent the excess of costs incurred over revenues earned by the virtual or blended public school (the school's expected funding), as reflected in its respective financial statements, including our charges to the schools. To the extent a school does not receive sufficient funding for each student enrolled in the school, the school would still incur costs associated with serving the unfunded enrollment. If losses due to unfunded enrollments result in a net operating loss for the year that loss is reflected as a reduction in the revenues and net receivables that we collect from the school. A school net operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean we anticipate losing money on the entire contract with the school. However, a school's net operating loss may reduce our ability to collect its management fees in full and recognized revenues are constrained to reflect the expected cash collections from such schools. We record the school's estimated net operating loss against revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year. Actual school net operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions, and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on results of operations.

## Subscription-based Contracts

We provide certain online curriculum and services to schools and school districts under subscription agreements. Revenues from the licensing of curriculum under subscription arrangements are recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Revenues from professional consulting, training and support services are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period.

In addition, we contract with individual customers who have access for one to two years to company-provided online curriculum and generally prepay for services to be received. Adult learners enroll in courses that provide specialized training in a specific industry. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. We recognize these revenues pro rata over the maximum term of the customer contract based on the defined contract price.

## Enterprise Contracts

We provide job training over a specified contract period to enterprises. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. We recognize these revenues based on the number of students trained during the term of the contract based on the defined contract price.

## Income Taxes

Accounting for income taxes prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts, using currently enacted tax laws. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established, based on the weight of available evidence, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income. We exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets.

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. We periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Changes in income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels, among other things, could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods.

We have a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of $5.0 million and $5.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the amount that will likely not be realized.

## Results of Operations

## Impact of COVID-19 to Stride's Business

While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, beginning in late fiscal year 2020, we experienced an increase in demand for our products and services.

We continue to conduct business as usual with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain events. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects, or on our long-term financial results.

## Lines of Revenue

We operate in one operating and reportable business segment as a technology-based education company providing proprietary and third-party curriculum, software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates profitability based on consolidated results. We have two lines of revenue: (i) General Education and (ii) Career Learning. Our previous lines of revenue were (i) Managed Public School Programs, (ii) Institutional, and (ii) Private Pay Schools and Other. The prior year comparable enrollment and revenue data has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Additionally, we have provided a reconciliation of the prior lines of revenue to the current lines of revenue for both the enrollment and revenue data to facilitate a period-over-period comparison. We believe that the change in the lines of revenue will facilitate a better understanding of the markets in which we compete.

## Enrollment Data

The following table sets forth total enrollment data for students in our General Education and Career Learning lines of revenue. Enrollments for General Education and Career Learning only include those students in full service public or private programs where Stride provides a combination of curriculum, technology, instructional and support services inclusive of administrative support. No enrollments are included in Career Learning for Galvanize, Tech Elevator or MedCerts. This data includes enrollments for which Stride receives no public funding or revenue.

If the mix of enrollments changes, our revenues will be impacted to the extent the average revenue per enrollment is significantly different. We do not award or permit incentive compensation to be paid to our public school program enrollment staff or contractors based on the number of students enrolled.

## Reconciliation of Prior and Current Enrollment

The following is a reconciliation of our prior reporting structure to our current reporting structure for each of the periods indicated:

## Revenue Data

Revenues are captured by market based on the underlying customer contractual agreements. Where customers purchase products and services for both General Education and Career Learning markets we allocate revenues based on the program each student selects for enrollment. All kindergarten through fifth grade students are considered General Education students. Periodically, a middle school or high school student enrollment may change line of revenue classification.

## Comparison of the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020

Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $1,536.8 million, representing an increase of $496.0 million, or 47.7%, from $1,040.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. General Education revenues increased $346.4 million, or 37.1%, year over year. The increase in General Education revenues was primarily due to the 45.4% increase in enrollments, school mix (distribution of enrollments by school), and other factors. Career Learning revenues increased $149.6 million, or 139.9%, primarily due to a 126.0% increase in enrollments, school mix, as well as from the acquisitions of Galvanize, MedCerts and Tech Elevator.

Instructional costs and services expenses. Instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $1,001.9 million, representing an increase of $308.7 million, or 44.5%, from $693.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. This increase in expense was primarily associated with the incremental personnel and related benefit costs associated with supporting higher enrollments, as well as costs associated with serving Galvanize's customers. Instructional costs and services expenses were 65.2% of revenues during the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease from 66.6% for the year ended June 30, 2020.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $424.4 million, representing an increase of $109.3 million, or 34.7% from $315.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $39.9 million in personnel and related benefit costs, $26.4 million in professional services expenses, $18.8 million in licensing fees, and $15.7 million in stock-based compensation. The increase in personnel and related benefit costs was partially related to the additional headcount of MedCerts and Tech Elevator, as well as a full year of headcount related to Galvanize. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 27.6% of revenues during the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease from 30.3% for the year ended June 30, 2020.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was $24.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, or 25.6% of income before taxes, as compared to $8.5 million, or 25.8% of income before taxes for the year ended June 30, 2020.

## Comparison of the Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019

Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended June 30, 2020 were $1,040.8 million, representing an increase of $25.0 million, or 2.5%, from $1,015.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. General Education revenues decreased

## Table of Contents

$32.1 million, or 3.3%, year over year. The decrease in General Education revenues was primarily due to the 3.1% decrease in enrollments and other factors. Career Learning revenues increased $57.1 million, or 114.7%, primarily due to an increase in enrollment and school mix, as well as from the acquisition of Galvanize.

Instructional costs and services expenses. Instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 were $693.2 million, representing an increase of $29.8 million, or 4.5%, from $663.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. This increase in expense was primarily due to the incremental personnel and related benefit costs due to supporting higher enrollments, as well as costs associated with serving Galvanize's customers. Instructional costs and service expenses were 66.6% of revenues during the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase from 65.3% for the year ended June 30, 2019.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 were $315.1 million, representing an increase of $8.3 million, or 2.7%, from $306.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in professional services. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 30.3% of revenues during the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase from 30.2% for the year ended June 30, 2019.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was $8.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, or 25.8% of income before taxes, as compared to a benefit of $10.5 million, or 22.0% of income before taxes for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to the increase in the amount of non-deductible compensation, which was partially offset by the increase in excess tax benefit of stock-based compensation.

## Discussion of Seasonality of Financial Condition

Certain accounts in our balance sheet are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As our enrollments and revenues grow, we expect these seasonal trends to be amplified. The bulk of our materials are shipped to students prior to the beginning of the school year, usually in July or August. In order to prepare for the upcoming school year, we generally build up inventories during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Therefore, inventories tend to be at the highest levels at the end of our fiscal year. In the first quarter of our fiscal year, inventories tend to decline significantly as materials are shipped to students. In our fourth quarter, inventory purchases and the extent to which we utilize early payment discounts will impact the level of accounts payable.

Accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter of our fiscal year as we begin billing for all enrolled students and our billing arrangements include upfront fees for many of the elements of our offering. These upfront fees result in seasonal fluctuations to our deferred revenue balances. We routinely monitor state legislative activity and regulatory proceedings that might impact the funding received by the schools we serve and to the extent possible, factor potential outcomes into our business planning decisions.

The deferred revenue related to our direct-to-consumer business results from advance payments for twelve month subscriptions to our online school. These advance payments are amortized over the life of the subscription and tend to be highest at the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter, when the majority of subscriptions are sold.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2021, we had net working capital, or current assets minus current liabilities, of $551.3 million. Our working capital includes cash and cash equivalents of $386.1 million and accounts receivable of $369.3 million. Our working capital provides a significant source of liquidity for our normal operating needs. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the fiscal year based on the timing of customer billings and collections and tends to be highest in our first fiscal quarter as we begin billing for students. In addition, our cash and accounts receivable were significantly in excess of our accounts payable and short-term accrued liabilities at June 30, 2021.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we issued $420.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 ("Notes"). The Notes are governed by an indenture (the "Indenture") between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $408.6 million after deducting the underwriting fees and other expenses paid by the Company. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.125% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 $^{st}$ and September 1$^{st}$ of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on September 1, 2027. In connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions") with certain counterparties. The Capped Call

## Table of Contents

Transactions are expected to cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The upper strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $86.174 per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was $60.4 million and was recorded within additional paid-in capital.

Before June 1, 2027, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. After June 1, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until two days prior to the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying cash up to the outstanding principal amount, and at our election, will settle the conversion spread by paying or delivering cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The initial conversion rate is 18.9109 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $52.88 per share of common stock. The Notes will be redeemable at our option at any time after September 6, 2024 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain stock price hurdles as discussed in the Indenture.

On January 27, 2020, we entered into a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") to be used for general corporate operating purposes with PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Credit Facility has a five-year term and incorporates customary financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The majority of our borrowings under the Credit Facility were at LIBOR plus an additional rate ranging from 0.875% - 1.50% based on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facility is secured by our assets. The Credit Facility agreement allows for an amendment to establish a new benchmark interest rate when LIBOR is discontinued during the five-year term. As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. As part of the proceeds received from the Notes, we repaid our $100.0 million outstanding balance and as of June 30, 2021, we had no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also includes a $200.0 million accordion feature.

We are a lessee under finance lease obligations for student computers and peripherals under loan agreements with PNC Equipment Finance, LLC ("PNC") and Banc of America Leasing & Capital, LLC ("BALC"). As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the finance lease liability was $68.9 million and $17.9 million, respectively, with lease interest rates ranging from 1.52% to 3.87%.

Individual leases under the agreement with PNC include 36-month payment terms at varying rates, with a $1 purchase option at the end of each lease term. We have pledged the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases.

We entered into an agreement with BALC in April 2020 for $25.0 million (increased to $41.0 million in July 2020) to provide financing for our leases through March 2021 at varying rates. We entered into additional agreements during fiscal year 2021 to provide financing of $54.0 million for our student computers and peripherals leases through October 2021 at varying rates. Individual leases with BALC include 12-month and 36-month payment terms, fixed rates ranging from 1.52% to 2.58%, and a $1 purchase option at the end of each lease term. We pledged the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases.

Our cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses, capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to interest on our Notes, office facility leases, capital equipment leases and other operating leases. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We believe that the combination of funds to be generated from operations, proceeds from our Notes, borrowing on our Credit Facility and net working capital on hand will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, we continue to explore acquisitions, strategic investments and joint ventures related to our business that we may acquire using cash, stock, debt, contribution of assets or a combination thereof.

## Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $134.2 million compared to $80.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The $53.8 million increase in cash provided by operations between periods was primarily due to an increase in net income including non-cash adjustments partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $56.8 million. The decrease in other assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, and inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets; partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits. The increase in accounts receivable was related to the increase in revenue with schools with payment terms

that extend beyond our fiscal year, while the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was related to an increase in our corporate bonus and accrued salaries.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $80.4 million compared to $141.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $61.2 million decrease in cash provided by operations between periods was primarily due to a decrease in working capital of $63.3 million. The decrease in other assets and liabilities was primarily due to decreases in accounts payable, as well as increases in accounts receivable, and inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $141.6 million compared to $105.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. The $36.2 million increase in cash provided by operations between periods was primarily due to an increase in net income and an increase in working capital of $25.3 million. The increase in other assets and liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as a decrease in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

## Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $165.4 million, $217.4 million and $61.1 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 decreased $52.0 million from the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Galvanize during the year ended June 30, 2020 being more than the acquisitions of MedCerts and Tech Elevator during the year ended June 30, 2021 and purchases of marketable securities of $40.5 million.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased $156.3 million from the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Galvanize of $165.0 million, plus working capital, net of cash.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 increased $10.6 million from the year ended June 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in capitalized expenditures of $5.3 million and our $11.7 million investment in Tallo in the year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the $4.0 million investment in Modern Teacher and the $2.8 million investment in Big Universe in the year ended June 30, 2018.

## Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $204.6 million and $65.6 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 was $29.0 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased $139.0 million from the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of our Notes of $408.6 million, partially offset by capped call purchases related to the Notes of $60.4 million and the repayment of our Credit Facility of $100.0 million. The net increase was partially offset by the net proceeds from our Credit Facility during the year ended June 30, 2020.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased $94.6 million from net cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase from net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to borrowings from the Credit Facility of $105.0 million partially offset by an increase in the repayment of finance lease obligations incurred for the acquisition of student computers of $6.6 million.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2019 decreased $23.7 million from the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to stock repurchases of $27.5 million in the year ended June 30, 2018.

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

## Interest Rate Risk

At June 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $386.1 million and $212.3 million, respectively. Our excess cash has been invested in money market funds, government securities, corporate debt securities and similar investments. Future interest and investment income are subject to the impact of interest rate changes, and we may be subject to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. At June 30, 2021, a 1% gross increase in interest rates earned on cash would result in a $3.9 million annualized increase in interest income.

Our short-term debt obligations under our Credit Facility are subject to interest rate exposure. At June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding balance on our Credit Facility.

## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We currently operate in several foreign countries, but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency. If we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operations in a foreign currency, we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and/or currency translation risk. Exchange rates between U.S. dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations.

## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stride, Inc. (the "Company") as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of July 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases .

## Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

## Revenues from Funding-based Contracts

As described in Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, for the year ended June 30, 2021, revenues from funding-based contracts approximated $1,323 million and contributed to both lines of revenue-General Education and Career Learning. The computation of funding-based contract revenue from state sources is based upon the amount of estimated funding expected to be provided by the state where the public school or school district is located. Total estimated funding from all sources represents the maximum value of revenue to be recognized from funding-based contracts and is adjusted as necessary for individual school financial deficits and surpluses.

We identified management's judgments related to revenues from funding-based contracts as a critical audit matter. The critical input used to calculate state estimated funding is enrollment, which is defined by the state governing authorities, varies by school and by funding metric, and often requires management to perform complex calculations subject to the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Assumptions and inputs used to determine enrollment figures may include withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, academic progress, historical completion rate, and student location among others. Changes to these inputs and assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of expected annual funding, and thus revenues recognized. Auditing enrollment figures involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to properly address inputs within the enrollment figures related to funding-based contracts.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

- ● Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the determination of enrollment figures including the monthly review of projected student counts and review of schools' funding calculations. These controls include review of the reasonableness of assumptions used and the appropriateness of methodologies used to determine enrollment figures pursuant to the Company's interpretation of the states' enrollment definitions.
- ● Testing the completeness, existence, and accuracy of enrollment calculations by validating a sample of underlying student data and assumptions used as inputs through the inspection of relevant source documents including admission records, student transcripts and/or report cards, and third-party support.
- ● Testing the Company's computations of enrollment figures and state estimated funding for a sample of schools through recalculating the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
- ● Performing a retrospective review of funding on a school by school basis and investigating variances outside of predetermined thresholds through the inspection of relevant source documents.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

## 1. Description of the Business

Stride, Inc., together with its subsidiaries ("Stride" or the "Company") is an education services company providing virtual and blended learning. On December 16, 2020, the Company changed its name from K12 Inc. to Stride, Inc. The brand reflects the Company's continued growth into lifelong learning, regardless of a student's age or location. The Company's technology-based products and services enable its clients to attract, enroll, educate, track progress, and support students. These products and services, spanning curriculum, systems, instruction, and support services are designed to help learners of all ages reach their full potential through inspired teaching and personalized learning. The Company's clients are primarily public and private schools, school districts, and charter boards. Additionally, it offers solutions to employers, government agencies and consumers. These products and services are provided through two lines of revenue:

- ● Products and services for the General Education market are predominantly focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Programs utilizing General Education products and services are for students that are not specializing in any particular curriculum or course of study. These programs provide an alternative to traditional school options and address a range of student needs including, safety concerns, increased academic support, scheduling flexibility, physical/health restrictions or advanced learning. Products and services are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte.
- ● Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, indemand industries-including information technology, health care and business. The Company provides middle and high school students with Career Learning programs that complement their core general education coursework in math, English, science and history. Stride offers multiple career pathways supported by a diverse catalog of Career Learning courses. The middle school program exposes students to a variety of career options and introduces career skill development. In high school, students may engage in industry content pathway courses, project-based learning in virtual teams, and career development services. High school students also have the opportunity to progress toward certifications, connect with industry professionals, earn college credits while in high school, and participate in job shadowing and/or work-based learning experiences that are required to succeed in today's digital, tech-enabled economy. A student enrolled in a school offering Stride's General Education program may take Career Learning courses, but that student and the associated revenue is not reported as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue. However, a student and the associated revenue, whether in middle or high school, is counted as a Career Learning enrollment or Career Learning revenue if the student is enrolled in a Career Learning program. Like General Education products and services, the products and services for the Career Learning market are sold as a comprehensive school-as-a-service offering or à la carte. The Company also offers focused post-secondary career learning programs to adult learners, through its Galvanize, Inc. ("Galvanize"), Tech Elevator, Inc. ("Tech Elevator"), and MedCerts, LLC ("MedCerts") brands. These include skills training inthe data science, software engineering, healthcare, and medical fields, as well as providing staffing and talent development services to employers. These programs are offered directly to consumers, as well as to employers and government agencies.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company revised its lines of revenue. Previously, the lines of revenue were (i) Managed Public School Programs, (ii) Institutional, and (iii) Private Pay Schools and Other. The Company believes that the change in the lines of revenue will facilitate a better understanding of the markets in which the Company competes.

individualized learning for students and adults. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates profitability based on consolidated results.

## 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## Accounting Standards Adopted

On July 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses ("ASC 326"), related to the methodology for recognizing credit losses. The new standard revises the accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses. Assets must be presented in the financial statements as the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance is based upon historical losses, customer-specific information, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASC 326 resulted in the recognition of an additional allowance for credit losses of $8.5 million, as well as decreases of $6.2 million and $2.3 million to retained earnings and deferred tax liabilities, respectively, as of July 1, 2020.

On July 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) ("ASU 2017-04"). This amendment simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. The Company adopted this standard prospectively without a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.

## Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) ("ASU 2020-04") which provides relief to companies that will be impacted by the cessation of reference rate reform, e.g. LIBOR, that is tentatively planned for the end of calendar year 2022. The ASU permits an entity to consider contract modifications due to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require contract remeasurement. This ASU will be effective for the Company as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and adoption is permitted at any time during the period on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) which, among other things, simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate conversion features from the host contract. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and interest expense will be recognized at the coupon rate. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods. The Company early adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The adoption resulted in the elimination of the debt discount (and related deferred tax liability) that had been recorded within equity. The net impact of the adjustments will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Preliminarily, the impacts to the consolidated balance sheet were the following: (1) increase of $110.6 million to long-term debt, (2) decrease of $89.4 million to additional paid-in capital, (3) decrease of $29.4 million to deferred tax liability, and (4) increase to retained earnings of$8.2 million.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts

## Table of Contents

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, amortization periods, the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of net assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, fair values used in asset impairment evaluations, valuation of long-lived assets, accrual for incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims, contingencies, income taxes, fair value of contingent consideration and stock-based compensation expense. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of the analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services using the following steps:

- ● identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
- ● identify the performance obligations in the contract;
- ● determine the transaction price;
- ● allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
- ● recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

Revenues related to the products and services that the Company provides to students in kindergarten through twelfth grade or adult learners are considered to be General Education or Career Learning based on the school or adult program in which the student is enrolled. General Education products and services are focused on core subjects, including math, English, science and history, for kindergarten through twelfth grade students to help build a common foundation of knowledge. Career Learning products and services are focused on developing skills to enter and succeed in careers in high-growth, in-demand industries-including information technology, business, and health services, for students in middle school through high school and adult learners.

The majority of the Company's contracts are with the following types of customers:

- ● a virtual or blended school whereby the amount of revenue is primarily determined by funding the school receives;
- ● a school or individual who licenses certain curriculum on a subscription or course-by-course basis; or
- ● an enterprise who contracts with the Company to provide job training.

## Funding-based Contracts

The Company provides an integrated package of systems, services, products, and professional expertise that is administered together to support a virtual or blended public school. Contractual agreements generally span multiple years with performance obligations being isolated to annual periods which generally coincide with the Company's fiscal year. Customers of these programs can obtain administrative support, information technology, academic support services, online curriculum, learning systems platforms and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service agreement. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the state in which the public school or school district is located. Shipments of materials for schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter and for the upcoming school year are recorded in deferred revenue.

The Company generates revenues under contracts with virtual and blended public schools and include the following components, where required:

- ● providing each of a school's students with access to the Company's online school and lessons;
- ● offline learning kits, which include books and materials to supplement the online lessons;

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

- ● the use of a personal computer and associated reclamation services;
- ● internet access and technology support services;
- ● instruction by a state-certified teacher; and
- ● management and technology services necessary to support a virtual or blended school. In certain contracts, revenues are determined directly by per enrollment funding.

To determine the pro rata amount of revenue to recognize in a fiscal quarter, the Company estimates the total expected funds each school will receive in a particular school year. Total funds for a school are primarily a function of the number of students enrolled in the school and established per enrollment funding levels, which are generally published on an annual basis by the state or school district. The Company reviews its estimates of funding periodically, and updates as necessary, by adjusting its year-to-date earned revenues to be proportional to the total expected revenues to be earned during the fiscal year. Actual school funding may vary from these estimates and the impact of these differences could impact the Company's results of operations. Since the end of the school year coincides with the end of the Company's fiscal year, annual revenues are generally based on actual school funding and actual costs incurred (including costs for the Company's services to the schools plus other costs the schools may incur). The Company's schools' reported results are subject to annual school district financial audits, which incorporate enrollment counts, funding and other routine financial audit considerations. The results of these audits are incorporated into the Company's monthly funding estimates for the current and prior periods. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's aggregate funding estimates differed from actual reimbursements impacting total reported revenue by approximately (0.1)%, 0.6%, and 0.4%, respectively.

Each state and/or school district has variations in the school funding formulas and methodologies that it uses to estimate funding for revenue recognition at its respective schools. As the Company estimates funding for each school, it takes into account the state definition for count dates on which reported enrollment numbers will be used for per pupil funding. The parameters the Company considers in estimating funding for revenue recognition purposes include school district count definitions, withdrawal rates, new registrations, average daily attendance, special needs enrollment, academic progress and historical completion, student location, funding caps and other state specified categorical program funding.

Under the contracts where the Company provides products and services to schools, the Company is responsible for substantially all of the expenses incurred by the school and has generally agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools in a given school year. These school operating losses represent the excess of costs incurred over revenues earned by the virtual or blended public school (the school's expected funding), as reflected in its respective financial statements, including Company charges to the schools. To the extent a school does not receive sufficient funding for each student enrolled in the school, the school would still incur costs associated with serving the unfunded enrollment. If losses due to unfunded enrollments result in a net operating loss for the year that loss is reflected as a reduction in the revenues and net receivables that the Company collects from the school. A school net operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean the Company anticipates losing money on the entire contract with the school. However, a school's net operating loss may reduce the Company's ability to collect its management fees in full and recognized revenues are constrained to reflect the expected cash collections from such schools. The Company records the school's estimated net operating loss against revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year. Actual school net operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions, and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on results of operations. For the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's revenues included a reduction for net school operating losses at the schools of $63.4 million, $45.4 million, and $54.7 million, respectively. Because the Company has agreed to absorb any operating losses of the schools, the Company records the expenses incurred by the school as both revenue and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Amounts recorded as revenues and expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $412.1 million, $325.5 million and $342.7 million, respectively.

## Subscription-based Contracts

The Company provides certain online curriculum and services to schools and school districts under subscription agreements. Revenues from the licensing of curriculum under subscription arrangements are recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Revenues from professional consulting, training and support services are deferred and

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

## recognized ratably over the service period.

In addition, the Company contracts with individual customers who have access for one to two years to company-provided online curriculum and generally prepay for services to be received. Adult learners enroll in courses that provide specialized training in a specific industry. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues pro rata over the maximum term of the customer contract based on the defined contract price.

## Enterprise Contracts

The Company provides job training over a specified contract period to enterprises. Each of these contracts are considered to be one performance obligation. The Company recognizes these revenues based on the number of students trained during the term of the contract based on the defined contract price.

## Disaggregated Revenues

The revenue recognition related to the types of contracts discussed above can span both of the Company's lines of revenue as shown below. For example, a funding-based contract may include both General Education and Career Learning students. In total, there is one performance obligation and revenue is recognized over the Company's fiscal year. The revenue is then disaggregated between General Education and Career Learning based on the Company's estimated full-year enrollment totals of each category. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 88%, 88%, and 87%, respectively, of the Company's General Education revenues, and 98%, 99% and 100%, respectively, of the Company's Middle - High School Career Learning revenues, were from funding-based contracts.

The following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated based on itstwo lines of business for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

## Concentration of Customers

During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company hadzero, zero and one contract, respectively, that represented greater than 10% of revenues.

In fiscal year 2018, the Company and the Agora Cyber Charter School entered into an agreement related to its outstanding receivable of $28.7 million at June 30, 2018 to be paid over afour-year period. In addition, the term of the service agreement was extended through June 30, 2022. The Company reclassified the long-term portion of $23.2 million to deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018. The balance as of June 30, 2021 was $4.2 million and is included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accrues interest on its long-term receivables based on contracted terms.

## Contract Balances

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing, and cash collection results in accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (a contract asset) and deferred revenue (a contract liability) in the consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable are recorded when there is an executed customer contract and the customer is billed. An allowance is recorded to reflect expected losses at the time the receivable is recorded. The collectability of outstanding receivables is evaluated regularly by the Company to determine if additional allowances are needed. Unbilled receivables are created when revenue is earned prior to the customer being billed. Deferred revenue is recorded when customers are billed or cash is collected in advance of services being provided.

The opening and closing balance of the Company's accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue are as follows:

Table of Contents

|                                                                       | June 30,       | June 30,       |

| Accounts receivable                                                   | 369,303        | $ 236,134      |
| Unbilled receivables (included in accounts receivable)                | 24,794         | 15,688         |
| Deferred revenue                                                      | 38,110         | 24,417         |
| Deferred revenue, long-term (included in other long-term liabilities) | 1,973          | 2,236          |

The difference between the opening and closing balance of the accounts receivable and unbilled receivables relates to the timing of the Company's billing in relation to month end and contractual agreements. The difference between the opening and closing balance of the deferred revenue relates to the timing difference between billings to customers and the service periods under the contract. Typically, each of these balances are at their highest during the first quarter of the fiscal year and lowest at the end of the fiscal year. The amount of revenue recognized during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, that was included in the previous July 1 st deferred revenue balance was $25.5 million, $21.5 million, and $23.7 million, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded revenues of ($1.4) million, $5.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods.

## Performance Obligations

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For the majority of its contracts, the Company's performance obligations are satisfied over time, as the Company delivers, and the customer receives the services, over the service period of the contract. The Company's payment terms are generally net 30 or net 45, but can vary depending on the customer or when the school receives its funding from the state.

The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, not to report the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers that have an expected duration of one year or less. The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with customers which extend beyond one year as of June 30, 2021 was $2.0 million.

## Significant Judgments

The Company determined that the majority of its contracts with customers contain one performance obligation. The Company markets the products and services as an integrated package building off its curriculum offerings. It does not market distinct products or services to be sold independently from the curriculum offering. The Company provides the significant service of integrating the goods and services into the operation of the school and education of its students, for which the customer has contracted.

The Company has determined that the time elapsed method is the most appropriate measure of progress towards the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Generally, the Company delivers the integrated products and services

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

package over the course of the Company's fiscal year. This package includes enrollment, marketing, teacher training, etc. in addition to the core curriculum and instruction. All of these activities are necessary and contribute to the overall education of its students, which occurs evenly throughout the year. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis.

The Company determined that the expected value method is the most appropriate method to account for variable consideration and the Company's forecasting method is an estimation process that uses probability to determine expected funding. On a monthly basis, the Company estimates the total funds each school will receive in a particular school year and the amount of full-year school revenues and operating expenses to determine the amount of revenue the Company will recognize. Enrollment and state funding rates are key inputs to this estimate. The estimates are adjusted monthly, and a cumulative catch-up adjustment is recorded to revenue as necessary to reflect the total revenues earned to date to be proportional to the total revenues to be earned in the fiscal year. The Company builds in known constraints (i.e. enrollment, funding, net operating losses, etc.) into the estimate of the variable consideration to record the most probable amount.

## Sales Taxes

Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenues. Collected but unremitted sales tax is included as part of accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Revenues do not include sales tax as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales tax.

## Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are expensed when incurred and are classified as instructional costs and services in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling charges invoiced to a customer are included in revenues.

## Research and Development Costs

All research and development costs, including patent application costs, are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $3.7 million, $9.7 million and $9.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash on hand and cash held in money market and demand deposit accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company periodically has cash balances which exceed federally insured limits.

Restricted cash consists of amounts held in escrow related to the Company's settlement agreement with Agora Cyber Charter School. The restricted cash which is short-term in nature is included in other current assets, while the portion that is long-term is included in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

## Investments in Marketable Securities

The Company's marketable securities generally consist of bonds and other securities which are classified as held-to-maturity. The securities with maturities between three months and one year are classified as short-term and are included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost. Interest income and dividends are recorded within the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company reviews the held-to-maturity debt securities for declines in fair value below the amortized cost basis under the credit loss model of ASC 326. Any declines in fair value related to a credit loss is recognized in the

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

consolidated statements of operations, with the amount of the loss limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. As of June 30, 2021, the allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity debt securities was zero.

As of June 30, 2021, the Company's marketable securities consisted of investments in corporate bonds and U.S. treasury notes. The short-term and long-term portions were $17.3 million and $23.2 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the amortized cost, net carrying amount, and fair value disaggregated by class of instrument.

Table of Contents

|                     | Amortized Cost   | Allowance for Credit Losses   | Net Carrying Amount   | Gross Unrealized Gains (Losses)   | Fair Value   |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Corporate Bonds     | $ 31,850         | $ -                           | $ 31,850              | (24)                              | $ 31,826     |

| Total               | $ 40,542         | $ -                           | $ 40,542              | (24)                              | $ 40,518     |

## Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts primarily for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of individual customers to make required payments. The Company analyzes accounts receivable, historical percentages of uncollectible accounts, and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company maintains an allowance under ASC 326 based on historical losses, customer-specific information, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The allowance under ASC 326 is updated as additional losses are incurred or information becomes available related to the customer or economic conditions.

The Company writes-off accounts receivable based on the age of the receivable and the facts and circumstances surrounding the customer and reasons for non-payment. Actual write-offs might differ from the recorded allowance.

## Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of textbooks and curriculum materials, a majority of which are supplied to virtual and blended public schools, and utilized directly by students. Inventories represent items that are purchased and held for sale and are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company classifies its inventory as current or long-term based on the holding period. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, $8.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of inventory, net of reserves, was deemed long-term and included in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The provision for excess and obsolete inventory is established based upon the evaluation of the quantity on hand relative to demand. The excess and obsolete inventory reserve was $5.6 million and $4.8 million at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

## Other Current Assets

Other current assets consist primarily of textbooks, curriculum materials and other supplies which are expected to be returned upon the completion of the school year. Materials not returned are expensed as part of instructional costs and services. Additionally, other current assets include short-term marketable securities.

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset (or the lesser of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the asset under the finance lease). Amortization of assets capitalized under finance lease arrangements is included in depreciation expense. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. The determination of the lease term is discussed below under "Leases."

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Property and equipment are depreciated over the following useful lives:

|                                     | Useful Life                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Student and state testing computers | 3 - 5 years                                 |

| Furniture and fixtures              | 7 years                                     |
| Leasehold improvements              | Shorter of useful life or term of the lease |

The Company makes an estimate of unreturned student computers based on an analysis of recent trends of returns. The Company recorded accelerated depreciation of $3.2 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to unreturned student computers.

The Company fully expenses computer peripheral equipment (e.g. keyboards, mouses) upon purchase as recovery has been determined to be uneconomical. These expenses totaled $8.4 million, $3.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are recorded as instructional costs and services.

## Capitalized Software Costs

The Company develops software for internal use. Software development costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. The Company amortizes these costs over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three years. Capitalized software development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.

Capitalized software additions totaled $31.3 million, $24.0 million and $26.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no material write-downs of capitalized software projects for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

## Capitalized Curriculum Development Costs

The Company internally develops curriculum, which is primarily provided as online content and accessed via the Internet. The Company also creates textbooks and other materials that are complementary to online content.

The Company capitalizes curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage, as well as the design and deployment phases of the project. As a result, a significant portion of the Company's courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of its development efforts on the content of the courseware. Capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to its customers, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. The period of time over which these development costs are amortized is generally five years.

Total capitalized curriculum development additions were $17.4 million, $19.3 million and $16.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of amortization charges. There were no material write-downs of capitalized curriculum development costs for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

## Leases

The Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases ("ASC 842) as of July 1, 2019. The Company's principal leasing activities include student computers and peripherals, classified as finance leases, and facilities, classified as operating leases.

## Table of Contents

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Leases are classified as operating leases unless they meet any of the criteria below to be classified as a finance lease:

- ● the lease transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease;
- ● the lease grants an option to purchase the asset which the lessee is expected to exercise;
- ● the lease term reflects a major part of the asset's economic life;
- ● the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds the fair value of the asset; or
- ● the asset is specialized with no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the term.

## Finance Leases

The Company enters into agreements to finance the purchase of student computers and peripherals provided to students of its schools. Individual leases typically include 1 to 3-year payment terms, at varying rates, with a $1 purchase option at the end of each lease term. The Company pledges the assets financed to secure the outstanding leases.

## Operating Leases

The Company enters into agreements for facilities that serve as offices for its headquarters, sales and enrollment teams, and school operations. Initial lease terms vary between 1 and 17 years. Certain leases include renewal options, usually based upon current market rates, as well as termination rights. The Company performs an evaluation of each lease to determine if the lease payments included in the renewal option should be included in the initial measurement of the lease liability.

## Discount Rate

The present value of the lease payments is calculated using either the rate implicit in the lease, or the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, over the lease term. For the Company's finance leases, the stated rate is defined within the lease terms; while for the Company's operating leases, the rate is not implicit. For operating leases, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate; determined as the Company's borrowing rate on a collateralized basis for a similar term and amount to the term and amount of the lease.

For its adoption of ASC 842 the Company utilized its agreements used for its finance leases as the basis for calculating its incremental borrowing rate. The rate was collateralized and its term reflected a similar term of the remaining lease payments of the Company's largest operating lease. As of the adoption date, the incremental borrowing rate was 3.86%. Upon the execution of its senior secured revolving credit facility in January 2020 (see Note 8, "Credit Facility"), the Company reassessed its incremental borrowing rate as 2.55%. The incremental borrowing rate is subsequently reassessed upon modification of its leasing arrangements or with the execution of a new lease agreement.

## Policy Elections

## Short-term Leases

The Company has elected as an on-going accounting policy election not to apply ASC 842 to short-term facility leases of 12 months or less. By making this election, the Company will not record a right-of-use asset or lease liability at the commencement of the lease, and will continue to expense its lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The accounting policy election is made by class of underlying asset to which the right of use relates. The Company has elected to apply the accounting policy election only to operating leases.

## Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations subject to amortization are recorded at their fair value. Finite-lived intangible assets include trade names, acquired customers and distributors, developed technology and

## Table of Contents

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

non-compete agreements. Such intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $11.6 million, $6.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and is included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Future amortization of intangible assets is expected to be $12.9 million, $12.7 million, $11.7 million, $10.5 million and $9.4 million in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 through June 30, 2026, respectively and $42.2 million thereafter.

The Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset.

The Company has one reporting unit. The process for testing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment is performed annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred. Companies are also allowed to qualitatively assess goodwill impairment through a screening process which would permit companies to forgo the quantitative impairment test as part of their annual goodwill impairment process. The Company performs its annual assessment on May 31st, which is then updated for any changes in conditions as of June 30 $^{th}$.

During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company qualitatively assessed its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. It identified Coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") as a triggering event, however there were no indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, and as a result, the Company determined that no impairment was required.

On January 27, 2020, the Company acquired Galvanize for $165.0 million and working capital. On November 30, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of MedCerts in exchange for $70.0 million and estimated contingent consideration of $10.8 million; and 100% of Tech Elevator in exchange for $23.5 million, plus working capital of $2.2 million. The Company's acquisitions are discussed in more detail in Note 13, "Acquisitions and Investments."

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets include property, equipment, right-of-use assets, capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use. Management reviews the Company's recorded long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company determines the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon its expectation of the asset's future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company considered whether there were events or circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. It identified COVID-19 as a triggering event, however based on its assessment, the Company determined that COVID-19 did not impact the recoverability of its long-lived assets.

## Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. The net deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company estimates the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Certain restricted stock awards with a market-based performance component are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model that considers a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the Company's common stock price, risk-free rate, and expected stock price

volatility over the expected life of awards. The Company recognizes forfeitures of share-based awards as they occur in the period of forfeiture.

## Advertising and Marketing Costs

Advertising and marketing costs consist primarily of internet advertising, online marketing, direct mail, print media and television commercials and are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs totaled $23.0 million, $32.7 million and $38.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

## Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Measurements are described in a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:

- Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
- Level 3: Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument's valuation.

The carrying values reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and short term debt approximate their fair values, as they are largely short-term in nature. The contingent consideration and Tallo, Inc. convertible note are discussed in more detail in Note 13, "Acquisitions and Investments." As of June 30, 2021, the estimated fair value of the long-term debt was $389.3 million. The Company estimated the fair value based on the quoted market prices in an inactive market on the last day of the reporting period (Level 2). The long-term debt, comprised of the Company's convertible senior notes due 2027, is recorded at face value less the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheet, and is discussed in more detail in Note 7, "Debt." As of June 30, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's marketable securities was $40.5 million. The Company estimated the fair value based on the quoted market prices in an inactive market on the last day of the reporting period (Level 2). The marketable securities are discussed in more detail in Note 3, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies / Investments in Marketable Securities."

## Net Income Per Common Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes vested restricted stock awards. Diluted net income (loss) per share ("EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming conversion or exercise of all dilutive unexercised stock options and vesting of all dilutive unvested restricted stock awards. The dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock awards was determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock awards, the amount of compensation cost for future service not yet recognized by the Company and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded as income tax expense when the stock options become deductible for income tax purposes are all assumed to be used to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock. Stock options and restricted stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share when they are antidilutive. Common stock outstanding reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets includes restricted stock awards outstanding.

The following schedule presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share:

## 5. Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is based on earnings reported in the consolidated financial statements. A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to the expected reversal of the cumulative temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is measured by the change in the deferred income tax asset or liability during the year.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary differences in book versus tax basis accounting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

The Company maintained a valuation allowance on net noncurrent deferred tax assets of $5.0 million and $5.0 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, predominantly related to foreign income tax net operating losses ("NOL").

At June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $65.8 million of available federal NOL carryforwards solely related to the acquisition of Galvanize in January 2020. The federal NOL carryforwards, in the amount of $9.2 million, generated prior to 2018 will begin to expire, if unused, in 2035. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), the federal NOL carryforwards, in the amount of $56.6 million, generated after 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the utilization of NOL carryforwards following a change of control. The Company has performed an analysis of the Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that it will be able to fully utilize its available NOLs subject to the Section 382 limitation.

The increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to the increase in the amount of non-deductible compensation, which was partially offset by the increase in excess tax benefit of stock-based compensation.

## Tax Uncertainties

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740") which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. ASC 740 provides a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. ASC 740 clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. If the probability for sustaining a tax position is greater than 50%, then the tax position is warranted and recognition should be at the highest amount which would be expected to be realized upon ultimate settlement related to unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million in accrued interest and penalties, respectively.

The unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

If recognized, all of the $1.1 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2021 would affect the effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.

The Company remains subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service for federal tax purposes for tax years after June 30, 2017. Certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions are also either currently under audit or remain open under the statute of limitations for the tax years after June 30, 2015.

## Convertible Senior Notes due 2027

In August and September 2020, the Company issued $420.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 ("Notes"). The Notes are governed by an indenture (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $408.6 million after deducting the underwriting fees and other expenses paid by the Company.

The Notes bear interest at a rate of1.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 $^{st}$ and September 1$^{st}$ of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on September 1, 2027. The Company recorded coupon interest expense of $3.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.

The Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The initial carrying amount of the liability component was $294.6 million and was calculated using a discount rate of6.5%. The discount rate was based on the terms of a similar debt instrument as the Notes without the associated conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the Notes, or $125.4 million. The amount recorded in equity is not subject to remeasurement or amortization.

The $125.4 million also represents the initial discount recorded on the Notes. The discount is accreted to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $11.4 million. These costs were allocated pro rata to liabilities and equity based upon the initial carrying values attributable to each. The portion of the debt issuance costs allocated to equity is not subject to amortization; while the portion allocated to liabilities is amortized over the contractual term of the Notes. The Company recorded interest expense related to the accretion of the discount and the amortization of the debt issuance costs of $12.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, during the year ended June 30, 2021. The effective interest rate of the Notes for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 6.4%.

Before June 1, 2027, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. After June 1, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until two days prior to the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying cash up to the outstanding principal amount, and at the Company's election, will settle the conversion spread by paying or delivering cash or shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. The initial conversion rate is 18.9109 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $52.88 per share of common stock. The Notes will be redeemable at the Company's option at any time after September 6, 2024 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain stock price hurdles as discussed in the Indenture.

In connection with the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions") with certain counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to cover the aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock that initially underlie the Notes, and are expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The upper strike price of the Capped Call Transactions is $86.174 per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was $60.4 million and was recorded within additional paid-in capital.

## 8. Credit Facility

On January 27, 2020, the Company entered into a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") to be used for general corporate operating purposes with PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Credit Facility has a five-year term and incorporates customary financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The majority of the Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility are at LIBOR plus an additional rate ranging from 0.875% - 1.50% based on the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Credit Facility is secured by the Company's assets. The Credit Facility agreement allows for an

amendment to establish a new benchmark interest rate when LIBOR is discontinued during thefive-year term. As of June 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. As part of the proceeds received from the Notes, the Company repaid its $100.0 million outstanding balance and as of June 30, 2021, the Company had no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility also includes a $200.0 million accordion feature.

## 9. Equity Incentive Plan

On December 15, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), the Company's stockholders approved the 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is designed to attract, retain and motivate employees who make important contributions to the Company by providing such individuals with equity ownership opportunities. Awards granted under the Plan may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards. Under the Plan, the following types of shares go back into the pool of shares available for issuance:

- ● unissued shares related to forfeited or cancelled restricted stock and stock options from Plan awards and Prior Plan awards (that were outstanding as of the Effective Date), and;
- ● shares tendered to satisfy the tax withholding obligation related to the vesting of restricted stock (but not stock options).

Unlike the Company's 2007 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "Prior Plan"), the Plan has no evergreen provision to increase the shares available for issuance; any new shares would require stockholder approval. The Prior Plan expired in October 2017, and the Company no longer awards equity from the Prior Plan. At June 30, 2021, the remaining aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock authorized for future issuance under the Plan was 575,026. At June 30, 2021, there were 4,378,183 shares of the Company's common stock that remain outstanding or nonvested under the Plan and Prior Plan.

Compensation expense for all equity-based compensation awards is based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. For awards subject to service and performance-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense retroactively through a cumulative catch-up adjustment when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

## Stock Options

Each stock option is exercisable pursuant to the vesting schedule set forth in the stock option agreement granting such stock option, generally over four years. No stock option shall be exercisable after the expiration of its option term. The Company has granted stock options under the Prior Plan and the Company has also granted stock options to executive officers under stand-alone agreements outside the Prior Plan.

The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company's stock. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $24.6 million, $0.0 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.

As of June 30, 2021, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options granted.

## Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards (included above)

During the year ended June 30, 2021, 126,417 new performance-based restricted stock awards were granted and in total, 574,611 remain nonvested at June 30, 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2021,110,594 performance-based restricted stock awards vested. Vesting of the performance-based restricted stock awards is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance goals and service vesting conditions.

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 30,364 performance-based restricted stock awards to the Company's CEO with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $24.70 per share. These awards were granted pursuant to the Plan and are subject to the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA metrics for the calendar year 2021. If achieved, one-third of the award will vest immediately, and the remaining two-thirds will vest annually over two years. The Company is currently amortizing these awards over their vesting periods because it believes that it is probable that the Adjusted EBITDA metric will be achieved at outperform for calendar year 2021.

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 82,710 performance-based restricted stock awards to the Company's named executive officers ("NEOs") with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $45.33 per share. These awards were granted pursuant to the Plan and are subject to the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA metrics in fiscal year 2021. If achieved, onethird of the award will vest immediately, and the remaining two-thirds will vest annually over the following two years. The Company is currently amortizing these awards over their vesting periods because it believes that it is probable that the Adjusted EBITDA metric will be achieved at outperform for fiscal year 2021.

During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted 358,294 performance-based restricted stock awards to the Company's then CEO with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $27.91 per share. These awards were granted pursuant to the Plan and are subject to the achievement of target free cash flow metrics in each of the fiscal years 2020 through 2022. The metrics are measured at the end of each fiscal year; however, the first two-thirds of the award will not vest until fiscal year 2021. The remainingone-third will vest in fiscal year 2022, if achieved. Additionally, if either of the first two tranches are not achieved, the awards may still vest if the free cash flow metric in aggregate is met over the three-year life of the award. The Company is currently amortizing the second and third tranches over their vesting periods because it believes that it is probable that the free cash flow targets will be met each year. The free cash flow metric was not met for fiscal year 2020; however, the Company believes that it will be met in aggregate, and therefore is amortizing the first tranche over a three-year period.

During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted 141,524 performance-based restricted stock awards to the

Company's NEOs with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $27.91 per share. These awards were granted pursuant to the Plan and are subject to the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA metrics in fiscal year 2020. In August 2020, achievement was certified at 109% of target, which resulted in an additional 13,343 shares, and one-third of the award vested; the remaining two-thirds will vest annually over two years.

## Service-Based Restricted Stock Awards (included above)

During the year ended June 30, 2021 451,653 new service-based restricted stock awards were granted and in total,834,724 remain nonvested at June 30, 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2021, 594,327 service-based restricted stock awards vested.

## Summary of All Restricted Stock Awards

As of June 30, 2021, there was $24.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. The fair value of restricted stock awards granted for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $21.9 million and $30.2 million, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $24.5 million and $17.9 million, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $22.6 million, $17.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards.

## Performance Share Units ("PSU")

The Company has approved grants of performance share units ("PSU") pursuant to the Plan. Each PSU is earned through the achievement of a performance-based metric, combined with the continuation of employee service over a defined period. The level of performance determines the number of PSUs earned, and is generally measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels of the award. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, or at the option of the Company, an equivalent amount of cash, and is classified as an equity or liability award. When the grant is a fixed monetary amount, and the number of shares is not determined until achievement and the value of the Company's stock on that day, the PSU is a liability-classified award. Each PSU vests pursuant to the vesting schedule found in the respective PSU agreement.

In addition to the performance conditions of the PSUs, there is a service vesting condition which is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company, unless the grantee is eligible for earlier vesting upon a change in control and qualifying termination, as defined by the PSU agreement. PSUs are generally subject to graduated vesting schedules and stock-based compensation expense is computed by tranche and recognized on a straight-line basis over the tranches' applicable vesting period based on the expected achievement level.

## Fiscal Year 2021 Tech Elevator MIP

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted, to the executive team of Tech Elevator, a time-based award with a value of $4.0 million and a performance-based award with a target value of $4.0 million under a Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"). The time-based award vests equally over three years on the anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition of Tech Elevator (see Note 13, "Acquisitions and Investments" for additional detail on the Company's acquisition). The performance-based award is tied to the achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets of Tech Elevator. Seventy percent of the award is based on Tech Elevator's revenues for the calendar year 2023 ("Tranche #1") and thirty percent of the earned award is based on Tech Elevator's EBITDA for the calendar year 2023 ("Tranche #2"), both of which are expected to vest after achievement is certified in January 2024. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold and target achievement levels. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The MIP is a liability-classified award. The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance conditions are not able to be determined at this time.

## Fiscal Year 2021 LTIP

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 111,450 PSUs at target under a Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") which are tied to the achievement of certain individualized financial and non-financial performance targets. These PSUs had a grant date fair value of $2.7 million, or a weighted average grant-date fair value of $24.15 per share. Forty percent will vest after achievement is certified during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and sixty percent will vest one year later. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The fiscal year 2021 LTIP is an equityclassified award. The Company is currently amortizing certain awards over their vesting periods because it believes that it is probable that the specific metrics will be achieved. One metric with a target grant date fair value of $0.3 million is assumed to be achieved at target, two metrics with a target grant date fair value of $0.2 million is assumed to be achieved at threshold, and the remaining metrics are currently being assessed as not probable of achievement.

## Fiscal Year 2021 Career Learning PSUs

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 366,250 PSUs at target which are tied to the achievement of Career Learning revenues targets for fiscal years 2021 - 2023. These PSUs had a grant date fair value of $16.5 million, or a weighted average grant-date fair value of $45.05 per share. The vesting is as follows:

- ● 77,690 PSUs relate to fiscal year 2021 revenues and if achieved,one-third of the award will vest immediately, and the remaining two-thirds will vest annually over two years;
- ● 122,080 PSUs relate to fiscal year 2022 revenues and if achieved,two-thirds of the award will vest immediately, and the remaining one-third will vest the following year; and
- ● 166,480 PSUs relate to fiscal year 2023 revenues and if achieved, the award will vest immediately.

The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The fiscal year 2021 Career Learning PSUs are an equity-classified award. The Company determined the achievement of the performance conditions associated with the fiscal year 2021 revenues and fiscal year 2022 revenues was not probable, and probable at the target level, respectively. The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance conditions associated with the fiscal year 2023 revenues are not able to be determined at this time.

## Fiscal Year 2020 Galvanize TRIP

During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted, to the executive team of Galvanize, a target level of $12.3 million under a Transaction Related Incentive Plan ("TRIP") which is tied to the achievement of certain revenue and EBITDA targets of Galvanize. Seventy percent of the earned award is based on the performance of Galvanize for the calendar year 2021 ("Tranche #1") andthirty percent of the earned award is based on the performance of Galvanize for the calendar year 2022 ("Tranche #2"), both of which are expected to vest after achievement is certified in January following each of the calendar year ends. The revenue and EBITDA targets are split sixty percent and forty percent, respectively, for both tranches. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. The TRIP is a liability-classified award. The Company determined the likelihood of achievement of the performance conditions associated with all tranches are not probable.

## Fiscal Year 2019 LTIP

During fiscal year 2019, the Company granted 263,936 PSUs at target under a LTIP which are tied to certain career learning revenue targets and enrollment levels, as well as students' academic progress. These PSUs had a grant date fair value of $ 7.9 million, or a weighted average grant-date fair value of $30.05 per share. During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted an additional34,030 PSUs at target with a grant date fair value of $0.8 million, or $23.51 per share. Forty-five percent of the earned award is based on students' academic progress ("Tranche #1") and twenty-five percent of the earned award is based on certain enrollment levels ("Tranche #2"), both of which will vest after achievement is certified on October 15, 2021. The remaining thirty percent of the earned award is based on certain revenue targets ("Tranche #3") and will vest after achievement is certified on August 15, 2022. The level of performance will determine the number of PSUs earned as measured against threshold, target and outperform achievement levels. In all cases, vesting is dependent upon continuing service by the grantee as an employee of the Company. The Company determined the achievement of the performance conditions associated with Tranche #1 was not probable, while Tranche #2 and Tranche #3 was determined to be probable at the outperform level for both.

## Fiscal Year 2019 SPP

During fiscal year 2019, the Company adopted a new long-term shareholder performance plan ("2019 SPP") that provides for incentive award opportunities to its key senior executives. The awards were granted in the form of PSUs and will be earned based on the Company's market capitalization growth over a completed three-year performance period. The 2019 SPP was designed to provide the executives with a percentage of shareholder value growth. No amounts will be

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

earned if total stock price growth over thethree-year period is below 25% (7.6% annualized). An amount of 6% of total value growth will be earned based on achieving total stock price growth of 33% (10% annualized) and a maximum of 7.5% of total value growth will be earned if total stock price growth equals or exceeds 95% (25% annualized).

During fiscal year 2019, the Company granted 2,108,305 PSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $8.18 per share, based on the highest level of performance. During fiscal year 2020, the Company granted an additional 66,934 PSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $12.56 per share, based on the highest level of performance. The final amount of PSUs will be determined (and vesting will occur) based on the 30-day average price of the Company's stock subsequent toseven days after the release of fiscal year 2021 results. The fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The SPP is a market-based award, and therefore is not subject to any probability assessment by the Company.

## Summary of All Performance Share Units

As of June 30, 2021, there was $11.6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested PSUs that are expected to vest based on the Company's probability assumptions discussed above. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.5 years. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company recognized $16.7 million, $6.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to PSUs. Included in the stock-based compensation expense above is $0.8 million related to the Tech Elevator time-based portion of the MIP. This amount was recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets because it is a liability-classified award.

## Deferred Stock Units ("DSU")

The DSUs vest on the grant-date anniversary and are settled in the form of shares of common stock issued to the holder upon separation from the Company. DSUs are specific only to board members.

Deferred stock unit activity during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:

## 10. Commitments and Contingencies

## Litigation

In the ordinary conduct of the Company's business, the Company is subject to lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative proceedings from time to time. The Company vigorously defends these claims; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. The Company believes, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any existing or known threatened proceedings, even if determined adversely, should not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

## Georgia Cyber Academy Arbitration

On May 10, 2019, K12 Virtual Schools LLC filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), Case No. 01-19-001-4778, naming Georgia Cyber Academy, Inc. ("GCA") as the respondent. The demand asserted claims for GCA's breach and anticipatory breach of the Educational Products and Services Agreement between GCA and K12 Virtual Schools LLC, as amended on January 4, 2019, based on GCA's engagement of other educational products and service providers for the school year 2019-2020.

## Securities Litigation

On November 19 and December 11, 2020, respectively, two putative securities class action lawsuits captioned Yun Chau Lee v. K12 Inc., et al, Case No. 1:20-cv-01419 (the "Lee Case"), and Jennifer Baig v. K12 Inc., et al, Case No. 1:20-cv-01528 (the "Baig Case") were filed against the Company, one of its current officers, and one of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, purportedly on behalf of a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock between April 27, 2020 and September 18, 2020, inclusive. On February 17, 2021, the Court consolidated the Lee Case and the Baig Case under the caption In re K12 Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. 1:20-cv-01419 (the "Consolidated Securities Class Action"), and appointed a lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on April 5, 2021, alleging violations by the Company and the individual defendants of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b5 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and violations by the individual defendants of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and the individual defendants made false or misleading statements and/or omitted to disclose material facts concerning its technological capabilities and expertise to support increased demand for virtual and blended education related to the global emergence of COVID-19, its cybersecurity protocols and protections, and its administrative support and training to teachers, students, and parents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on May 20, 2021, and a decision on the motion remains outstanding.

Derivative Litigation, Case No. 20-01731 (the "Consolidated Derivative Action"), and designated as operative the complaint filed in the Ahmed Case. The operative complaint purports to assert claims on the Company's behalf against certain of its officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and for violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, corporate governance reforms, and other relief. The Consolidated Derivative Action is stayed pending resolution of the Company's motion to dismiss in the Consolidated Securities Class Action.

We intend to defend vigorously against each and every allegation and asserted claim in these matters.

## Employment Agreements

The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers that provide for severance payments and, in some cases other benefits, upon certain terminations of employment. Except for the agreement with the Company's Executive Chairman with an amended extended term to September 30, 2022, all other agreements provide for employment on an "at-will" basis. If the employee resigns for "good reason" or is terminated without cause, the employee is entitled to salary continuation, and in some cases benefit continuation, for varying periods depending on the agreement.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of June 30, 2021, the Company provided guarantees of approximately $0.5 million related to lease commitments on the buildings for certain of the Company's schools.

In addition, the Company contractually guarantees that certain schools under the Company's management will not have annual operating deficits and the Company's management fees from these schools may be reduced accordingly to cover any school operating deficits.

Other than these lease and operating deficit guarantees, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

## Risks and Uncertainties

## Impacts of COVID-19 on Stride's Business

While the long-term impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 is not estimable or determinable, beginning in late fiscal year 2020, the Company experienced an increase in demand for its products and services.

The Company continues to conduct business as usual with some modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain events. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that it determines is in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on the Company's business, including the effects on its

customers and prospects, or on its long-term financial results.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was enacted and signed into law. The Company has evaluated the business provisions in the CARES Act and adopted the deferral of the employer portion of the social security payroll tax (6.2%) outlined within. The deferral is effective from the enactment date through December 31, 2020. The deferred amount of $14.1 million will be paid intwo installments, 50% of the deferred amount by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. The deferred payroll taxes due on December 31, 2021 are recorded within accrued liabilities and the deferred payroll taxes due on December 31, 2022 are recorded within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

## 11. Restructuring

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company exited three facilities that were no longer being utilized, which were subject to operating leases. In aggregate, during fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded an impairment of $5.4 million for the three leases. As part of the adoption of ASC 842, the lease impairment liability of $ 1.8 million as of June 30, 2019 was offset against the right-of-use asset.

## 12. Severance

During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company reduced its workforce, resulting in severance of $2.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Included in severance expense for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, associated with accelerated vesting of equity awards to former executives and other employees.

## 13. Acquisitions and Investments

## Acquisition of MedCerts, LLC

On November 30, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of MedCerts in exchange for $70.0 million and estimated contingent consideration of $10.8 million. The purchase price is payable intwo tranches; $55.0 million was paid at closing, and $15.0 million plus the final contingent consideration will be paid on the 18-month anniversary of the closing. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company paid an additional $0.3 million related to the finalization of the working capital. MedCerts students participate in online, hands-on career training courses in the healthcare and medical fields as they prepare for more than a dozen national healthcare certifications. The acquisition of MedCerts further expands the Company's post-secondary skills training in the healthcare and medical fields. The Company also plans to use MedCerts' curriculum to create appropriate content to offer high school students.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which results in acquired assets and assumed liabilities being measured at their estimated fair values as of November 30, 2020, the acquisition date. As of the acquisition date, goodwill was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

## STRIDE, INC.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Based on management's preliminary valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which was based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to change, the preliminary estimated purchase price was allocated as follows (in thousands):

## Allocation of Purchase Price

Table of Contents

| Cash                           | 205     |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| Current assets, excluding cash | 5,074   |
| Property and equipment, net    | 1,896   |
| Intangible assets, net         | 26,607  |
| Goodwill                       | 51,033  |

| Deferred revenue               | (1,562) |
| Deferred tax asset (liability) | 16      |
| Total consideration            | 81,068  |

The final purchase price allocation will be completed within one year of the acquisition date ("measurement period"). If information becomes available which would indicate material adjustments are required to the purchase price allocation, such adjustments will be included in the purchase price allocation retrospectively.

The fair value of the identified intangible assets was determined primarily using an income-based approach of either the multi-period excess earnings method or relief from royalty method, as appropriate. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the amortization periods noted below.

## Intangible Assets

| Intangible Assets      | Amount (In thousands)   | Estimated Useful Life (In years)   |

| Customer relationships | 12,072                  | 5.84                               |
| Developed technology   | 11,970                  | 7.00                               |
| Trade names            | 2,565                   | 5.00                               |

The contingent consideration represents the fair value of additional consideration payable to the seller, estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The amount of consideration to be distributed on the 18-month anniversary of the closing is based on a multiplier calculated using the annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the period December 2021 - May 2022. This multiplier is applied to the annualized trailing EBITDA for the period March 2022 - May 2022 to calculate an enterprise value of MedCerts as of May 2022. The payment, if any, will equal 49% of the enterprise value less49% of the original purchase price of $70.0 million ($34.3 million).

Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company is required to reassess its estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration, and record any changes in earnings when the estimate is based on information not known as of the acquisition date. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded an expense of $0.3 million related to the estimate of the fair value of its contingent consideration. That adjustment is recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of June 30, 2021 was $11.1 million and is recorded within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for

impairment at least annually (or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise). In the event that management determines that the goodwill has become impaired, the Company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

Included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 are revenues and a loss from operations of $14.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to MedCerts.

## Acquisition of Tech Elevator, Inc.

On November 30, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of Tech Elevator in exchange for $23.5 million, plus working capital of $2.2 million. Like Galvanize, Tech Elevator provides talent development for individuals and enterprises in information technology fields. The acquisition of Tech Elevator expands Galvanize's student demographic profile, geographic footprint, and hiring partner portfolio; as well as provides additional curriculum to create appropriate content to offer high school students.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which results in acquired assets and assumed liabilities being measured at their estimated fair values as of November 30, 2020, the acquisition date. As of the acquisition date, goodwill was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Based on management's preliminary valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which was based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to change, the preliminary estimated purchase price was allocated as follows (in thousands):

| Long-term operating lease liability      | (304)   |
| Total consideration                      | 25,695  |

The final purchase price allocation will be completed within one year of the acquisition date ("measurement period"). If information becomes available which would indicate material adjustments are required to the purchase price allocation, such adjustments will be included in the purchase price allocation retrospectively.

The fair value of the identified intangible assets was determined primarily using an income-based approach of either the multiperiod excess earnings method or relief from royalty method, as appropriate. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the amortization periods noted below.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise). In the event that management determines that the goodwill has become impaired, the Company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 are revenues and income from operations of $7.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, related to Tech Elevator.

## Acquisition of Galvanize, Inc.

On January 27, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of Galvanize in exchange for $165.0 million, plus working capital of $9.2 million. Galvanize provides talent development for individuals and enterprises in information technology fields. The acquisition of Galvanize expands the Company's offerings to include post-secondary skills training in data science and software engineering, technology staffing and developing talent and capabilities for companies. The Company also plans to use Galvanize's curriculum to create appropriate content to offer high school students.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which results in acquired assets and assumed liabilities being measured at their fair values as of January 27, 2020, the acquisition date. As of the acquisition date, goodwill was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The Company made several adjustments to its fiscal year 2020 allocation of the preliminary purchase price during fiscal year 2021.

- ● The value of the operating lease right-of-use assets, net increased from $99.7 million to $100.2 million. Lease expense in fiscal year 2021 was not significantly impacted by the updated balance as of the acquisition date.
- ● The Company and the sellers finalized its working capital calculation resulting in an adjustment to the purchase price of $3.0 million.
- ● Goodwill decreased from $84.7 million to $81.2 million as a result of the adjustments above.

## Investment in Tallo, Inc.

In August 2018, the Company made an initial investment of $6.7 million for a 39.5% minority interest in Tallo, Inc. ("Tallo"). In August 2020, the Company invested an additional $2.3 million which increased its minority interest to 46.1%. These investments in preferred stock, which contain additional rights over common stock and have no readily determinable fair value, were recorded at cost and will be adjusted, as necessary, for impairment.

Tallo also issued a convertible note to the Company for $5.0 million that will be accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security and adjusted to fair value quarterly. The note bears interest at the mid-term Applicable Federal Rate plus 25 bps per annum with a maturity of48 months. The note is convertible at the Company's option into 3.67 million Series D Preferred Shares that would give the Company an effective ownership of 53% if exercised. The Company's investment in Tallo is included in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Internal control over financial reporting refers to a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

- ● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
- ● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and members of our board of directors; and
- ● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

We acquired MedCerts and Tech Elevator on November 30, 2020, each which represented less than 1% of our revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Excluding goodwill, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets recorded from the transaction, MedCerts and Tech Elevator each represented less than 1% of our total assets as of June 30, 2021. As the MedCerts and Tech Elevator acquisitions were completed during the second quarter of fiscal year

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

2021, the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting does not include the MedCerts and Tech Elevator businesses. This exclusion is pursuant to the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business' internal control over financial reporting may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment of its internal control over financial reporting for one year following the date of acquisition.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 using the framework set forth in the report of the Treadway Commission's Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO), "Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013)." As a result of management's evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 has been audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the subsequent page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:

We completed the implementation of our new NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The implementation of that ERP system is expected to, among other things, improve user access security and automate a number of accounting, back office and reporting processes and activities, thereby decreasing the amount of manual processes previously required. Except for the implementation of the new ERP system, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2021 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As it relates specifically to the last fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are not required to include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of an entity acquired during the reporting period in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for Stride. We are in the process of incorporating MedCerts' and Tech Elevator's operations into our internal control over financial reporting and intend to complete this within one year of the acquisition date.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders Stride, Inc.

Herndon, Virginia

## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Stride, Inc.'s (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO criteria"). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria .

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Item 9A, Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting". Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As indicated in the accompanying "Item 9A, Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting", management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of MedCerts and Tech Elevator, which were acquired on November 30, 2020, and which are included in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. As of June 30, 2021, MedCerts and Tech Elevator each constituted less than 1% of total assets and net assets, excluding the goodwill, intangible assets and operating right-ofuse assets and related lease liabilities recorded for MedCerts and Tech Elevator. For the year ended June 30, 2021, MedCerts recorded a net loss of $3.5 million and Tech Elevator recorded net income of $0.4 million and each constituted less than 1% of consolidated revenues. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of MedCerts and Tech Elevator because of the timing of the acquisitions which were completed on November 30, 2020. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of MedCerts and Tech Elevator.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting

## Table of Contents

principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
