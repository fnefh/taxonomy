## SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "will," "may, "could," "should," "would," "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "targets," "seeks" and "believes," as well as variations of these words, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to Vimeo's future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forwardlooking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:

- · we have a history of losses,
- · our prior rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance, and our revenue has declined in recent periods,
- · our limited operating history as a pure software-as-a-service ("SaaS") company and our limited history of selling such plans through our sales force,
- · our total addressable market may prove to be smaller than we expect,
- · our ability to read data and make forecasts may be limited,
- · we may not have the right product/market fit and may not be able to attract free users or subscribers,
- · we may not be able to convert our free users into subscribers,
- · competition in our market is intense,
- · we may not be able to scale our business effectively,
- · we may need additional funding as we continue to grow our business,
- · the use or capabilities of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability,
- · we may experience service interruptions,
- · hosting and delivery costs may increase unexpectedly,
- · weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations,
- · our business involves hosting large quantities of user content,
- · we have been sued for hosting content that allegedly infringed on a third-party copyright,
- · we may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials,
- · we have faced negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law,
- · we collect, store and process large amounts of content and personal information and any loss of or unauthorized access to such data could materially impact our business,
- · if our business becomes constrained by changing legal and regulatory requirements, including with respect to privacy, data security and data protection, consumer protection, and user-generated content, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate, our operating results will suffer,
- · we may experience a disruption of our business activities due to senior executive transitions,
- · we have been the target of cyberattacks by malicious actors,
- · we have faced claims that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights, and
- · the risks described in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forwardlooking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to this report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. Any forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking information or statements, whether written or oral, to reflect any change, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

## NOTE 1-ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

## Description of Business

Vimeo is the world's leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service model. Vimeo's comprehensive and cloud-based tools empower its users to create, collaborate and communicate with video on a single, turnkey platform.

As used herein, "Vimeo," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms in these consolidated financial statements refer to Vimeo, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).

## Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

All intercompany balances and transactions between and among Vimeo and its subsidiaries have been eliminated. All related party balances between Vimeo and IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC") and its subsidiaries are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet within "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities."

All related party transactions between Vimeo and IAC and its subsidiaries, other than amounts related to the settlement of equity awards, are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities. Amounts related to the settlement of equity awards are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as financing activities.

## Accounting Estimates

Management of Vimeo is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include those related to: the carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for credit losses; the determination of the estimated customer relationship period for certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer; the carrying value of right-of-use assets ("ROU assets") and related lease liabilities; the useful lives and recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives; the recoverability of goodwill; contingencies; unrecognized tax benefits; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the accounting for stockbased compensation expense, among others. Vimeo bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets and other factors that Vimeo considers relevant.

## NOTE 2-REVENUE

## Revenue Recognition

Vimeo's revenue is derived primarily from fixed SaaS subscription fees paid by customers. Subscription periods generally range from one month to three years, with the most common being an annual subscription, and are generally non-cancellable.

Vimeo accounts for a contract with a customer when it has approval and commitment from all parties, the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The transaction price, which generally reflects the fixed SaaS subscription fees listed in the terms of the contract, is the amount of consideration Vimeo expects to be entitled to in exchange for access to the Vimeo platform. The transaction price is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date access is provided to the Vimeo platform, which is considered to be a series of distinct services that comprise a single performance obligation and have the same pattern of transfer over the contractual term. All taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers are excluded from the measurement of the transaction price, and accordingly, not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, Vimeo does not consider the time value of money applicable to such contracts. Estimates of variable consideration are not significant.

Disaggregated revenue is as follows:

## Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue consists of payments that are received or are contractually due in advance of Vimeo's performance. Vimeo's deferred revenue is reported on a contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Vimeo classifies deferred revenue as current when the term of the applicable subscription period or expected completion of its performance obligation is one year or less. The current and non-current deferred revenue balances are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows:

Table of Contents

|                             | June 30, 2024   | December 31, 2023   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
|                             | (In thousands)  | (In thousands)      |
| Deferred revenue            | 168,014         | 168,610             |
| Other long-term liabilities | 1,107           | 1,216               |

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, Vimeo recognized $126.9 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, Vimeo recognized $126.3 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2022.

## Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

Vimeo has determined that commissions paid to employees pursuant to certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized as a cost of obtaining a contract with a customer. Commissions paid to employees pursuant to certain sales incentive programs are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period. Vimeo calculates the estimated customer relationship period as the average customer life, which is based on historical data. When customer renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission, the average customer life includes renewal periods. Vimeo has elected the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract with a customer as incurred when the customer relationship period is one year or less.

The current and non-current balances of capitalized costs to obtain a contract with a customer are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows:

|                                           | June 30, 2024   | December 31, 2023   |

|                                           | (In thousands)  | (In thousands)      |
| Prepaid expenses and other current assets | 5,066           | 5,099               |
| Other non-current assets                  | 8,108           | 8,263               |

## NOTE 3-INCOME TAXES

At the end of each interim period, Vimeo estimates the annual expected effective income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date earnings or loss with discrete items recorded in the period. The estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained, or Vimeo's tax environment changes.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, Vimeo recorded an income tax provision of $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, Vimeo recorded an income tax provision of $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to movement in the valuation allowance, the effects of international tax provisions as required under 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by stock-based awards. Vimeo's largest deferred tax assets are capitalized research and development expenses and tax attribute carryforwards. Vimeo has recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were $5.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The Company would recognize an income tax benefit of $0.5 million if unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2024 are subsequently recognized. Vimeo believes no unrecognized tax benefits would decrease by June 30, 2025. Vimeo recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if applicable, in the income tax provision.

## NOTE 4-FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Vimeo's financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

## NOTE 7-EARNINGS PER SHARE

Vimeo common stock and Class B common stock are treated as one class of common stock for earnings per share ("EPS") purposes as both classes of common stock participate in earnings, dividends and other distributions on the same basis. Vimeo calculates basic EPS using the two-class method since the Vimeo Restricted Shares are participating securities as they are unvested and have a non-forfeitable dividend right in the event the Company declares a cash dividend to common shareholders and participates in all other distributions of the Company in the same manner as all other Vimeo common shareholders. Diluted EPS is calculated, on the most dilutive basis, which excludes equity awards that would be anti-dilutive.

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders is as follows:

## NOTE 9-CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of business, Vimeo is, and from time to time may become, a party to various legal proceedings. Vimeo establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where it believes an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against Vimeo, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of Vimeo, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. Vimeo also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of Vimeo. See " Note 3-Income Taxes " for additional information related to income tax contingencies.

## EMI/Capitol Records Copyright Infringement Litigation

In December 2009, a group of music publishers owned by EMI Music Publishing (now owned by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment) and a group of then EMI-affiliated record companies, including Capitol Records (now owned by Universal Music Group), filed two lawsuits against Vimeo and its former owner, Connected Ventures, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. See Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC , No. 09 Civ. 10101 (S.D.N.Y.) and EMI Blackwood Music, Inc. v. Vimeo, LLC , No. 09 Civ. 10105 (S.D.N.Y.). In both cases, plaintiffs allege that Vimeo infringed their music copyrights (in the publishers' musical compositions and the record companies' sound recordings) by hosting and streaming videos uploaded by users (and in certain cases, former employees) featuring their musical works. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief and monetary damages. The initial complaints identified 199 videos as infringing (which Vimeo removed post-suit).

Prior to suit, plaintiffs did not avail themselves of their right to submit a takedown notice to Vimeo pursuant to the online safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), which limits the liability of online service providers for copyright infringement of their users when the provider takes certain measures. Vimeo asserts that the DMCA limits its liability because it complies with the DMCA and plaintiffs failed to submit takedown notices. Plaintiffs disagree, asserting various theories as to why the DMCA may not apply to some or all of the videos-in-suit.

The district court bifurcated proceedings and required the parties to first litigate the issue of whether Vimeo satisfied the DMCA's safe harbor provisions. On September 18, 2013, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Vimeo on 144 of the 199 original videos-in-suit on the ground that Vimeo complied with the threshold requirements of the DMCA and that there was no evidence that a Vimeo employee had watched the videos in question such that Vimeo had actual or "red flag" knowledge of infringement, which would disqualify the DMCA's application. The court denied summary judgment as to 35 videos-in-suit on the ground that there was a material question of fact as to whether Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge of infringement based upon employees having watched all or part of these videos. The court further held that the DMCA did not apply to the record companies' state-law claims regarding sound recordings fixed before February 1972; a trial was necessary to determine whether Vimeo was liable for employees who uploaded approximately 20 videos; and that plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their complaints to add over1,500 videos allegedly infringing their copyrights (which Vimeo removed after receiving plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint).

Vimeo sought and obtained the right to appeal certain issues on an interlocutory basis to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On June 16, 2016, the Second Circuit held that (1) the district court had applied the incorrect summary-judgment standard for "red flag" infringement and that evidence that an employee watched all or part of a video containing plaintiffs' music did not raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge in such video; (2) the DMCA applies to state-law copyright infringement claims predicated on pre-1972 sound recordings; and (3) on an issue raised by plaintiffs in their cross-appeal, the record did not show that Vimeo was willfully blind towards infringing activity taking place on its platform. As a result of these rulings, the Second Circuit partially vacated the district court's ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its judgment.

On March 31, 2018, the district court granted Vimeo's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' state-law unfair competition claims on the grounds that they were state-law copyright claims covered by the DMCA per the Second Circuit's judgment. On May 28, 2021, the district court granted Vimeo summary judgment as to videos for which the sole remaining basis of liability was the assertion that Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge of infringement. On August 26, 2021, the district court approved a stipulation whereby plaintiffs agreed to conditionally dismiss all remaining claims to allow a final judgment to issue. Under the stipulation, plaintiffs may refile their claims regarding the alleged employee-uploaded videos if the Second Circuit reverses the district court's other rulings in whole or in part. On November 1, 2021, the district court entered a final judgment adopting the terms of the parties' stipulation. On November 29, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed and argued.

## RTI Copyright Litigation

Between 2012 and 2017, Italian broadcaster Reti Televisive Italiane s.p.a. and an affiliate thereof (collectively, "RTI") filedfour lawsuits for copyright infringement against Vimeo in the Civil Court of Rome. See Reti Televisive Italiane s.p.a. v. Vimeo, LLC , Cause Nos. 23732/12, 62343/2015, and 59780/2017 (Rome Civil Court), and Medusa Film v. Vimeo, Inc. , Cause No. 74775/2017 (Rome Civil Court). In each case, RTI asserts that Vimeo infringed its copyrights by hosting and streaming useruploaded videos that allegedly contain RTI's television or film programming, and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and monetary damages.

On January 15, 2019, the Civil Court of Rome concluded the first case (No. 23732/12) and entered a judgment against Vimeo, awarding RTI damages of € 8,500,000 plus interest and entering an injunction against Vimeo with respect to further acts of infringement. Vimeo filed an appeal and petitioned to stay the judgment pending appeal. On May 13, 2019, the Rome Court of Appeals stayed the judgment pending appeal. On August 10, 2022, the Rome Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. Vimeo has appealed to the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation and the case is currently pending (No. 26719/2022).

On June 2, 2019, the Civil Court of Rome concluded the second case (No. 62343/2015) and entered a judgment against Vimeo, awarding RTI damages of€4,746, 273 plus interest and entering an injunction against Vimeo as to further acts infringement. Vimeo filed an appeal and petitioned to stay the judgment pending appeal. The Rome Court of Appeals declined to stay the judgment. On October 12, 2023, the Rome Court of Appeals published its decision affirming the lower court's judgment on liability but reducing the amount of damages to €3,865,161 plus interests and costs. Vimeo has appealed to the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation and the case is currently pending (No. 856/2024).

To pursue enforcement of the judgments in the United States, RTI initially commenced a lawsuit against Vimeo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 26, 2020 to enforce the June 2019 judgment. See Reti Televisive Italiane s.p.a. v. Vimeo, LLC, No. 20 Civ. 8954 (S.D.N.Y.). On December 22, 2020, Vimeo and RTI filed, and the district court entered, a stipulation and order staying the U.S. proceedings pending the final outcome of the appeals from the Italian judgment at issue. On June 1, 2023, RTI filed an action in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County to enforce the Civil Court's judgment of €8,500 ,000 (No. 652646/2023). The case was removed to federal court and is now pending in the Southern District of New York. See Reti Televisive Italiane S.p.A. v. Vimeo.com, Inc, No. 23 Civ. 05488 (S.D.N.Y.). On October 20, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order lifting the stay of the U.S. enforcement proceedings in the first case (No. 20 Civ. 8954) and consolidating the two enforcement proceedings (No. 20 Civ. 8954 and No. 23 Civ. 05488). Vimeo has filed a Motion for Summary Judgement or, in the Alternative, to Stay the Case.

On April 7, 2023, the Civil Court of Rome published a decision finding in favor of Vimeo and dismissing the third case (No. 59780/2017) in its entirety. On October 9, 2023, RTI served Vimeo with its appeal challenging the co urt's decision in the third case. The case is currently pending before the appellate court (No. 5033/2023).

On October 18, 2022, the Civil Court of Rome issued a decision in the fourth case, Medusa Film v. Vimeo, Inc. (No. 74775/2017) finding liability but rejecting RTI's damage calculation and reserving judgment as to the amount of damages. On November 30, 2022, RTI served a notice of appeal challenging the court's decision on damages. The case is currently pending before the appellate court (No. 6536/2022).

On June 26, 2024, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuits pending in Italy and the consolidated enforcement action pending in New York. The settlement agreement included a payment to the plaintiffs, which did not have a material impact on Vimeo's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, on July 12, 2024, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal of the consolidated enforcement action in the Southern District of New York (No. 23 Civ. 05488), and the case is now closed. On July 18, 2024, the parties filed Joint Stipulations of Dismissal to resolve the cases pending in the Civil Court of Rome (No. 74775/2017), the Rome Court of Appeals (Nos. 6536/2022 and 5033/2023), and the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation (Nos. 26719/2022 and 856/2024). The Italian courts are expected to issue orders declaring that the cases are closed in the coming weeks.

## Sony/Universal/Warner Copyright Litigation

In March 2021, Sony Music Entertainment Italy (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Group), Warner Music Italia (a subsidiary of Warner Music Group), Universal Music Italia (a subsidiary of Universal Music Group), and Warner Music International Services (a subsidiary of Warner Music Group) filed a lawsuit against Vimeo in the Court of Milan alleging violations of Italian copyright and unfair competition laws. See Sony Music Entertainment Italy s.p.a. et al. v. Vimeo, Inc. , Case No. 10977/2021 (Court of Milan, Business Division). The complaint alleges that Vimeo infringed plaintiffs' copyrights by hosting and streaming user-uploaded videos that contain plaintiffs' copyrighted works and that, upon notification of the alleged infringement, Vimeo employed a takedown process that did not comply with Italian law. The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and damages to be quantified in a separate proceeding. Additionally, the complaint seeks potential penalties of €10,000 per day of delay in removing unauthorized works after receipt of a court order to do so, if applicable. On November 3, 2021, Vimeo filed its initial brief. On November 23, 2021, the parties attended the initial hearing with the Court of Milan where the court set forth a briefing schedule. The p arties have exchanged briefs, and the hearing scheduled for June 26, 2024 was postponed to October 16, 2024.

## MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

Vimeo is the world's leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service model. Vimeo's comprehensive and cloud-based tools empower its users to create, collaborate and communicate with video on a single, turnkey platform.

## Sources of Revenue

Vimeo's revenue is derived primarily from SaaS subscription fees paid by customers for subscription plans. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription periods generally range from one month to three years with the most common being an annual subscription and are generally non-cancellable.

## Distribution, Marketing and Advertiser Relationships

Vimeo pays to market and distribute its services on third-party search engines and social media websites, and through e-mail campaigns, display advertising, video advertising and affiliate marketing. Vimeo also pays traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. These distribution channels might also offer other third parties services and products, which compete with those Vimeo offers.

Vimeo also markets and offers its services and products through branded websites, allowing customers to transact directly with it in a convenient manner.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023

For a reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA, see " Principles of Financial Reporting ."

For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023

Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.3 million to $16.3 million, primarily due to an increase in gross profit driven by higher revenue and decreases in advertising costs and compensation expense and other employee-related costs.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023

Adjusted EBITDA increased $20.3 million to $28.5 million, primarily due to an increase in gross profit driven by higher revenue and decreases in advertising costs and compensation expense and other employee-related costs.

## PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

We have provided Adjusted EBITDA in this report to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing our financial results and believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present a similar non-GAAP financial measure. However, our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the presentation of similarly titled measures by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the metrics on which our internal budgets are based and also one of the metrics by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and corresponding non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.

## Definition of Non-GAAP Measure

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets, (ii) impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (iii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (4) restructuring costs associated with exit or disposal activities such as a reduction-in-force. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are either non-cash or non-recurring in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.

The reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

## Items That Are Excluded From Non-GAAP Measure

Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense associated with the grants of Vimeo stock-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base. We also consider the dilutive impact of stock-based awards in GAAP diluted earnings per share, to the extent such impact is dilutive.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our leasehold improvements and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.

Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer relationships, technology and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

Restructuring costs consist of costs associated with exit or disposal activities such as severance and other post-employment benefits paid in connection with a reductionin-force. We consider these costs to be non-recurring in nature and therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net earnings adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital.

## 2024

Adjustments to net earnings consisted primarily of $15.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and non-cash lease expense of $2.3 million. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $13.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.9 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities is driven by the payment of 2023 annual cash bonuses in 2024, partially offset by accruals for 2024 annual cash bonuses. The decrease from prepaid expense and other assets was due to the timing of invoice payments.

Net cash used in investing activities included $0.2 million of capital expenditures.

Net cash used in financing activities included $11.5 million of common stock repurchases and $3.9 million of withholding taxes paid related to the settlement of equity awards.

## 2023

Adjustments to net earnings consisted primarily of non-cash lease expense of $2.3 million and amortization of intangibles of $2.1 million. The increase from changes in working capital consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $8.4 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $11.4 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to growth in Vimeo Enterprise bookings. The decre ase in accounts receivable was due primarily t o a decrease in aged accounts receivable balances driven by improved cash collections. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities was due primarily to the payment of 2022 annual cash bonuses in 2023, the timing of invoice payments, and payment of the WIREWAX contingent consideration arrangement (the portion that was in excess of the amount recorded in purchase accounting and as described in " Note 4-Fair Value Measurements "), partially offset by accruals for 2023 cash bonuses.

Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds of $0.6 million previously held in escrow related to the sale of Vimeo's retained interest in its former hardware business.

Net cash used in financing activities included withholding taxes paid related to the exercise of equity awards of $4.2 million and $3.3 million related to the WIREWAX contingent consideration arrangement (the portion up to the amount recorded in purchase accounting as described in " Note 4-Fair Value Measurements ").

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

## Share Repurchase Authorizations and Activity

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 3.0 million shares of its common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average cost of $3.88 per share, or in aggregate $11.8 million.

Subsequent to June 30, 2024 and through August 1, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average cost of $3.74 per share, or in aggregate $4.6 million. At August 1, 2024, the Company has $33.7 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

## Outstanding Stock-Based Awards

Stock-based awards are settled in shares of Vimeo common stock and may be settled on a gross or net basis based upon factors deemed relevant at the time. Currently, stock-based awards are generally settled on a net basis, such that individual award holders will receive shares of Vimeo common stock, net of a number of shares of Vimeo common stock equal to the required cash tax withholding payment, which will be paid by Vimeo on the employee's behalf.

## Liquidity Assessment

At June 30, 2024, Vimeo had $310.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Vimeo believes its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's forecast indicates that it may not meet the minimum commitment of a non-cancellable cloud computing arrangement which expires in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as a result, could incur additional costs. Vimeo does not currently expect to incur significant capital expenditures.

Vimeo's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services, or the occurrence of unexpected expenses. Vimeo may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financings to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to Vimeo or at all.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

There have been no material changes in our market risk as compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Vimeo monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to improve their overall effectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, Vimeo modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), Vimeo's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, evaluated the effectiveness of Vimeo's disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that Vimeo's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to Vimeo's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Vimeo's internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Vimeo's management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

We have been targeted with cyberattacks in the past and may be targeted again. Potential attackers span a spectrum from unsophisticated amateurs to highly advanced organizations supported by state actors and use a variety of vectors, including malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering. Malicious actors may seek to impede our services (e.g., a denial-of-service attack) or infiltrate our systems for the purpose of introducing malware (e.g., ransomware), deleting or corrupting data, or exfiltrating data. Other undesirable acts may include the unauthorized use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms of service, contracts, or policies, such as the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, activities that threaten people's safety online or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, or data harvesting. For example, third parties often attempt to access and collect our site data through "scraping" and other unauthorized mechanisms for unauthorized purposes, which could include distributing such data to other parties for commercial purposes or training AI models for commercial purposes. Our users and subscribers could also be targeted by malicious actors. In the past, we have had instances in which user passwords were guessed by malicious actors or were exposed in breaches of other companies and then used by malicious actors to access the user's account in our system. Additionally, we have experienced cases where user error has caused private data to be exposed. Incidents affecting user data, regardless of the cause, take time for us to investigate and can be frustrating for our users.

Any of these types of activities may cause significant and lasting negative consequences. Appropriately responding to and remediating such activities may incur significant expense, and could result in severely diminished operational capacity and the loss of data necessary to operate. If a security incident results in a data breach, we may be subject to legal liability. Even if financial, legal, or operational harm is avoided, an incident could cause persistent reputational harm to our company. Moreover, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect, appropriately react and respond to, or implement effective preventative measures against, such incidents, including being unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies. Like other global companies, we face an increasingly difficult challenge to attract and retain highly qualified security personnel to assist us in combating these security threats.

## We may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials.

In the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act ("Section 230") generally limits our liability for hosting tortious and otherwise illegal content. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could be narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action, or judicial interpretation. In 2018, Congress amended Section 230 to remove immunities for content that promotes or facilitates sex trafficking and prostitution. In more recent sessions of Congress, multiple bills have been introduced to further limit Section 230. Some bills would repeal or substantially curtail Section 230, while some exempt specific claims or categories of content from Section 230's reach. In May 2024, the Energy and Commerce Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives held a Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing on a proposal to sunset Section 230. While no draft legislation has formally been introduced yet, this is one of various congressional efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230, so the possibility of congressional action remains. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230, we may no longer be afforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230.

## Table of Contents

Laws like Section 230 generally do not exist outside of the United States, and some countries have enacted laws that require online content providers to remove certain pieces of content within short time frames. If we fail to comply with such laws, we could be subject to prosecution or regulatory proceedings. In addition, some countries may decide to ban our service based upon a single piece of content. We have been subject to temporary bans in certain countries, including India, Russia and Turkey, for hosting content that those governments determined to be illegal.

We may also face liability when we remove content and accounts that we believe are violating our acceptable use policy, and we have been sued in the past for certain content-removal decisions. While we believe that Section 230 allows us to restrict or remove certain categories of content, its protections may not always end a lawsuit at an early stage, potentially resulting in costly and time-consuming litigation.

## We depend on key third-party vendors to provide core services.

We depend on third-party vendors to, among other things, provide customer support, develop software, host videos uploaded by our users, transcode videos (compressing a video file and converting it into a standard format optimized for streaming), stream videos to viewers and process payments. Specifically, Google Cloud Platform ("GCP") provides us with hosting and computing services, Amazon Web Services ("AWS") provides us with hosting services and we use multiple CDNs to deliver traffic worldwide. Certain of these third-party vendors have experienced outages in the past that have caused key Vimeo video services to be unavailable for several hours. We do not have automated cross-vendor redundancy for GCP or AWS. Consequently, outages in those services materially affect our video services. Outages may expose us to having to offer credits to subscribers, loss of subscribers and reputational damage. We may not be able to fully offset these losses with any credits we might receive from our vendors. Further, if any of these third-party vendors shut down services, we may be required to transition to different vendors. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one vendor to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to replace one or more major vendors with another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on a short timeframe. Additionally, our forecast indicates that we may not meet the minimum commitment of a non-cancellable cloud computing arrangement which expires in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as a result, we could incur additional costs.
