## SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "will," "may, "could," "should," "would," "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "projects," "forecasts," "intends," "targets," "seeks" and "believes," as well as variations of these words, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to Vimeo's future results of operations and financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations.

Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forwardlooking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:

- · we have a history of losses,
- · our prior rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance,
- · our limited operating history as a pure software-as-a-service ("SaaS") company and our limited history of selling such plans on a sales-assisted basis,
- · our total addressable market may prove to be smaller than we expect,
- · our ability to read data and make forecasts may be limited,
- · we may not have the right product/market fit,
- · we may not be able to attract free users or paid subscribers,
- · we may not be able to convert our free users into paid subscribers,
- · competition in our market is intense,
- · we may not be able to scale our business effectively,
- · we may need additional funding as we continue to grow our business,
- · we may experience service interruptions,
- · hosting and delivery costs may increase unexpectedly,
- · weakened global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and results of operations,
- · our business involves hosting large quantities of user content,
- · we have been sued for hosting content that allegedly infringed on a third-party copyright,
- · we may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials,
- · we have faced negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law,
- · we collect, store and process large amounts of content and personal information and any loss of or unauthorized access to such data could materially impact our business,
- · the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain,
- · our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our information technology systems and infrastructures,
- · we have been the target of cyberattacks by malicious actors, and
- · the risks described in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forwardlooking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to this report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. Any forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking information or statements, whether written or oral, to reflect any change, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

## NOTE 1-ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

## Description of Business

Vimeo is the world's leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service model. Vimeo's comprehensive and cloud-based tools empower its users to create, collaborate and communicate with video on a single, turnkey platform.

As used herein, "Vimeo," "we," "our" or "us" and similar terms in these consolidated financial statements refer to Vimeo, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).

## Spin-off

On May 25, 2021, Vimeo completed its separation from IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC") through a series of transactions (which we refer to as the "Spin-off") that resulted in the pre-transaction stockholders of IAC directly owning shares in both IAC and Vimeo, and in Vimeo becoming a separately traded public company. For more information regarding the Spin-off, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

## Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

All intercompany transactions and balances between and among Vimeo and its subsidiaries have been eliminated. All related party transactions between Vimeo and IAC and its subsidiaries, other than amounts related to the settlement of equity awards are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities. Amounts related to the settlement of equity awards are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as financing activities.

All related party balances between Vimeo and IAC and its subsidiaries are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet within "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities".

## Accounting Estimates

Management of Vimeo is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include those related to: the carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for credit losses; the determination of the estimated customer relationship period for certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer; the carrying value of right-of-use assets ("ROU assets"); the useful lives and recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives; the recoverability of goodwill; contingencies; unrecognized tax benefits; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the fair value of and forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others. Vimeo bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets and other factors that Vimeo considers relevant.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of Vimeo.

## Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

## NOTE 2-REVENUE

## Revenue Recognition

Vimeo's revenue is derived primarily from SaaS subscription fees paid by customers. Revenue, in the amount that reflects the consideration Vimeo expects to be entitled to, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription periods generally range from one month to three years with the most common being an annual subscription and are generally non-cancellable.

## Disaggregated revenue is as follows:

## Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue consists of payments that are received or are contractually due in advance of Vimeo's performance. Vimeo's deferred revenue is reported on a contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Vimeo classifies deferred revenue as current when the term of the applicable subscription period or expected completion of its performance obligation is one year or less. The current and non-current deferred revenue balances are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows:

| | September 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Deferred revenue | 169,857 | 167,388 |

(Unaudited)

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Vimeo recognized $155.2 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Vimeo recognized $166.0 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021.

## Practical Expedients and Exemptions

Vimeo does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (ii) contracts with variable consideration that is allocated entirely to unsatisfied performance obligations or to a wholly unsatisfied promise accounted for under the series guidance, and (iii) contracts for which Vimeo recognizes revenue at the amount which Vimeo has the right to invoice for services performed.

## Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

Vimeo has determined that certain costs, primarily commissions paid to employees pursuant to certain sales incentive programs and mobile app store fees, meet the requirements to be capitalized as a cost of obtaining a contract. Commissions paid to employees pursuant to certain sales incentive programs are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period. Vimeo calculates the estimated customer relationship period as the average customer life, which is based on historical data. When customer renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission, the average customer life includes renewal periods. For sales incentive programs where the customer relationship period is one year or less, Vimeo has elected the practical expedient to expense the costs as incurred. Vimeo capitalizes and amortizes mobile app store fees over the term of the applicable subscription.

The current and non-current balances of capitalized costs to obtain a contract with a customer are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as follows:

| Prepaid expenses and other current assets | 4,921 | 4,168 |
| Other non-current assets | 8,163 | 7,988 |

## NOTE 3-INCOME TAXES

At the end of each interim period, Vimeo estimates the annual expected effective income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date earnings or loss with discrete items recorded in the period. The estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained, or Vimeo's tax environment changes.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Vimeo recorded an income tax provision of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, Vimeo recorded an income tax provision of $2.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Vimeo's largest deferred tax assets are tax attribute carryforwards as well as capitalized research and development expenses. Vimeo has recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits were $3.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively. If unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2023 are subsequently recognized, th ere would be no impact to income tax provision due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets . Vimeo believes no unrecognized tax benefits would decrease by September 30, 2024. Vimeo recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if applicable, in income tax provision. There are currently no accruals for interest or penalties.

## Contingent Consideration Arrangements

The contingent consideration arrangement for Wibbitz Ltd. ("Wibbitz"), the acquisition of which the Company completed on November 10, 2021, was based upon the amount of annual recurring revenue ("ARR") from Wibbitz subscribers who were expected to migrate to the Vimeo platform. In the third quarter of 2023, the contingent consideration arrangement was finalized, which resulted in a payment of $2.5 million to Wibbitz's former shareholders, and a $0.5 million gain was recorded within "General and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, the final $2.5 million payment is included in "Contingent consideration payment" within financing activities.

The contingent consideration arrangement for WIREWAX Ltd. ("WIREWAX"), the acquisition of which the Company completed on December 6, 2021, was based upon achievement of an integration milestone and attainment of certain ARR thresholds within two years of the acquisition. In the first quarter of 2023, WIREWAX achieved the ARR threshold that resulted in a payment of $5.0 million to its former shareholders and a $0.1 million loss was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was recorded within "General and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, the final $5.0 million payment is included in "Contingent consideration payment" within financing activities and "Accounts payable and other liabilities" within operating activities for $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Additionally, the integration milestone was met in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a payment of $4.8 million, which was consistent with the fair value estimated as of the acquisition date and is included in "Contingent consideration payment" within financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows.

## NOTE 8-STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

## Vimeo Restricted Shares

On March 23, 2023, the Company announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC that Joseph Levin, Chairman and member of the Board and IAC's Chief Executive Officer, submitted his resignation as Chairman and member of the Board, effective immediately. Mr. Levin's resignation was not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company or the Board. Mr. Levin now serves as Special Advisor to the Board.

In connection with Mr. Levin's resignation, the Company entered into an amended and restated Restricted Stock Agreement, dated as of March 20, 2023 (the "Amended RSA") to the Restricted Stock Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2021, by and between the Company and Mr. Levin (the "RSA"). Pursuant to the Amended RSA, the RSA will continue in connection with Mr. Levin's service as Special Advisor to the Board. In consideration of Mr. Levin's reduced services as Special Advisor in comparison to his services previously provided as Chairman and Board member, the Amended RSA reduces the total number of shares of Vimeo common stock underlying the RSA by onethird, to a total of 3,247,000 shares ("Vimeo Restricted Shares"), that cliff vest on November 5, 2030 based on satisfaction of certain Vimeo stock price targets and Mr. Levin's continuous service as a Special Advisor through the vesting date.

Mr. Levin may elect to accelerate vesting of the Vimeo Restricted Shares, effective on November 5, 2026 and each year thereafter through November 5, 2029, in which case performance will be measured through such date, and Mr. Levin will receive a pro-rated portion of the award and any remaining shares will be forfeited. The applicable stock price goals are proportionately lower on the earlier vesting dates.

The Company accounted for these changes as a modification of the Vimeo Restricted Shares because the service condition of the RSA was not met due to Mr. Levin's resignation as Chairman of the Board, but the RSA will continue in connection with Mr. Levin's reduced services as Special Advisor. Accordingly, in the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company reversed $14.8 million of stock-based compensation expense which represents the cumulative amount of such stock-based compensation expense recognized in "General and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations since entering into the RSA with Mr. Levin. The fair value of the Vimeo Restricted Shares underlying the Amended RSA on the modification date was $2.3 million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining requisite service period through November 5, 2030, subject to Mr. Levin's continued service as Special Advisor. The fair value of the Vimeo Restricted Shares was determined using a lattice model that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation of Vimeo's stock price as this award contains a market condition.

## CEO Market-Based Award

On March 21, 2023, the Company and Anjali Sud, Vimeo's CEO, entered into an Amended and Restated Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Amended RSU Agreement"), which amended and restated the existing Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement between the Company and Ms. Sud dated March 25, 2022 (the "Original Award Agreement") to revise the vesting schedule and stock performance targets of the Original Award Agreement. The Company accounted for these changes as a modification, which was originally expected to result in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million. On July 5, 2023, the Company announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC that Ms. Sud notified the Company on June 30, 2023 of her intention to step down from her role as CEO effective as of August 31, 2023, and as a result, this award was forfeited upon Ms. Sud's departure.

## NOTE 9-EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Vimeo common stock and Class B common stock are treated as one class of common stock for earnings per share ("EPS") purposes as both classes of common stock participate in earnings, dividends and other distributions on the same basis. Vimeo calculates basic EPS using the two-class method since the Vimeo Restricted Shares are participating securities as they are unvested and have a non-forfeitable dividend right in the event the Company declares a cash dividend to common shareholders and participates in all other distributions of the Company in the same manner as all other Vimeo common shareholders. Diluted EPS is calculated, on the most dilutive basis, which excludes equity awards that would be anti-dilutive.

The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is as follows:

## NOTE 11-CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of business, Vimeo is, and from time to time may become, a party to various legal proceedings. Vimeo establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where it believes an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against Vimeo, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of Vimeo, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. Vimeo also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of Vimeo. See "Note 3-Income Taxes" for additional information related to income tax contingencies.

## EMI/Capitol Records Copyright Infringement Litigation

In December 2009, a group of music publishers owned by EMI Music Publishing (now owned by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment) and a group of then EMI-affiliated record companies, including Capitol Records (now owned by Universal Music Group), filed two lawsuits against Vimeo and its former owner, Connected Ventures, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. See Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC , No. 09 Civ. 10101 (S.D.N.Y.) and EMI Blackwood Music, Inc. v. Vimeo, LLC , No. 09 Civ. 10105 (S.D.N.Y.). In both cases, plaintiffs allege that Vimeo infringed their music copyrights (in the publishers' musical compositions and the record companies' sound recordings) by hosting and streaming videos uploaded by users (and in certain cases, former employees) featuring their musical works. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief and monetary damages. The initial complaints identified 199 videos as infringing (which Vimeo removed post-suit).

Prior to suit, plaintiffs did not avail themselves of their right to submit a takedown notice to Vimeo pursuant to the online safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), which limits the liability of online service providers for copyright infringement of their users when the provider takes certain measures. Vimeo asserts that the DMCA limits its liability because it complies with the DMCA and plaintiffs failed to submit takedown notices. Plaintiffs disagree, asserting various theories as to why the DMCA may not apply to some or all of the videos-in-suit.

The district court bifurcated proceedings and required the parties to first litigate the issue of whether Vimeo satisfied the DMCA's safe harbor provisions. On September 18, 2013, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Vimeo on 144 of the 199 original videos-in-suit on the ground that Vimeo complied with the threshold requirements of the DMCA and that there was no evidence that a Vimeo employee had watched the videos in question such that Vimeo had actual or "red flag" knowledge of infringement, which would disqualify the DMCA's application. The court denied summary judgment as to 35 videos-in-suit on the ground that there was a material question of fact as to whether Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge of infringement based upon employees having watched all or part of these videos. The court further held that the DMCA did not apply to the record companies' state-law claims regarding sound recordings fixed before February 1972; a trial was necessary to determine whether Vimeo was liable for employees who uploaded approximately 20 videos; and that plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their complaints to add over1,500 videos allegedly infringing their copyrights (which Vimeo removed after receiving plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint).

Vimeo sought and obtained the right to appeal certain issues on an interlocutory basis to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On June 16, 2016, the Second Circuit held that (1) the district court had applied the incorrect summary-judgment standard for "red flag" infringement and that evidence that an employee watched all or part of a video containing plaintiffs' music did not raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge in such video; (2) the DMCA applies to state-law copyright infringement claims predicated on pre-1972 sound recordings; and (3) on an issue raised by plaintiffs in their cross-appeal, the record did not show that Vimeo was willfully blind towards infringing activity taking place on its platform. As a result of these rulings, the Second Circuit partially vacated the district court's ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its judgment.

On March 31, 2018, the district court granted Vimeo's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' state-law unfair competition claims on the grounds that they were state-law copyright claims covered by the DMCA per the Second Circuit's judgment. On May 28, 2021, the district court granted Vimeo summary judgment as to videos for which the sole remaining basis of liability was the assertion that Vimeo had "red flag" knowledge of infringement. On August 26, 2021, the district court approved a stipulation whereby plaintiffs agreed to conditionally dismiss all remaining claims to allow a final judgment to issue. Under the stipulation, plaintiffs may refile their claims regarding the alleged employee-uploaded videos if the Second Circuit reverses the district court's other rulings in whole or in part. On November 1, 2021, the district court entered a final judgment adopting the terms of the parties' stipulation. On November 29, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeal has been fully briefed and argued.

Vimeo believes that the allegations in these lawsuits are without merit and will defend vigorously against them.

## MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW

Vimeo is the world's leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service model. Vimeo's comprehensive and cloud-based tools empower its users to create, collaborate and communicate with video on a single, turnkey platform.

## Sources of Revenue

Vimeo's revenue is derived primarily from SaaS subscription fees paid by customers for subscription plans. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription periods generally range from one month to three years with the most common being an annual subscription and are generally non-cancellable.

## Distribution, Marketing and Advertiser Relationships

Vimeo pays to market and distribute its services on third-party search engines and social media websites, and through e-mail campaigns, display advertising, video advertising and affiliate marketing. Vimeo also pays traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. These distribution channels might also offer other third parties services and products, which compete with those Vimeo offers.

Vimeo also markets and offers its services and products through branded websites, allowing customers to transact directly with it in a convenient manner. Vimeo has made significant investments, and expects to scale investments, in online marketing to drive traffic to its websites.

Cost of revenue decreased $10.6 million, or 13%, due primarily to decreases of $5.4 million in hosting fees driven by cost optimization initiatives, $2.2 million in customer care personnel costs driven by lower outsourced costs, $1.2 million in in-app purchase fees as the Company is actively deprecating the consumer-facing portion of the Magisto business, and $1.2 million in credit card processing fees driven by lower Bookings from Self-Serve & Add-Ons.

Gross profit decreased $5.2 million, or 2%, due primarily to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by cost optimization initiatives for hosting which as a percentage of revenue decreased.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022

Research and development expense decreased $11.2 million, or 33%, due primarily to decreases of $5.8 million in stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in compensation expense and other employee-related costs, both driven by a decrease in headcount. Additionally, the third quarter of 2022 included restructuring costs of $2.3 million associated with a reduction-in-force.

Sales and marketing expense decreased $6.9 million, or 16%, due primarily to decreases of $3.3 million in advertising costs as we focus on higher-efficiency customer acquisition channels, $1.5 million in compensation expense and other employee-related costs driven by a decrease in headcount. Additionally, the third quarter of 2022 included restructuring costs of $1.1 million associated with a reduction-in-force.

General and administrative expense decreased $8.1 million, or 30%, due primarily to decreases of $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and $1.1 million in compensation expense and other employee-related costs driven by lower usage of temporary resources. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was driven by the resignation of Vimeo's former Chairman of the Board and corresponding modification of the Vimeo Restricted Shares and the forfeiture of unvested equity awards held by Vimeo's former CEO upon her resignation.

Depreciation was nearly flat compared to the prior year period.

Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.9 million due primarily to certain intangible assets related to the 2019 acquisition of Magisto reaching the end of their estimated useful lives in the second quarter of 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022

Research and development expense decreased $23.4 million, or 22%, due primarily to decreases of $14.4 million in compensation expense and other employee-related costs and $7.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, both driven by a decrease in headcount.

Sales and marketing expense decreased $13.3 million, or 10%, due primarily to a decrease of $13.1 million in advertising costs as we focus on higher-efficiency customer acquisition channels.

General and administrative expense decreased $50.1 million, or 59%, due primarily to decreases of $40.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and $7.4 million in provision for credit losses driven by a decrease in aged accounts receivable balances as a result of improved cash collections. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was driven by the resignation of Vimeo's former Chairman of the Board and corresponding modification of the Vimeo Restricted Shares and the forfeiture of unvested equity awards held by Vimeo's former CEO upon her resignation.

Depreciation decreased $0.9 million due primarily to fully depreciating certain leasehold improvements and equipment in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the Company's decision to not renew its lease for the office space it occupied in IAC's headquarters, partially offset by costs associated with an asset retirement obligation incurred in the first quarter of 2023.

Amortization of intangibles decreased $1.4 million due primarily to the factor described above in the three-month discussion.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022

Operating income (loss) increased $28.6 million due to an increase in gross profit of $1.6 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $27.0 million. The increase in gross profit was due to improved gross margin (79% in 2023 compared to 77% in 2022), partially offset by lower revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to decreases in stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million, compensation expense and other employee-related costs of $5.3 million, restructuring costs of $4.2 million associated with the reduction-in-force completed in the third quarter of 2022, and advertising costs of $3.3 million.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022

Operating income (loss) increased $83.9 million due to a decrease in gross profit of $5.2 million, more than offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $89.1 million. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower revenue, partially offset by improved gross margin (78% in 2023 compared to 76% in 2022). The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to decreases in stock-based compensation expense of $46.9 million, compensation and other employee-related costs of $17.1 million, advertising costs of $13.1 million, and provision for credit losses of $7.4 million.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022

Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.7 million to $12.8 million, primarily due to an increase in gross profit and decreases in compensation expense and other employeerelated costs and advertising costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022

Adjusted EBITDA increased $35.8 million to $21.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit, more than offset by decreases in compensation expense and other employee-related costs, advertising costs, and provision for credit losses.

Interest expense decreased $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the termination of the Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the recognition of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the Credit Facility in the second quarter of 2023.

Other income, net increased $1.5 million and $5.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due primarily to the increase in Interest income driven by an increase in interest rates on the Company's money market funds, partially offset by lower foreign currency remeasurement gains.

Income tax provision increased as a result of an increase in earnings before income taxes. The difference between the effective income tax rate and federal statutory rate primarily relates to the effects of international tax provisions as required under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, stock-based awards, and movements in the valuation allowance.

## PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

We have provided Adjusted EBITDA in this report to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing our financial results and believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present a similar non-GAAP financial measure. However, our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the presentation of similarly titled measures by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the metrics on which our internal budgets are based and also one of the metrics by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and corresponding non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.

## Definition of Non-GAAP Measure

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income (loss) excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets, (ii) impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (iii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (4) restructuring costs associated with exit or disposal activities such as a reduction-in-force. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are either non-cash or non-recurring in nature. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses.

The reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

## Items That Are Excluded From Non-GAAP Measure

Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense associated with the grants of Vimeo stock-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base. We also consider the dilutive impact of stock-based awards in GAAP diluted earnings per share, to the extent such impact is dilutive.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our leasehold improvements and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.

Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer relationships, technology and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

Restructuring costs consist of costs associated with exit or disposal activities such as severance and other post-employment benefits paid in connection with a reductionin-force. We consider these costs to be non-recurring in nature and therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.

Vimeo's international cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences.

## Cash Flow Information

In summary, Vimeo's cash flows are as follows:

| | Nine Months Ended September 30, | Nine Months Ended September 30, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2022 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Net cash provided by (used in) | | |
| Operating activities | 27,803 | $ (38,756) |
| Investing activities | 531 | $ 962 |
| Financing activities | (11,603) | $ (10,579) |

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities consists of net earnings (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital.

## 2023

Adjustments to net earnings consisted primarily of $5.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense of $3.4 million, and amortization of intangibles of $2.5 million. The increase from changes in working capital consisted of an increase of $5.0 million in deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $6.2 million in accounts payable and other liabilities. The increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to growth in Vimeo Enterprise bookings. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarilyto a decrease in aged accounts receivable balances driven by improved cash collections. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities was due primarily to the payment of 2022 cash bonuses in 2023, lease payments, payment of a contingent consideration arrangement (the portion that was in excess of the amount recorded in purchase accounting and as described in " Note 4-Fair Value Measurements "), and the timing of invoice and accrual payments, partially offset by accruals for 2023 cash bonuses expected to be paid in 2024.

Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds of $0.6 million previously held in escrow related to the sale of Vimeo's retained interest in its former hardware business.

Net cash used in financing activities included $5.8 million related to contingent consideration arrangements (the portion up to the amount recorded in purchase accounting as described in " Note 4-Fair Value Measurements ") and $5.7 million of withholding taxes paid related to the exercise of equity awards.

## 2022

Adjustments to net loss consisted primarily of $52.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, provision for credit losses of $7.8 million, non-cash lease expense of $4.6 million, $3.9 million of amortization of intangibles, and $2.1 million of depreciation. The decrease from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $19.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $11.9 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities was due primarily to the timing of invoice payments, the payment of 2021 cash bonuses in 2022, and lease payments, partially offset by accruals related to 2022 cash bonuses expected to be paid in 2023. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to the implementation of a new billing system.

## Table of Contents

Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds of $1.6 million previously held in escrow related to the sale of Vimeo's retained interest in its former hardware business, partially offset by capital expenditures of $0.7 million.

Net cash used in financing activities reflected the timing of net withholding taxes paid related to the exercise of equity awards of $5.2 million and the $4.8 million payment in July 2022 related to the WIREWAX contingent consideration arrangement (as described in " Note 4-Fair Value Measurements ").

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

## Outstanding Stock-Based Awards

Stock-based awards are settled in shares of Vimeo common stock and may be settled on a gross or net basis based upon factors deemed relevant at the time. Since the Spin-off and through December 31, 2022, stock-based awards were generally settled on a gross basis, such that individual award holders were required to pay their withholding tax obligation, which they were generally able to do by selling shares of Vimeo common stock (including a portion of the shares received in connection with the applicable settlement). Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, stock-based awards have been generally settled on a net basis, such that individual award holders received shares of Vimeo common stock, in each case, net of a number of shares of Vimeo common stock equal to the required cash tax withholding payment, which was paid by Vimeo on the employee's behalf.

## Liquidity Assessment

At September 30, 2023, Vimeo had $290.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Vimeo believes its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's forecast indicates that it may not meet the minimum commitment of a non-cancellable cloud computing arrangement which expires in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as a result, could incur additional costs. Vimeo does not currently expect to incur significant capital expenditures.

Vimeo's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services, or the occurrence of unexpected expenses. Vimeo may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financings to make additional acquisitions and investments or to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to Vimeo or at all.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

There have been no material changes in our market risk as compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023 as well as in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on May 4, 2023.

## Table of Contents

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Vimeo monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to improve their overall effectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, Vimeo modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), Vimeo's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, evaluated the effectiveness of Vimeo's disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that Vimeo's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to Vimeo's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Vimeo's internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Vimeo's management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The information set forth under " Note 11-Contingencies " in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the risk factors below and information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. These risks are not exclusive and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us.

## Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy

## We depend on key third-party vendors to provide core services .

We depend on third-party vendors to, among other things, provide customer support, develop software, host videos uploaded by our users, transcode videos (compressing a video file and converting it into a standard format optimized for streaming), stream videos to viewers and process payments. Specifically, Google Cloud Platform ("GCP") provides us with hosting and computing services, Amazon Web Services ("AWS") provides us with hosting services and we use multiple CDNs to deliver traffic worldwide. Certain of these third-party vendors have experienced outages in the past that have caused key Vimeo video services to be unavailable for several hours. We do not have automated cross-vendor redundancy for GCP or AWS. Consequently, outages in those services materially affect our video services. Outages may expose us to having to offer credits to subscribers, loss of subscribers and reputational damage. We may not be able to fully offset these losses with any credits we might receive from our vendors.

## Risks Related to Human Capital

Prolonged economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have impacted our teams and business operations.

Since 2017, we have had operations in Ukraine. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, we had 78 employees in Ukraine. Our Ukraine team is primarily focused on research and developments activities, with 68% of the team in engineering roles. On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result of this war, some of our Ukraine team members have been forced to relocate to other countries and within Ukraine, with many unable to perform all or some work duties. We remain committed to supporting our Ukraine team members and are prioritizing safety over work. The ongoing conflict could cause harm to our team members and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, as well as disrupt telecommunications systems, banks and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Ukraine. In addition, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States, European Union, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and Belarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian financial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or the SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be taken in future, by the U.S., NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could result in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new business opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.

## Table of Contents

Additionally, as of October 31, 2023, we had 99 employees in Israel. Our Israel team covers several areas of our business, from engineering and product to quality assurance and customer support. Due to the war between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023, some of our employees in Israel have been called to active military duty and we expect that additional employees may be called in the future, if needed. Additionally, we have been forced to close our Israel office or operate at limited capacity for several days and may need to do so again for an unknown period of time. As a result, our operations in Israel have been impacted, and may continue to be disrupted if this conflict continues for a significant period of time or if the situation further deteriorates. The safety and well-being of our employees takes precedence, and we will continue to evaluate the situation and adjust operation plans as needed.

## Risks Related to User Content and Personal Information

## Our business involves hosting large quantities of user content.

Our business is hosting video content supplied by others. Some of the videos uploaded to our platform will invariably violate a third party's rights or a law, rule or regulation, and if so, we could, in turn, face lawsuits, liability and negative publicity for hosting such content.

## We collect, store, and process large amounts of content and personal information and any loss of or unauthorized access to such data could materially impact our business.

We collect, store and process large amounts of content and personal information of our users. A significant portion of this data is private or intended for a limited audience. For example, one of our core product features is the ability of users to set privacy settings to their videos and thereby determine how the video is to be distributed. A large portion of the videos we host are not publicly available or are available only through channels determined by our users. In addition, we rely on user information, including automatically collected information, to operate our business.

Any partial failure of an information security control either resulting from an end user error, internal or external malfeasance, misconfiguration or an unknown or not yet remediated vulnerability may result in unauthorized access or inadvertent disclosure of such data. We routinely solicit and receive reports from security researchers regarding potential vulnerabilities in our applications or integrated third-party software.

A data breach could expose us to regulatory actions and litigation under applicable privacy laws. Depending on the circumstances, we may be required to disclose a suspected breach to regulators, enterprise customers, affected individuals and/or the public. This could lead to regulatory action including the possibility of fines, class-action or traditional litigation by affected individuals, reputational harm, costly investigation and remedial efforts, the triggering of indemnification obligations under data protection agreements with enterprise customers and partners and/or higher premiums for cyber insurance, as well as harm to our brand and customer confidence.

Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our information technology systems and infrastructures and on our ability to enhance, expand and adapt these systems and infrastructures in a timely and cost-effective manner.

In order for us to succeed, our information technology systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. We rely on information technology systems to keep financial records, facilitate our research and development initiatives, manage our manufacturing operations, maintain quality control, maintain corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems and those of our vendors and partners are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown, malicious intrusion, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software, or other disruptive events, including, but not limited to, natural disasters and catastrophes. In April 2023, we hired a new Chief Information Security Officer, who has undertaken a comprehensive review of our information security systems and processes. As a result, we have significantly increased our cybersecurity controls over the last six months. Significant work remains, but we expect to see additional incremental improvement in our cybersecurity risk management over the next six to twelve months.

We have identified vulnerabilities in our products and services as well as third-party and open-source software that we depend on in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future. While we are continually working to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems, we cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our software products and services that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We will continue to make prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in remediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact our users' experiences with our products, tarnish our brands' reputations and decrease demand for our products, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if detected, the resolution of such interruptions may take a long time, during which customers may not be able to access, or may have limited access to, the service.

As a highly visible brand, we continue to be the target of cyberattacks by malicious actors, and our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal information and confidential information that we (or our service providers or business partners) collect, store or process could trigger contractual and legal obligations, harm our reputation, subject us to liability and otherwise adversely affect our business including our financial results.

We have been targeted with cyberattacks in the past and may be targeted again. Potential attackers span a spectrum from unsophisticated amateurs to highly advanced organizations supported by state actors and use a variety of vectors, including malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering. Malicious actors may seek to impede our services (e.g., a denial-of-service attack) or infiltrate our systems for the purpose of introducing malware (e.g., ransomware), deleting or corrupting data, or exfiltrating data.

A cyberattack may cause significant and lasting negative consequences. We may face significant expense in responding to the attack, severely diminished operational capacity, and the loss of data necessary to operate. If the attack results in a data breach, we may be subject to legal liability. Even if financial, legal, or operational harm is avoided, an attack could cause persistent reputational harm to our company. Moreover, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect, appropriately react and respond to, or implement effective preventative measures against, all cybersecurity incidents. Like other global companies, we face an increasingly difficult challenge to attract and retain highly qualified security personnel to assist us in combating these security threats.

Our users and subscribers could also be targeted by malicious actors. In the past, we have had instances in which user passwords were guessed by malicious actors or were exposed in breaches of other services and then used by malicious actors to access the user's account in our system. These cases take time to remediate and are frustrating for our users and subscribers, some of whom may blame us for the situation. Additionally, we have experienced cases where user error has caused private data to be exposed. Incidents affecting user data, regardless of the cause, take time for us to investigate and can be frustrating for our users.

## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations

We and our service providers collect, process, transmit and store certain personal information from our users, which creates legal obligations and exposes us to potential liability under federal, state, and international laws applicable to privacy and data protection.

## Table of Contents

We are subject to a variety of existing and new laws concerning the collection, storing, processing, and transferring of user information. In the U.S., we are subject to federal laws, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Video Privacy Protection Act, as well as a variety of state laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Protection Act. Current or future privacy-related legislation and governmental regulations pertaining to the use of biometrics or other video analytics may affect how our business is conducted or expose us to unfavorable developments resulting from changes in the regulatory landscape. For example, laws such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act restrict the collection, use and storage of biometric information and provide a private right of action of persons who are aggrieved by violations of the act. Such legislation and regulations have exposed us to, and we expect that they will continue to expose us to, regulatory and litigation risks. Legislation and governmental regulations related to the use of biometrics and other video analytics may also influence our current and prospective customers' activities, as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and the risk of liability. It is also not clear how existing and future laws and regulations governing issues such as biometrics and other video analytics apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell. The failure to comply with applicable privacy laws could lead to regulatory actions, including the possibility of fines, class-action or traditional litigation, reputational harm and/or costly investigation and remediation efforts. We have been sued for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Protection Act (see the section entitled "Part 1. Item 13Commitments and Contingencies").

Outside of the U.S., we are subject to privacy laws of the countries in which we conduct business. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") imposes detailed requirements related to the collection, storage and use of personal information related to people located in the EU. The GDPR authorizes fines up to 4% of a company's annual turnover. Privacy laws have proliferated in the past several years, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Because of the speed of change in the area of privacy law, it is impossible to foresee changes in the regulatory environment and we may be forced to make sudden operational shifts in an effort to maintain compliance. New laws, or new interpretations of or stricter enforcement of existing laws, may increase our compliance costs, restrict our ability to determine how our users are using our services, and increase our potential liability in the event of non-compliance. For example, in Europe, we have had to make changes to how we use cookies and other tracking technologies and these changes have reduced our visibility into how our users are using our services.

## Our ability to transfer personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions may be restricted.

Some countries outside of the United States (including European Union member states, other members of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland and the United Kingdom) may limit the transfer of certain data regarding their residents to other countries. Such laws have the potential to adversely affect our business. For example, we rely on approved legal mechanisms for transferring personal information subject to GDPR. In 2020, one such mechanism, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, was invalidated in the Schrems II case by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which not only removed the Privacy Shield Framework as a valid mechanism for transfers to the U.S., but also called into question the validity of other commonly used data transfer mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses. Although the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("DPF"), a self-certification program that facilitates lawful cross-border transfers of personal information to companies in the U.S. in compliance with EU law, became effective in July 2023, it is still unclear whether EEA-based customers will be eager to rely on the DPF as a long-term solution given that legal challenges similar to Schrems II are expected to arise. The uncertainty around data transfers and global trends relating to national data localization could continue to present risks with respect to non-compliance, as well as increased costs to comply with complex and evolving requirements. Additionally, we continue to transfer data from the EU to the U.S. using alternative mechanisms including standard contractual clauses, which were updated in 2021. The use of standard contractual clauses to legalize transfers to the U.S. has been challenged. In addition, rulings by certain European data protection authorities have indicated that, in some cases, U.S.-based providers cannot legally import personal information from the EU due to their inability to ensure that the personal information of European residents is safeguarded from governmental interception or surveillance.

If we were unable to legally transfer personal information from the EU (or any other country) to the U.S., we could face fines for noncompliance and we may have to host personal information locally. Should this occur, we would face higher costs and operational challenges, which could adversely affect our business and gross margin. Additionally, this may adversely affect our enterprise business, including our financial results.
