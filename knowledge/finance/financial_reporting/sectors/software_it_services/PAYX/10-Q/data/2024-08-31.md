<h2>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)</h2>
<p>August 31, 2024</p>
<p>Note A: Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies</p>
<p>Description of business: Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "Paychex") is a leading provider of integrated human capital management ("HCM") solutions for human resources ("HR"), payroll, benefits, and insurance for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States ("U.S.") and parts of Europe. The Company also has operations in India. Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one segment.</p>
<p>Basis of presentation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company with all intercompany transactions eliminated. Certain disclosures are reported as zero balances due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of items of a normal recurring nature) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"). Operating results and cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025").</p>
<p>Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported consolidated earnings.</p>
<p>Revision to previously issued financial statements: The consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2023 includes a revision to previously reported amounts related to the presentation of the cash flows associated with short-term receivables purchased from the Company's clients under nonrecourse arrangements. The revision increased net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by investing activities by $37.2 million. Management concluded that this revision was not material to the financial statements of any previously filed annual or interim periods. This revision is reflected in this Form 10-Q and will be reflected in future filings.</p>
<p>Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are recorded at fair value, and consist of cash and cash equivalents, primarily money market securities, included in funds held for clients and cash that is restricted in use to secure commitments for certain workers' compensation insurance policies.</p>
<p>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses: Accounts receivable balances are shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance for credit losses of $25.0 million and $21.3 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. These balances include trade receivables for services provided to clients and receivables purchased from the Company's clients under non-recourse arrangements. Trade receivables were $162.5 million and $141.3 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Purchased receivables, at gross, were $988.7 million and $939.6 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>The Company is exposed to credit losses through the sale of services, payment of client obligations, and collection of purchased receivables. To mitigate this credit risk, the Company has multiple programs in place to assess and continuously monitor each client's ability to pay for these solutions and support. Credit monitoring programs include, but are not limited to, new client credit reviews, establishing appropriate credit limits, monitoring of credit distressed clients, and early electronic wire and collection procedures. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, client business type or strategy and may require collateralized asset support or prepayment to mitigate credit risk.</p>
<p>Accounts receivable are written off and charged against the allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted all collection efforts without success. The Company estimates its credit losses based on historical loss activity adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecast factors, when applicable. The provision for the allowance for credit losses and accounts written off were not material for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023. No single client had a material impact on total accounts receivable as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 or service revenue and results of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") unbilled receivables, net of advance collections: PEO unbilled receivables, including estimated revenues, offset by advance collections from clients, are recorded as PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, advance collections were $1.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively.</p>
<p>PEO insurance reserves: As part of its PEO solution, the Company offers workers' compensation insurance and health insurance coverage to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers' compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers' compensation insurance policies. Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling claims. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company has an aggregate maximum liability of $1.0 million for claims exceeding $1.0 million, and once met, the maximum individual claims liability is $1.0 million.</p>
<p>With respect to PEO health insurance coverage, the Company offers various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where the Company retains risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where the Company retains risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with the Company's service contract with the carrier. The claims reserve includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. The Company's maximum individual claims liability is $0.5 million under its policies covering both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>In establishing the PEO workers' compensation insurance reserves, the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. These reserves are subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers' compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends.</p>
<p>Stock-based compensation costs: The Company has issued stock-based awards to employees and members of its Board of Directors (the "Board") consisting of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. The Company accounts for all stock-based awards to employees and members of the Board as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation costs recognized were $16.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared with $16.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Recently adopted accounting pronouncements: There were no recently adopted accounting pronouncements during the three months ended August 31, 2024 that had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.</p>
<p>Recently issued accounting pronouncements: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures." This ASU expands public entities' segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. The requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and are required to be applied retrospectively. This ASU is applicable to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025, and subsequent interim periods, with early application permitted. The requirements of this ASU are disclosure-related and will not have an impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its reportable segment disclosures.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." This ASU updates income tax disclosure requirements primarily by requiring specific categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2025, with early application permitted. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. The requirements of this ASU are</p>
<p>disclosure-related and will not have an impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its income tax disclosures.</p>
<h2>Note B: Service Revenue</h2>
<p>Service revenue is primarily attributable to fees for providing services to the Company's clients and is recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to its clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for such services. Insurance Solutions revenue is commissions earned on premiums collected and remitted to insurance carriers. The Company's contracts generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with a 30-day notice of termination. Sales and other applicable non-payroll related taxes are excluded from service revenue.</p>
<p>Based upon similar operational and economic characteristics, the Company's service revenue is disaggregated by Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions as reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company believes these revenue categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.</p>
<h2>Management Solutions Revenue</h2>
<p>Management Solutions revenue is primarily derived from the Company's integrated HCM services and HR solutions. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. The Company's offerings often leverage the information gathered in its base payroll processing service, allowing it to provide comprehensive services covering the HCM spectrum. Management Solutions revenue is generally recognized over time as services are performed and the client simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.</p>
<p>Revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is also included in Management Solutions revenue in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Delivery service revenue is recognized at a point in time following the delivery of payroll checks, reports, quarter-end packages, and tax returns to the Company's clients.</p>
<h2>PEO and Insurance Solutions Revenue</h2>
<p>PEO solutions are sold through the Company's registered and licensed subsidiaries and offer businesses HCM and HR solutions. The Company serves as a co-employer of its clients' employees, offers health insurance coverage to client employees, and assumes the risks and rewards of workers' compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. PEO Solutions revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed and the client simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services. PEO Solutions revenue is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and health insurance premiums on guaranteed cost benefit plans. For workers' compensation and health insurance plans where the Company retains risk, revenues and costs are recorded on a gross basis.</p>
<p>PEO pass-through costs netted within the PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue were as follows:</p>

<p>Insurance solutions are sold through the Company's licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., which provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing companies to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers' compensation, business-owner policies, commercial auto, cyber security, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, life and disability. Insurance Solutions revenue reflects commissions earned on remitted insurance services premiums billed and is recognized over time as services are performed and the client simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.</p>
<h2>Contract Balances</h2>
<p>The timing of revenue recognition for Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients as they both occur during the respective client payroll period for which the services are provided. Therefore, the Company does not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing.</p>
<p>Payments received for certain of the Company's service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers revenue associated with these performance obligations, which exceed one year, and subsequently recognizes them as future services are provided, over approximately three to four years.</p>
<p>Changes in deferred revenue related to material rights that exceed one year were as follows:</p>

<h2>Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts</h2>
<p>The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. The Company also recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered.</p>
<p>Deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are reported in the prepaid expenses and other current assets and long-term deferred costs line items on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense related to costs to obtain and fulfill a contract are included in cost of service revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and recognized over the expected economic benefit period.</p>
<p>The Company regularly reviews its deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the three months ended August 31, 2024 or August 31, 2023.</p>

<h2>Note D: Business Combinations</h2>
<p>Effective July 31, 2023, substantially all of the net assets of Alterna Capital Solutions LLC ("Alterna"), were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Alterna purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition allows the Company to increase and diversify its portfolio of solutions and support serving small- to medium-sized businesses.

<p>The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. The Company believes the investments held as of August 31, 2024 that had gross unrealized losses of $98.0 million were not impaired due to credit risk or other valuation concerns, and the Company was not required to record a credit loss or an allowance for credit losses on its AFS securities. The Company believes it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms and that the unrealized losses on these securities were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. A substantial portion of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of August 31, 2024 and as of May 31, 2024 held an AA rating or better. The Company does not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believes that it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. The Company's assessment that an investment is not impaired due to credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company's strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.</p>
<p>Realized gains and losses on the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, realized gains and losses from the funds held for clients portfolio and corporate investments portfolio are included in interest on funds held for clients and other income, net, respectively.</p>

<p>Variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs"), when held by the Company, are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.</p>
<h2>Note G: Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting standards related to fair value measurements include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based on reliability, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company can access at the measurement date.</li>
<li>·Level 2 valuations are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability including the following:</li>
<li>oquoted prices for similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets;</li>
<li>oquoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;</li>
<li>oinputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instrument; or</li>
<li>oinputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.</li>
<li>·Level 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, when used by the Company, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as AFS and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.</p>
<p>The Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:</p>

<p>In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company predominately uses the market approach. Money market securities, which are cash equivalents, are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Cash equivalents also include U.S. government agency and treasury securities with original maturities of 90 days or less which are considered Level 2 investments as they are valued based on similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets. AFS securities, including asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and VRDNs, when held by the Company, are included in Level 2 and are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company's Level 2 AFS securities, the independent pricing service uses a variety of inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service because it believes that they are appropriately valued.</p>
<p>Assets included as other are mutual fund investments, consisting of participants' eligible deferral contributions under the Company's non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans. The related liability is reported as other long-term</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>liabilities. The mutual funds are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets.</p>
<p>The Company's long-term borrowings are accounted for on a historical cost basis. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the fair value of long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs was $397.0 million and $391.8 million for the Senior Notes, Series A, respectively, and $398.6 million and $386.0 million for the Senior Notes, Series B, respectively.</p>
<p>The Company's long-term borrowings are not traded in active markets, and as a result, its fair values were estimated using a market approach employing Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available based on loans with similar terms and maturities.</p>
<p>The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.</p>
<h2>Note H: Supplemental Information</h2>
<p>Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation: Depreciation expense was $27.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to $30.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization: Amortization expense relating to intangible assets was $11.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to $10.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Goodwill and intangible assets were recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2023 related to the acquisition of Alterna. The goodwill related to this acquisition is included in the Purchased Receivable reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Note D for additional information regarding this acquisition and the impact it had on goodwill and intangible assets. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss as it relates to its goodwill or intangible assets during the three months ended August 31, 2024 or August 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Short-term financing: Outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit facilities had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.50% and 6.14% as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The unused amount available under these credit facilities as of August 31, 2024 was approximately $2.0 billion.</p>
<p>The credit facilities contain various financial and operational covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements. The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of August 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Letters of credit: The Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $165.4 million and $168.5 million as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, primarily to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between October 02, 2024 and August 24, 2025. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit as of, or during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, or as of May 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Long-term debt: There have been no material changes to the Company's long-term debt agreement or balances subsequent to May 31, 2024. The Company's long-term debt agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements. The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of August 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Note I: Commitments and Contingencies</h2>
<p>Other commitments: The Company had outstanding commitments under existing workers' compensation insurance agreements and other legally binding contractual arrangements. The Company also enters into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business and had outstanding commitments to purchase capital assets of approximately $3.9 million as of August 31, 2024 and $2.9 million as of May 31, 2024.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its officers, directors, and fiduciaries of certain of our retirement plans,</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they relate to their services provided to the Company.</p>
<p>The Company currently self-insures the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate employee and PEO employee health and medical benefit plans. The Company's estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of August 31, 2024. The Company also maintains insurance, in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies, for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism, as well as capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its captive insurance company.</p>
<p>Contingencies: The Company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, employment-related claims, tax claims, statutory, and other matters.</p>
<p>The Company's management currently believes that resolution of any outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effects are recorded.</p>

<p>Total revenue increased to $1.3 billion for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 3% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the expiration of the Employee Retention Tax Credit ("ERTC") program and one less payroll processing day as compared with the prior year quarter, revenue growth was 7%. The changes in revenue as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Management Solutions revenue: $961.7 million for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 1%:</li>
<li>oGrowth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and client worksite employees for HR solutions;</li>
</ul>
<p>oHigher product penetration, including HR solutions and retirement; and</p>
<ul>
<li>oLower revenue from ancillary services, primarily due to the expiration of our ERTC Service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>· PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue: $319.3 million for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 7%:</h2>
<p>oGrowth in the number of average PEO worksite employees; and</p>
<p>oIncrease in PEO insurance revenues.</p>
<p>· Interest on funds held for clients: $37.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 15%, primarily due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances.</p>
<p>We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk.</p>

<p>In addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations' performance period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the SEC. As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>Our financial position as of August 31, 2024 remained strong with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion. Short-term borrowings of $18.9 million and long-term borrowings of $800.0 million were outstanding as of August 31, 2024. Our unused capacity under our unsecured credit facilities was approximately $2.0 billion as of August 31, 2024. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations, which was $546.1 million for the first quarter. Our positive cash flows have allowed us to support our business, and pay dividends. We currently anticipate that corporate cash, corporate restricted cash, and total corporate investments as of August 31, 2024, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support our business operations, capital purchases, primarily investment in our technology solutions, share repurchases, dividend payments, and the servicing of long-term debt for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow on our unsecured credit facilities or use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding needs related to client fund obligations. Historically, we have borrowed, typically on an overnight basis, to settle short-term client fund obligations, rather than liquidate previously collected client funds invested in our long-term AFS portfolio. We believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of August 31, 2024 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment. We do not intend to sell these investments until recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not more-than-likely that we would be required to sell these investments prior to that time.</p>
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p>Short-term financing: We maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations. The purpose of these credit facilities is to meet short-term funding requirements, finance working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. We typically borrow on an overnight or short-term basis under our credit facilities. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 for further discussion of our credit facilities.</p>

<p>We primarily use short-term borrowings to settle client fund obligations, rather than liquidating previously collected client funds invested in our long-term AFS investment portfolio.</p>
<p>Subsequent to August 31, 2024, we borrowed twice, on an overnight basis, $333.5 million on a weighted-average basis under our PNC and JPM credit facilities.</p>
<p>We expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs. However, if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in, but not limited to, Item 1A in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 and other SEC filings, we may need to adjust our capital, operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us. Furthermore, if we determine the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued and obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Letters of credit: As of August 31, 2024, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling $165.4 million, primarily to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between October 02, 2024 and August 24, 2025. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during the first quarter or as of August 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Long-term financing: We have borrowed $800.0 million through the issuance of long-term private placement debt. Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 for further discussion on our long-term financing.</p>
<p>Other commitments: We had outstanding commitments under existing workers' compensation insurance agreements and legally binding contractual arrangements. We also entered into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business and had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately $3.9 million of capital assets as of August 31, 2024. In addition, we are involved in three limited partnership agreements to contribute a maximum of $30.0 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector. As of August 31, 2024, we have contributed approximately $23.6 million of the total funding commitment.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and fiduciaries of certain of our retirement plans, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.</p>
<p>We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health and medical benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of August 31, 2024. We also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retention through our captive insurance company.</p>
<h2>Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities</h2>
<p>Primary sources of cash, restricted cash, and equivalents are through collections for services rendered to our customers and interest earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Primary uses of cash include employee compensation and contractual obligations related to business operations, cash dividends paid, share repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Our investment portfolio incorporates both corporate cash and funds held for clients. Interest rates, market conditions, and our volatile cash flows are among several factors influencing our investment strategy directing the mix between long-term and VRDN AFS securities compared to short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held in the portfolio. A portfolio strategy that favors larger balances held in restricted cash and cash equivalents will impact our investing activities due to the offsetting activity in the purchases and sales or maturities of AFS investments.</p>
<p>Our cash flows include certain activities that are short-term in nature and have an impact on short-term cash flows due to timing of collection and settlement of obligations as follows:</p>
<p>· PEO receivables and worksite-employee ("WSE") accrued compensation: PEO receivables and WSE accrued compensation fluctuate based on either/both: (1) the timing of the payroll cut-off date and the Company's month-end close, and (2) the timing of when cash is collected from the customer, and it is remitted to either the WSE for wages earned or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll taxes. PEO accounts receivable collections and compensation payments to WSEs and applicable tax or regulatory agencies are settled through our corporate cash and the fluctuations impact our operating activities.</p>
<p>· Client fund obligations: Client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of when cash is collected from the clients and when it is remitted to employees of the clients utilizing employee payment services or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. Fluctuations in client fund obligations impact financing activities.</p>

<h2>MARKET RISK FACTORS</h2>
<p>Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and AFS securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of AFS securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our long-term AFS securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominantly in corporate bonds; municipal bonds; U.S. government agency securities; and VRDNs when available in the market. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the AFS securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.</p>
<p>During the first quarter, our primary short-term investment vehicles were U.S. government agency discount notes and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. We have insignificant exposure to European investments. We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.</p>
<p>During the first quarter, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios was 3.9% compared to 3.7% for the prior year period. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, earnings will decrease from our short-term investments, and over time, decrease from our longer-term AFS securities. Earnings from AFS securities, which as of August 31, 2024 had an average duration of 2.6 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates.</p>

<p>VRDNs, when held by us, are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.</p>
<p>As of August 31, 2024, the Federal Funds rate was in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Effective September 19, 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased the Federal Funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%. There continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies related to the overall macroeconomic environment. We will continue to monitor the market and economic conditions.</p>
<p>Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>·governmental action to address inflation and/or intervene to support financial markets;</li>
<li>·daily interest rate changes;</li>
<li>·seasonal variations in investment balances;</li>
<li>·actual duration of short-term and AFS securities;</li>
<li>·the proportion of taxable and tax-exempt investments;</li>
<li>·changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and</li>
<li>·financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 19 basis points. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to earnings from a 25-basis-point change in short-term interest rates would be approximately $5.0 million to $5.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.</p>
<p>Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments) is expected to average approximately $6.2 billion for the year ending May 31, 2025. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 45% invested in short-term securities and VRDNs with an average duration of less than 30 days and 55% invested in AFS securities, with an average duration of two and one-half to three and three-quarters years.</p>
<p>The combined funds held for clients and corporate AFS securities reflected net unrealized losses of $80.4 million as of August 31, 2024 and $162.5 million as of May 31, 2024. During the first quarter, the net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios ranged from a loss of $162.5 million to a loss of $75.8 million. These fluctuations were driven by changes in market rates of interest. The net unrealized loss on our investment portfolio was approximately $49.3 million as of September 27, 2024.</p>
<p>As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, we had $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, invested in AFS securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-tomaturity was 3.1% as of August 31, 2024 and 3.0 % as of May 31, 2024. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes AFS securities tied to short-term interest rates, such as VRDNs, when held. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of AFS securities as of August 31, 2024, would be in a range of approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on our results of operations unless any declines in fair value are due to credit related concerns and an impairment loss is recognized.</p>

<p>We are also exposed to interest rate risk through the use of our credit facilities as outlined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Form 10-Q. If interest rates were to increase, or we increase the frequency or amounts borrowed under these credit facilities, we could experience additional interest expense and a corresponding decrease in earnings.</p>
<p>Credit risk: We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our investments in AFS securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns and we believe that the investments we held as of August 31, 2024 were not impaired as a result of the previously discussed reasons. While $2.0 billion of our AFS securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the gross unrealized losses of $98.0 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. A substantial portion of the AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 had an AA rating or better. We do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an investment is not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments, including changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.</p>
<p>We have some credit risk exposure relating to our purchase of client accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements. There is also credit risk exposure relating to our trade accounts receivable. This credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential write-off. No single client was material in respect to total accounts receivable, service revenue, or results of operations as of August 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Market risk: We have an ongoing monitoring system for financial institutions we conduct business with and maintain cash balances at large well-capitalized (as defined by their regulators) financial institutions. We closely monitor market conditions and take appropriate measures, when necessary, to minimize potential risk exposure to our client's and our cash and investment balances.</p>
