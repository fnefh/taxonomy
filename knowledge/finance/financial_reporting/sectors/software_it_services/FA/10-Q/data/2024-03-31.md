<h2>First Advantage Corporation</h2>
<h2>Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<h2>Note 1. Organization, Nature of Business, and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>First Advantage Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was formed on November 15, 2019. Hereafter, First Advantage Corporation and its subsidiaries will collectively be referred to as the "Company."</p>
<p>The Company derives its revenues from a variety of background check and compliance services performed across all phases of the workforce lifecycle from preonboarding services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our service offerings into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products.</p>
<p>Pre-onboarding services are comprised of an extensive array of products and solutions that customers typically utilize to enhance their evaluation process and support compliance from the time a job or other application is submitted to a successful applicant's onboarding date. This includes searches such as criminal background checks, drug / health screenings, extended workforce screening, biometrics and identity checks, education / workforce verification, driver records and compliance, healthcare credentials, and executive screening.</p>
<p>Post-onboarding services are comprised of continuous monitoring and re-screening solutions, which are important tools to help keep their end customers, workforces, and other stakeholders safer, more productive, and more compliant. Our post-monitoring solutions include criminal records, healthcare sanctions, motor vehicle records, social media, and global sanctions screening continuously or at regular intervals selected by our customers.</p>
<p>Adjacent products include products that complement our pre-onboarding and post-onboarding products and solutions. This includes fleet / vehicle compliance, hiring tax credits and incentives, resident / tenant screening, employment eligibility, and investigative research.</p>
<p>Basis of Presentation -The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company includes the results of operations of acquired companies prospectively from the date of acquisition.</p>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to summarize fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The interim results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be taken as indicative of results that may be expected for future interim periods or the full year. For a more comprehensive understanding of the Company and its condensed consolidated financial statements, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The Company has historically experienced seasonality with respect to certain customer industries as a result of fluctuations in hiring volumes and other economic activities. Generally, the Company's highest revenues have historically occurred between October and November of each year, driven by many customers' pre-holiday season hiring initiatives.</p>
<p>Use of Estimates - The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.</p>
<p>Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions, include, but are not limited to, the determination of the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations, goodwill impairment, revenue recognition, capitalized software, assumptions used for purposes of determining share-based compensation, and income tax liabilities and assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.</p>
<h2>Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Certain financial assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, Fair Value Measurement . ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The valuation techniques required by ASC 820 are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:</p>
<p>Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.</p>
<p>Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.</p>
<p>Level 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable (supported by little or no market activities). These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that reflect the Company's best estimate of fair value from a market participant.</p>
<p>The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.</p>
<p>The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments (Level 1). The fair values and carrying values of the Company's long-term debt are disclosed in Note 6.</p>
<p>The following table presents information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their assigned levels within the valuation hierarchy as of March 31, 2024 (in thousands):</p>

<p>Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis</p>
<p>Other intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement as the result of business acquisitions. The fair values of these assets were estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows through unobservable inputs (Level 3).</p>
<p>Business Combinations - The Company records business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . Under the acquisition method of accounting, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Changes in the estimated fair values of net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will adjust the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are reflected in the period in which they occur.</p>
<p>In valuing the trade names, customer lists, and software developed for internal use, the Company utilizes variations of the income approach, which relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. The Company considers the income approach the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. Projected financial information is subject to risk if estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to projected revenues and profitability. If the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations are not met, then the asset could be impaired.</p>
<p>Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with major financial institutions and, at times, such balances with each financial institution may be in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced, and does not anticipate, any losses with respect to its cash deposits. Accounts receivable represent credit granted to customers for services provided. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company had one customer which represented approximately 11% of its consolidated revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company did not have any customers which represented 10% or more of its consolidated revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company did not have any customers which represented 10% or more of its consolidated accounts receivable, net for any period presented.</p>
<p>The Company has entered into interest rate derivative agreements with a counterparty bank to reduce its exposure to interest rate volatility. The Company has determined the counterparty bank to be a high credit quality institution. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency - The functional currency of all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. The translation of the applicable foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenues and expense accounts using average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are accumulated net of tax in a separate component of equity. Currency translation (loss) income included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was approximately $(1.8) million and $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, except for those relating to intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, which are captured in a separate component of equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction (loss) income included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income was approximately $0.0 million and $(0.5) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Recent Accounting Pronouncements - There were no accounting pronouncements issued during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that are expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Note 3. Acquisitions</h2>
<h2>Pending Acquisition of Sterling Check Corp.</h2>
<p>On February 28, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among First Advantage, Sterling Check Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Sterling"), and Starter Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Sterling, with Sterling continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger and becoming an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage. The cash-and-stock transaction (the "Acquisition") valued Sterling at approximately $2.2 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.</p>
<p>The Acquisition is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by Sterling stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") and clearance under the antitrust and foreign direct investment laws of certain other jurisdictions, and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by First Advantage in connection with the Acquisition.</p>
<h2>2023 Acquisition</h2>
<p>On September 1, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest of a digital identity and biometrics solutions company headquartered in New York, for $41.0 million. The acquired company operates under the trade name Infinite ID. The acquisition expands the Company's network and portfolio of identity solutions in the United States. The acquired company was determined to constitute a business and the Company was deemed to be the acquirer under ASC 805. As a result, the Company has recorded the related purchase accounting as of September 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The allocation of the purchase price is based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the consideration paid and the amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):</p>

<p>Goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Results of operations have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company's Americas segment since the date of acquisition. The acquisition is not material to the Company's financial position as of March 31, 2024 or results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and therefore, pro forma operating results and other disclosures for the acquisitions are not presented.</p>
<p>As of the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued, the purchase accounting related to this acquisition was incomplete as the valuation of deferred taxes and certain customary transaction adjustments were not yet finalized. The Company has reflected the provisional amounts in these condensed consolidated financial statements. As such, the above balances may be adjusted in a future period as the valuation is finalized and these adjustments may be material to the condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>The Company is a party to a First Lien Credit Agreement (as amended, "Credit Agreement"), which provides for a term loan of $766.6 million due January 31, 2027, carrying an interest rate of 2.75% to 3.00%, based on the first lien ratio, plus LIBOR ("First Lien Credit Facility") and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility due July 31, 2026 ("Revolver"). Pursuant to an amendment in June 2023, the reference rate under the Credit Agreement was transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), with the addition of an applicable margin. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets and capital stock owned by direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and are governed by certain restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness, liens, and other corporate actions such as investments and acquisitions. In the event the Company's outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver exceeds 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the revolving commitments then in effect, it is required to maintain a consolidated first lien leverage ratio no greater than 7.75 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and $564.7 million outstanding under the First Lien Credit Facility. As the Company had no outstanding amounts under the Revolver, it was not subject to the consolidated first lien leverage ratio covenant. The Company was compliant with all other covenants under the agreement as of March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on February 28, 2024, First Advantage Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (the "Borrower"), entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.820 billion and incremental revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $150 million, in each case, under the Credit Agreement. Such financial institutions also agreed to extend the maturity date of the Revolver from July 31, 2026 to the date that is the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition.</p>
<h2>Note 7. Derivatives</h2>
<p>To reduce exposure to variability in expected future cash outflows on variable rate debt attributable to the changes in one-month LIBOR, the Company has historically entered into interest rate derivative instruments to economically offset a portion of this risk and may do so in the future. In June 2023, the Company transitioned the reference rate for its interest rate derivative agreements from one-month LIBOR to one-month SOFR.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company had the following outstanding derivatives that were not designated as a hedge in qualifying hedging relationships:</p>

<h2>Note 8. Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company's income tax expense and balance sheet accounts reflect the results of the Company and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company estimated the annual effective tax rate based on projected income for the full year and recorded a quarterly tax provision in accordance with the annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete tax items in the period.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 32.3%. The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to nondeductible share-based compensation and U.S. state income taxes.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 26.1%. The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the GILTI inclusion, nondeductible share-based compensation, and U.S. state income taxes.</p>
<h2>Note 9. Revenues</h2>
<p>Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized at a point in time when the orders are completed and the completed reports are reported, or otherwise made available. For revenues delivered over time, the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised, with no rights of return once consumed. In these cases, revenues on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenues being recognized when the service is provided and becomes billable. Additionally, under this practical expedient, the Company is not required to estimate the transaction price.</p>
<p>The Company considers negotiated and anticipated incentives and estimated adjustments, including historical collections experience, when recording revenues.</p>
<p>The Company's contracts with customers generally include standard commercial payment terms acceptable in each region, and do not include any financing components. The Company does not have any significant obligations for refunds, warranties, or similar obligations. The Company records revenues net of sales taxes.</p>
<p>Contract balances are generated when the revenues recognized in a given period varies from billing. A contract asset is created when the Company performs a service for a customer and recognizes more revenues than what has been billed. The contract asset balance was $6.7 million and $4.8 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>A contract liability is created when the Company transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed. The Company recognizes these contract liabilities as deferred revenues when the Company has an obligation to perform services for a customer in the future and has already received consideration from the customer. The contract liability balance was $2.0 million and $1.9 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in deferred revenues in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. An immaterial amount of revenues was recognized in the current period related to the beginning balance of deferred revenues.</p>

<h2>2021 Equity Plan</h2>
<p>The 2021 Equity Plan is intended to provide a means through which to attract and retain key personnel and to provide a means whereby our directors, officers, employees, consultants, and advisors can acquire and maintain an equity interest in us, or be paid incentive compensation, including incentive compensation measured by reference to the value of our common stock, thereby strengthening their commitment to our welfare and aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. The 2021 Equity Plan provides for the grant of awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and other equity-based or cashbased awards as determined by the Company's Compensation Committee.

<p>As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $36.4 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, comprised of approximately $12.1 million related to restricted stock, $8.1 million related to RSUs, and approximately $16.2 million related to stock options, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.</p>
<h2>2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan</h2>
<p>The Company adopted the ESPP, which allows eligible employees to voluntarily make after-tax contributions of up to 15% of such employee's cash compensation to acquire Company stock during designated offering periods. Each offering period consists of one six-month purchase period. During the holding period, ESPP purchased shares are not eligible for sale or broker transfer. The Company recorded an associated expense of approximately $0.2 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.</p>
<h2>Note 11. Equity</h2>
<h2>Preferred Stock</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 250,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock were authorized, and no Preferred Stock was issued or outstanding.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the remaining authorized value of shares available to be repurchased under the Repurchase Program was approximately $80.5 million. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company will be suspending purchases under its Repurchase Program.</p>
<h2>Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations as compared to December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. At times, the Company, given the nature of its background screening business, could become subject to lawsuits, or potential class action lawsuits, in multiple jurisdictions, related to claims brought primarily by consumers or individuals who were the subject of its screening services.</p>
<p>For all pending matters, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend vigorously or otherwise seek indemnification from other parties as appropriate. However, the Company has recorded a liability of $4.7 million and $5.2 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for matters that it believes a loss is both probable and estimable. This is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.</p>
<h2>Note 13. Related Party Transactions</h2>
<p>The Company had no material related party transactions for the three months ended March 31, 2024.</p>
<h2>Note 14. Net (Loss) Income Per Share</h2>
<p>Basic weighted-average shares outstanding excludes nonvested restricted stock. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding is similar to basic weighted-average shares outstanding, except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common share had been issued, including the dilutive impact of nonvested restricted stock. The potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2024, had an anti-dilutive effect and were therefore not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share. Basic and diluted net (loss) income per share was calculated as follows:</p>

<h2>Note 15. Reportable Segments</h2>
<p>We have two reportable segments, Americas and International. Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses the profit measure of Adjusted EBITDA, on both a consolidated and a segment basis, to allocate resources and assess performance of our businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our profit measure because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of operating performance, which is useful to compare operating results between periods. Our CODM also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure for both segment and corporate management under our incentive compensation plans. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours.</p>
<p>We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and as further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition-related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges. We exclude the impact of share-based compensation because it is a non-cash expense and we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash generation potential. We exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other charges because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>The segment financial information below aligns with how we report information to our CODM to assess operating performance and how the Company manages the business. Corporate costs are generally allocated to the segments based upon estimated revenue levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable. The CODM does not review the Company's assets by segment; therefore, such information is not presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 9, "Revenues."</p>
<p>The following is a description of our two reportable segments:</p>
<p>Americas. This segment performs a variety of background check and compliance services across all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our service offerings into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products. We deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the United States, Canada, and Latin America markets.</p>
<p>International. The International segment provides services similar to our Americas segment in regions outside of the Americas. We primarily deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the Europe, India, and Asia Pacific markets.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>First Advantage is a leading provider of employment background screening, identity, and verification solutions. We deliver innovative services and insights that help our customers manage risk and hire the best talent. Enabled by our proprietary technology, we help companies protect their brands and provide safer environments for their customers and their most important resources: employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive product suite includes criminal background checks, drug / health screening, extended workforce screening, biometrics and identity, education / work verifications, resident screening, fleet / driver compliance, executive screening, data analytics, continuous monitoring, social media monitoring, and hiring tax incentives. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from pre-onboarding screening and perform screens in over 200 countries and territories, enabling us to serve as a onestop-shop provider to both multinational companies and growth companies. Our more than 30,000 customers are global enterprises, mid-sized companies, and small companies, and our products and solutions are used by personnel in recruiting, human resources, risk, compliance, vendor management, safety, and/or security.</p>
<p>Our products are sold both individually and packaged. The First Advantage platform offers flexibility for customers to specify which products to include in their screening package, such as Social Security numbers, criminal records, education and work verifications, sex offender registry, and global sanctions. Generally, our customers order a background screening package or selected combination of screens related to a single individual before they onboard that individual. The type and mix of products and solutions we sell to a customer vary by customer size, their screening requirements, and industry vertical. Therefore, order volumes are not comparable across both customers and periods. Pricing can also vary considerably by customer depending on the product mix in their screening packages, order volumes, screening requirements and preferences, pass-through and third-party out of pocket costs, and bundling of products.</p>
<p>We enter into contracts with our customers that are typically three years in length. These contracts set forth the general terms and pricing of our products and solutions but generally do not include minimum order volumes or committed order volumes. Accordingly, contracts do not provide guarantees of future revenues. Due to our contract terms and the nature of the background screening industry, we determined our contract terms for ASC 606 purposes are less than one year. We typically bill our customers at the end of each month and recognize revenues as completed orders are reported or otherwise made available to our customers. Approximately 90% of our criminal searches performed in the United States in 2023 were completed the same day they were submitted.</p>
<p>We generated revenues of $169.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which represents a decline of 3.5% as compared to $175.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Approximately 87% of our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was generated in the Americas, predominantly in the United States, while the remaining 13% was generated internationally. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Please refer to "Results of Operations" for further details.</p>
<h2>Segments</h2>
<p>We manage our business and report our financial results in two reportable segments, Americas and International:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Americas. This segment performs a variety of background check and compliance services across all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our service offerings into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products. We deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the United States, Canada, and Latin America markets.</li>
<li>· International. The International segment provides services similar to our Americas segment in regions outside of the Americas. We primarily deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the Europe, India, and Asia Pacific markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>We experience seasonality with respect to certain industries due to fluctuations in hiring volumes and other economic activity. For example, pre-onboarding revenues generated from our customers in the retail and transportation industries are historically highest during the months of October and November, leading up to the U.S. holiday season and lowest in December and at the beginning of the new year, following the U.S. holiday hiring season. Certain customers across various industries also historically increase their hiring throughout the second quarter of the year as winter concludes, commercial activity tied to outdoor activities increases, and the school year ends, giving rise to student and graduate hiring. We expect that further growth in e-commerce, the continued digital transformation of the economy, and other economic forces may impact future seasonality, but we are unable to predict these potential shifts and how our business may be impacted.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h2>Pending Acquisition of Sterling Check Corp.</h2>
<p>On February 28, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among First Advantage, Sterling Check Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Sterling"), and Starter Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Sterling, with Sterling continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger and becoming an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage. The cash-and-stock transaction (the "Acquisition") valued Sterling at approximately $2.2 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.</p>
<p>The Acquisition is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by Sterling stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") and clearance under the antitrust and foreign direct investment laws of certain other jurisdictions, and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 filed by First Advantage in connection with the Acquisition.</p>
<p>In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Borrower, entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.820 billion and incremental revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $150 million, in each case, under the Borrower's existing credit agreement. Such financial institutions also agreed to extend the maturity date of the Borrower's revolving credit facility from July 31, 2026 to the date that is the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition.</p>
<h2>Current Economic Conditions</h2>
<p>Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rates, recent declines in hiring activity and job openings, stability of the global banking system, global health crises, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have negatively impacted significant portions of the global economy, and created volatility in the financial markets.</p>
<p>If the economic uncertainty is sustained or increases, we may experience a negative impact on new business, customer renewals and demand levels, sales and marketing efforts, revenues growth rates, customer deployments, customer collections, product development, or other financial metrics. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.</p>
<p>Despite the continuing uncertainty associated with these events, we are confident in the overall long-term health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy and help our customers hire smarter and onboard faster. Our ability to deliver innovative products and solutions that enhance workplace safety and address compliance risks has contributed to the durability of our financial results. For additional information, see our "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Components of our Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>Revenues</h2>
<p>The Company derives revenues from a variety of background screening and adjacent products that cover all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding screening services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our products and solutions into three major categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products, each of which is enabled by our technology, proprietary internal databases, and data analytics capabilities. Pre-onboarding products, which comprise the substantial majority of our revenues, span an extensive array of products that customers typically utilize to enhance their applicant evaluation process and help ensure compliance with their workforce onboarding criteria from the time an application is submitted to an applicant's successful onboarding. Post-onboarding products are comprised of continuous monitoring, re-screening, and other solutions to help our customers keep their end customers, workforces, and other stakeholders safer, more productive, and more compliant. Adjacent products include products that complement our pre-onboarding and post-onboarding solutions such as fleet / vehicle compliance, hiring tax credits and incentives, resident / tenant screening, employment eligibility, and investigative research.</p>
<p>Our suite of products is available individually or through packaged solutions that can be configured and tailored according to our customers' needs. We typically bill our customers at the end of each month and recognize revenues after completed orders are reported or otherwise made available to our customers, with a substantial majority of our customers' orders completed the same day they are submitted. We recognize revenues for other products over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the products and solutions delivered.</p>
<h2>Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>We incur the following expenses related to our cost of revenues and operating expenses:</p>
<p>· Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization below) : Consists of amounts paid to third parties for access to government records, other third-party data and services, and our internal processing fulfillment and customer care functions. In addition, cost of services includes expenses from our drug screening lab and collection site network as well as our court runner network. Third-party cost of services are largely variable in nature and are typically invoiced to our customers as direct pass-through costs. Cost of services also includes our salaries and benefits expense for personnel involved in the processing and fulfillment of our screening products and solutions, as well as our customer care organization and robotics process automation implementation team. Other costs included in cost of services relate to allocations of certain overhead costs for our revenue-generating products and solutions, primarily consisting of certain facility costs and administrative services allocated by headcount or another related metric. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to cost of services.</p>
<p>· Product and Technology Expense : Consists of salaries and benefits of personnel involved in the maintenance of our technology and its integrations and APIs, product marketing, management of our network and infrastructure capabilities, and maintenance of our information security and business continuity functions. A portion of the personnel costs are related to the development of new products and features that are primarily developed through agile methodologies. These costs are partially capitalized, and therefore, are partially reflected as amortization expense within the depreciation and amortization cost line item. Product and technology expense also includes third-party costs related to our cloud computing services, software licensing and maintenance, telecommunications, and other data processing functions. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to product and technology expense.</p>
<p>· Selling, General, and Administrative Expense : Consists of sales, customer success, marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Sales, customer success, and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, share-based compensation, and other employee benefits for our verticalized sales and customer success teams. General and administrative expenses include travel expenses and various corporate functions including finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative roles, in addition to certain professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with our IPO and our pending acquisition of Sterling. We expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in the short-term, primarily as a result of additional public company related reporting and compliance costs. Over the long-term, we expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage our past investments. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to selling, general, and administrative expenses.</p>
<p>We have a flexible cost structure that allows our business to adjust quickly to the impacts of macroeconomic events and scale to meet the needs of large new customers. Operating expenses are influenced by the amount of revenues, customer mix, and product mix that contribute to our revenues for any given period. As revenues grow, we would generally expect cost of services to grow in a similar fashion, albeit influenced by the effects of automation, productivity, and other efficiency initiatives as well as customer and product mix shifts and third-party pass-through costs. We regularly review expenses and investments in the context of revenues growth and any shifts we identify in the business in order to align with our overall financial objectives. While we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars to support our continued growth, we believe that, in the long term, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decline gradually in the future as our business grows and our operating efficiency and automation initiatives continue to advance.</p>
<h2>Other Expense, Net</h2>
<p>Our other expense, net consists of interest expense, net. Interest expense, net relates primarily to our debt service costs, the interest-related unrealized gains and losses of our interest rate derivative instruments and, to a lesser extent, the interest on our capital lease obligations and the amortization of deferred financing costs. Additionally, interest expense, net includes interest income earnings on our cash and cash equivalent balances held in interest-bearing accounts. We also earn interest income on our short-term investments which are fixed-time deposits having a maturity date within twelve months.</p>
<h2>Provision for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>Provision for income taxes consists of domestic and foreign corporate income taxes related to earnings from our sale of services, with statutory tax rates that differ by jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may be affected by many other factors including changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, shifts in the allocation of income earned throughout the world, and changes in overall levels of income before tax.</p>

<p>Revenues were $169.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $175.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $6.1 million, or 3.5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a net decrease of $17.8 million, or 10.2%, in existing customer revenues, primarily driven by reduced demand from our customers more impacted by the macroeconomic events, primarily in the International segment, and the impact of lost accounts. These consolidated decreases were partially offset by ongoing strength in upselling and cross-selling to existing customers, contributing $7.7 million, or 4.4%, of additional revenues, and increased revenues from certain existing customers that were impacted by macroeconomic conditions, to a lesser extent, as compared to other existing customers.</p>
<p>The decrease in existing customer revenues was offset by:</p>
<p>·revenues of $8.9 million, or 5.1%, from new customers, primarily attributable to our Americas segment; and</p>
<p>·revenues of $2.8 million, or 1.6%, attributable to the Infinite ID acquisition in the Americas segment.</p>

<p>The decrease in cost of services was primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>·a $2.3 million decrease in variable third-party data expenses as a result of decreased revenue volumes, variation in customer ordering mix, and increased automation; and</li>
<li>·a $1.2 million decrease in personnel expenses in our operations and customer care functions as a result of cost savings actions taken by the Company, as well as productivity efficiencies from the implementation of additional automation programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost of services as a percentage of revenues was 51.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 51.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cost of services percentage of revenues for the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by cost savings from the Company's continued implementation of automation and other process efficiencies, as well as certain cost savings actions taken by the Company. These decreases were partially offset by slight increases in certain third-party data costs, primarily due to variation in customer ordering mix.</p>

<h2>Key Operating and Financial Metrics</h2>
<p>In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe certain measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on longterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone.</p>
<p>The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin</h2>
<p>Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a strong indicator of our overall operating performance and is useful to management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and as further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition-related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges. We exclude the impact of share-based compensation because it is a non-cash expense and we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash generation potential. We exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other charges because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA was $46.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 27.5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 27.7%. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $2.0 million, or 4.1%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA declined during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as macroeconomic events impacted our revenues attributed to existing customers. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from certain existing and new customers, including ongoing strength in upselling and cross-selling, cost structure benefits due to increased automation, operational efficiencies, and certain other cost savings actions taken by the Company.</p>

<h2>Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share</h2>
<p>Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are strong indicators of our overall operating performance and are useful to our management and investors as measures of comparative operating performance from period to period. We define Adjusted Net Income for a particular period as net (loss) income before taxes adjusted for debt-related costs, acquisition-related depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges, to which we then apply the related effective tax rate. We define Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average number of shares outstanding-diluted.</p>
<p>Adjusted Net Income was $24.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $28.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $3.6 million, or 12.6% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share was $0.17 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.19 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $0.02, or 10.5% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share declined during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as reduced demand from customers more impacted by macroeconomic events contributed to lower revenues and profitability. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were further impacted by changes in acquisition-related depreciation and amortization and changes in our capital structure that are captured in interest expense. Gains or losses and actual cash payments and receipts on the Company's interest rate swaps impact the comparability of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share across historical periods. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is further impacted by shares repurchased under the Company's Repurchase Program.</p>

<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>The Company's primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, continued investments in software development and other capital expenditures, and other strategic investments, including the Acquisition. In 2023, the Company fully utilized its remaining U.S. Federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, income taxes will become a material use of funds, depending on our future profitability, and future tax rates. The Company's liquidity needs are met primarily through existing balance sheet cash, cash flows from operations, as well as funds available under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our term loan borrowings, including incremental term loan borrowings expected to be incurred to fund the Acquisition pursuant to a commitment letter entered into with certain financial institutions. Our cash flows from operations include cash received from customers, less cash costs to provide services to our customers, which includes general and administrative costs and interest payments.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2024, we had $245.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $100.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2024, we had $564.7 million of total debt outstanding. We believe our cash on hand, together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are and will continue to be adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds. In the event that we need access to additional cash, we may not be able to access the credit markets on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures and our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors that may be beyond our control, including those described under our "Risk Factors" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>On August 2, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of the Company's common stock over the 12-month period ending August 2, 2023 (the "Repurchase Program"). Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases at prevailing market prices, including through the use of block trades and trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately-negotiated transactions, through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, or a combination of these methods on such terms and in such amounts as the Company deems appropriate and will be funded from available capital. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing, manner, value, and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's stock price and liquidity requirements, other business considerations and general market and economic conditions. No shares will be purchased from SLP Fastball Aggregator, L.P. and its affiliates. The Company may discontinue or modify purchases without notice at any time. The Company has used and plans to use its existing cash to fund repurchases made under the share repurchase program.</p>
<p>On November 8, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the total available amount under its Repurchase Program to $150.0 million and extended the program through December 31, 2023. On February 28, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the total available amount under its Repurchase Program to $200.0 million. On September 14, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a one-year extension of its share repurchase authorization, extending the previously authorized $200.0 million program through December 31, 2024. Through May 3, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately $119.5 million of shares under the Repurchase Program. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company suspended purchases under its Repurchase Program.</p>
<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>On August 8, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a one-time special cash dividend of $1.50 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 21, 2023. An aggregate cash dividend of $217.7 million was paid on August 31, 2023 with cash from the balance sheet.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Debt</h2>
<p>In February 2020, a new financing structure was established, which included a new First Lien Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provided financing in the form of a $670.0 million term loan due January 31, 2027 ("First Lien Credit Facility") and a $75.0 million new revolving credit facility due January 31, 2025 ("Revolver").</p>
<p>On February 1, 2021, we amended the First Lien Agreement to fund $100.0 million of additional first lien term loans and reduce the applicable margins by 0.25%.</p>
<p>In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into an amendment to increase the borrowing capacity under the Revolver from $75.0 million to $100.0 million and extend the maturity date from January 31, 2025 to July 31, 2026.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the First Lien Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate or (b) LIBOR, which is subject to a floor of 0.00% per annum. Pursuant to an amendment in June 2023, the reference rate under the Credit Agreement was transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), with the addition of an applicable margin. The applicable margins under the First Lien Agreement are subject to stepdowns based on our first lien net leverage ratio. In connection with the closing of the IPO, each applicable margin was reduced further by 0.25%. In addition, the borrower, First Advantage Holdings, LLC, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is required to pay a commitment fee on any unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility. The commitment fee rate ranges between 0.25% and 0.50% per annum based on our first lien net leverage ratio. The borrower is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.</p>
<p>The First Lien Credit Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the principal amount. The Revolver has no amortization. The First Lien Credit Facility requires the borrower to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with certain proceeds from nonordinary course asset sales, issuance of debt not permitted by the credit agreement to be incurred and annual excess cash flows. In addition, any voluntary prepayment of term loans in connection with certain repricing transactions on or prior to August 1, 2021 were subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium. Otherwise, the borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans without premium or penalty, other than customary "breakage" costs.</p>
<p>In connection with the closing of the IPO, on June 30, 2021, the Company repaid $200.0 million of the First Lien Credit Facility outstanding, of which $44.3 million was applied to all of the remaining quarterly amortizing principal payments due under the First Lien Agreement. The remaining $564.7 million term loan is scheduled to mature on January 31, 2027.</p>
<p>The First Lien Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by Fastball Parent, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the direct parent of the borrower, and material wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of Fastball Parent, Inc. The First Lien Agreement and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by (1) a first priority security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the guarantors and (2) a firstpriority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the borrower and of each wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary of the borrower and the guarantors (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, does not include more than 65% of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary).</p>
<p>The First Lien Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, and events of default (including upon a change of control). The First Lien Agreement also includes a "springing" first lien net leverage ratio test, applicable only to the Revolver, that requires such ratio to be no greater than 7.75:1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter if more than 35.0% of the Revolver is utilized on such date.</p>

<h2>Cash Flows from Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash provided by operating activities was $38.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $38.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $0.3 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities were impacted by the continuation of more modest hiring activity from our customers resulting from the ongoing uncertainty from the macroeconomic environment. This was offset in part by lower accounts receivable driven by increased cash collections from customers.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in investing activities was $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by $0.9 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Increases in cash flows used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were driven primarily by capitalized software development costs, which increased in 2024 as the Company continued to make incremental investments in its technology platform and increases in short-term investments internationally.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash provided by (used) in financing activities was $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $(24.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was driven by cash inflows related to share-based compensation activity. These inflows were offset by cash outflows related to payments on the deferred purchase of a software platform. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was impacted by shares repurchased under the Company's Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, 1,871,691 shares were repurchased under the program at a total cost of $25.3 million.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term "disclosure controls and procedures" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosures.</p>
<p>Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Based on the evaluation of management's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
