## Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise stated)

(Unaudited)

## Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity ("ADP" or the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company's management, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's interim financial results.

The Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees. The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust. The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, "Consolidation" to be characterized as a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and, therefore, consolidates the trust. Further information on these funds and the Company's obligations to remit to its clients' employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 6, "Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients."

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 ("fiscal 2023").

Certain amounts from the prior year's financial statements have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We also updated the description of "Systems development and programming costs" to "Research and development" within the Statement of Consolidated Earnings, this change did not result in changes to current or previously reported amounts.

## Note 3. Revenue

Based upon similar operational and economic characteristics, the Company's revenues are disaggregated by itsthree business pillars: Human Capital Management ("HCM"), HR Outsourcing ("HRO"), and Global Solutions ("Global"), with separate disaggregation for PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through revenues and client funds interest revenues. The Company believes these revenue categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

The following tables provide details of revenue by our business pillars, and include a reconciliation to the Company's reportable segments:

| Total Segment Revenues | $ 9,021.3 | $ 4,524.7 | $ (11.6) | $ 13,534.4 |

## Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition for HCM, HRO and Global Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients, as invoicing occurs in the period the services are provided. Therefore, the Company does not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing.

Changes in deferred revenues related to set up fees for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 were as follows:

| | Contract Liability |
| --- | --- |
| Contract liability, July 1, 2023 | $ 464.8 |
| Recognition of revenue included in beginning of year contract liability | (32.3) |
| Contract liability, net of revenue recognized on contracts during the period | 45.0 |
| Currency translation adjustments | 6.4 |
| Contract liability, March 31, 2024 | $ 483.9 |

## Note 9. Short-term Financing

The Company has a $4.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2024 with aone year term-out option. The Company also has afive year, $3.2 billion credit facility maturing in June 2026 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. In addition, the Company also has a $2.25 billion, five year credit facility that matures in June 2028 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to SOFR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through March 31, 2024 under the credit agreements.

The Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. The Company's commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor's, Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody's and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Average daily borrowings (in billions) | $ 2.7 | $ 1.5 | $ 3.6 | $ 3.2 |
| Weighted average interest rates | 5.4 % | 4.5 % | 5.3 % | 3.1 % |
| Weighted average maturity (approximately in days) | 2 days | 1 day | 2 days | 2 days |

The Company's U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. At March 31, 2024, the Company hadno outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2023, the Company had $105.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements.Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:

## Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans

## A. Stock-based Compensation Plans. Stock-based compensation consists of the following:

The Company's share-based compensation consists of stock options, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock, and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan for eligible employees. Beginning in September 2022, the Company discontinued granting stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock. Any such future awards will be grants of time-based restricted stock units and/or performance-based restricted stock units, depending on employee eligibility. Time-based restricted stock unit awards and performancebased restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are settled in stock, and for awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash.

The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company repurchase d 1.2 million shares in each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and repurchased 3.3 million and 3.5 million shares in the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

The following table represents pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Operating expenses | $ 7.8 | $ 6.1 | $ 22.6 | $ 18.5 |
| Selling, general and administrative expenses | 39.2 | 53.3 | 139.6 | 134.9 |
| Research and development | 9.3 | 8.2 | 26.5 | 23.2 |
| Total stock-based compensation expense | $ 56.3 | $ 67.6 | $ 188.7 | $ 176.6 |

## B. Pension Plans

The components of net pension income were as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 | Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | |
| Service cost - benefits earned during the period | $ 1.3 | $ 1.2 | $ 3.9 | $ 3.5 |
| Interest cost on projected benefits | 21.2 | 19.5 | 63.4 | 58.6 |
| Expected return on plan assets | (29.0) | (31.9) | (86.9) | (95.6) |
| Net amortization and deferral | 0.7 | 0.5 | 2.2 | 1.4 |
| Settlement charges and special termination benefits | - | - | - | 1.4 |
| Net pension (income)/expense | $ (5.8) | $ (10.7) | $ (17.4) | $ (30.7) |

## Note 12. Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was23.4% and 23.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an intercompany transfer of certain assets in the three months ended March 31, 2024 offset by an increased benefit for Research and Development Tax Credits in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was22.7% and 23.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions, a lower state income tax rate and a valuation allowance release offset by a lower benefit for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in nine months ended March 31, 2024.

## Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies

In May 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed against ADP, TotalSource and related defendants in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaint asserts violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") in connection with the ADP TotalSource Retirement Savings Plan's fiduciary administrative and investment decision-making. The complaint seeks statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney's fees. The Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter. The Company is vigorously defending against this lawsuit.

The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.

It is not the Company's business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company's services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.

## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") technology solutions to employers around the world. Our HCM solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We continuously seek to enhance our leading HCM solutions to further support our clients. We see tremendous opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: Leading with Best-in-Class HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients. Executing on our Strategic Priorities will be critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.

During the third quarter we continued to make meaningful progress on our strategic priorities. On the technology front, we continued the rollout of ADP Assist, which utilizes generative AI ("GenAI") technology to proactively surface insights that enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making with data-driven insights, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. To lean into our service expertise, we extended GenAI capabilities to a broader portion of our service and implementation associates to deliver an even better client experience. Finally, we continued to leverage our global scale to benefit our clients by requiring all partners offering AI-enabled solutions on ADP Marketplace to commit to a set of responsible AI principles based on the principles that govern our own products.

Highlights from the nine months ended March 31, 2024 include:

- · Revenue growth of 7% to $14,434.1 million; 6% organic constant currency
- · Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 90 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 60 bps
- · Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth of 12%, to $7.07 and $7.08, respectively.
- · Cash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $2.4B, including $1.6B of dividends and $0.8B of share repurchases

For the nine months ended March 31, 2024, we delivered solid revenue growth of 7%, 6% organic constant currency. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 2% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023. PEO average worksite employees increased 2% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023.

We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients' HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our re-investments, longer term strategy, and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at March 31, 2024 and we remain well positioned to support our clients and our associates.

## RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

Margin increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to contributions from client funds interest revenues discussed above, increased interest income on corporate funds, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, partially offset by increased interest expense, increased investments and costs to develop, support and maintain our new and existing products, changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, and increased selling expense.

Margin increased for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, due to contributions from client funds interest revenues discussed above, operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, and a gain on sale of assets, partially offset by increased interest expense, increased selling expense, increased investments and costs to develop, support and maintain our new and existing products, and changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin exclude interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strate gy, legal settlements, and charges related to our broad-based transformation initiatives and the impact of net severance charges, as applicable, in the respective periods.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 23.4% and 23.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an intercompany transfer of certain assets in the three months ended March 31, 2024 offset by an increased benefit for Research and Development Tax Credits in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 22.7% and 23.2%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions, a lower state income tax rate and a valuation allowance release offset by a lower benefit for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in nine months ended March 31, 2024.

## Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes

The adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 23.4% and 23.5%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.

The adjusted effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was 22.7% and 23.2%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.

| Adjusted diluted EPS | $ 2.88 | $ 2.52 | 14 % | $ 7.08 | $ 6.34 | 12 % |

For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, net earnings reflect the changes described above in our earnings before income taxes and our effective tax rate.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, in addition to the increase in net earnings, diluted EPS increased as a result of the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 1.2 million shares during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 1.2 million shares during the three months ended March 31, 2023, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

For the nine months ended March 31, 2024, in addition to the increase in net earnings, diluted EPS increased as a result of the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million shares during the nine months ended March 31, 2024, and 3.5 million shares during the nine months ended March 31, 2023, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

PEO Services' revenue increased for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, due to increases in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, and increases in average worksite employees of 3% and 2%, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023.

## Earnings before Income Taxes

PEO Services' earnings before income taxes decreased 10% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to lower releases of workers compensation reserves in ADP Indemnity of $15.3 million as compared to prior year, and increases in selling expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by increased revenues discussed above.

PEO Services' earnings before income taxes decreased 4% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 due to lower releases of workers compensation reserves in ADP Indemnity of $26.0 million as compared to prior year, and increases in selling expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by increased revenues discussed above.

## Margin

PEO Services' margin decreased for the three months ended due to changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, and increases in zero-margin benefits passthrough costs, partially offset by increased revenues discussed above.

PEO Services' margin decreased for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 due to changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, increases in selling expenses, and increases in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, partially offset by increased revenues discussed above.

ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.

Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a whollyowned subsidiary of Chubb Limited ("Chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. ADP I ndemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $1.6 million and $6.1 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately $16.9 million and $32.1 million for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. In

July 2023, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of$ 269 million t o enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2024 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2023 reinsurance policy.

## Other

The primary components of "Other" are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest income and expense.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:

| Adjusted Financial Measure | U.S. GAAP Measures |
| --- | --- |
| Adjusted EBIT | Net earnings |
| Adjusted provision for income taxes | Provision for income taxes |
| Adjusted net earnings | Net earnings |
| Adjusted diluted earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share |
| Adjusted effective tax rate | Effective tax rate |
| Organic constant currency | Revenues |

We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) In Adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."

The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The

impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our$9.7 b illion of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both lo ng-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Our fi nancial condition remains solid at March 31, 2024 and we have sufficient liquidity.

For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.

## Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are summarized as follows:

| | Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 $ Change | Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 $ Change | Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 $ Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | | |
| Cash provided by / (used in): | | | |
| Operating activities | $ 2,857.0 | $ 3,021.9 | $ (164.9) |
| Investing activities | (1,171.8) | (2,052.8) | 881.0 |
| Financing activities | 9,683.8 | (5,686.2) | 15,370.0 |
| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents | (15.7) | (25.3) | 9.6 |
| Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents | $ 11,353.3 | $ (4,742.4) | $ 16,095.7 |

Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to timing on collections of accounts receivable, offset by an increase in growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments), as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2023.

Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases and proceeds of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $848.6 million.

Net cash flows provided by/used in financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $14,411.9 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, a net increase in cash received from the Internal Revenue Service as of March 31, 2024, to be refunded to our clients, and a decrease in the net payments related to reverse repurchase agreements. These were offset by an increase in dividends paid.

We purchased approximately 3.3 million shares o f our common stock at an average price per share o f $242.02 duri ng the nine months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to purchases of 3.5 million shares at an average price per share of $231.45 during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

## Capital Resources and Client Funds Obligations

We have $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028 and 2030.W e may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing.

Our U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standar d & Poor's, Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody's and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Compan y had no comm ercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Average daily borrowings (in billions) | $ 2.7 | $ 1.5 | $ 3.6 | $ 3.2 |
| Weighted average interest rates | 5.4 % | 4.5 % | 5.3 % | 3.1 % |
| Weighted average maturity (approximately in days) | 2 days | 1 day | 2 days | 2 days |

Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than l iquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligatio ns. At March 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2023, the Company had $105.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Average outstanding balances | $ 634.4 | $ 343.2 | $ 1,482.0 | $ 811.2 |
| Weighted average interest rates | 5.4 % | 4.4 % | 5.4 % | 3.1 % |

We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2024 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2026 and June 2028, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through March 31, 2024 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing, including credit facilities.

Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and equipment lease receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities has performed as expected through March 31, 2024. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.

Capital expenditures for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 were $151.6 million,as c ompared to $142.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2023. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 to be between $200 million and $225 million, as compared to $206.0 million in fiscal 2023.

## QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).

Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.

We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated A1+ by Standard and Poor's, P-1 by Moody's, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.

We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for Corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, and for single A rated securities, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.

Details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows:

| | Three Months Ended March 31, | Three Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, | Nine Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Average investment balances at cost: | | | | |
| Corporate investments | 5,547.1 | $ 3,564.9 | $ 6,837.5 | $ 5,479.9 |
| Funds held for clients | 41,701.7 | 39,174.5 | 35,135.3 | 33,952.0 |
| Total | 47,248.8 | $ 42,739.4 | $ 41,972.8 | $ 39,431.9 |

| Corporate investments | 4.0 % | 2.7 % | 3.1 % | 2.0 % |
| Funds held for clients | 3.1 % | 2.5 % | 2.8 % | 2.3 % |
| Total | 3.2 % | 2.6 % | 2.9 % | 2.2 % |
| Net realized losses on available-for-sale securities | 1.2 | $ 0.9 | $ 5.2 | $ 13.9 |
| | | | March 31, 2024 | June 30, 2023 |
| Net unrealized pre-tax losses on available-for-sale securities | | $ | (1,582.9) | $ (2,206.9) |
| Total available-for-sale securities at fair value | | $ | 31,096.4 | $ 29,764.9 |

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualiz ed interest rate earned on our entire po rtfolio increased from 2.2% for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 to 2.9% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $19 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending March 31, 2025. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $9 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending March 31, 2025.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody's, Standard & Poor's, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.

## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for changes to our accounting policies effective for the fiscal 2024.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The information called for by this item is provided under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" under Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "evaluation"). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Except as noted below, all other items are either inapplicable or would result in negative responses and, therefore, have been omitted.

## Item 1. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

With respect to the disclosure of administrative or judicial proceedings arising under any Federal, State, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or that are primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, the Company has determined that the following threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to its business or financial condition: any proceeding when the potential monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.
