<h2>Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise stated)</p>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>Note 1. Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity ("ADP" or the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company's management, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's interim financial results.</p>
<p>The Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees of those clients, tax authorities, and other payees. The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust. The trust meets the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, "Consolidation" to be characterized as a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all investment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the form of investment returns) and, therefore, consolidates the trust. Further information on these funds and the Company's obligations to remit to its clients' employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 6, "Corporate Investments and Funds Held for Clients."</p>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"). Certain amounts from the prior year's financial statements have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year's presentation.</p>

<h2>Contract Balances</h2>

The difference between total ROU assets and total lease liabilities is primarily attributable to prepayments of our obligations and the recognition of various lease incentives.</p>
<p>The Company has entered into operating lease agreements for facilities and equipment. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of up to approximatelyeleven years.</p>
<p>The components of operating lease expense were as follows:</p>

<p>Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, trademarks and trade names (acquired directly or through acquisitions). All intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 5 years (6 years for software and software licenses,3 years for customer contracts and lists, and 1 year for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $89.0 million and $95.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>

<h2>Note 9. Short-term Financing</h2>
<p>The Company has a $4.55 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2025 with aone year term-out option. The Company also has a $2.25 billion, five year credit facility that matures in June 2028 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. In addition, the Company also has a five year, $3.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2029 that contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to SOFR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate depending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The Company is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no borrowings through September 30, 2024 under the credit agreements.</p>
<p>The Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that ha ve already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.3 billion in aggregate maturity value. T he Company's commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody's and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Ma turities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to364 days. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was repaid in early October 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Company hadno commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:</p>

<p>The Company's U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had $679.1 million and $385.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. All outstanding reverse repurchase obligations matured and were fully paid in early October 2024 and early July 2024, respectively. The Company has $7.3 billion available on a committed basis under the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements.Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:</p>

<h2>Note 10. Debt</h2>
<p>The Company issued four series of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities of7 and 10 years totaling $4.0 billion (collectively the "Notes"). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually.</p>
<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes due in 2034 bearing a fixed interest rate of4.450%. In connection with the senior notes issuance, the Company terminated several derivative contracts in place to hedge exposure in changes in benchmark interest rates for the senior notes issued with an aggregate notional amount totaling $1.0 billion (of which $400.0 million were executed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $600.0 million were executed on the day of issuance). Since these derivative contracts were classified as cash flow hedges, the unamortized loss of $12.5 million was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings over the life of the issued Notes as the interest payments are made.</p>

<h2>Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans</h2>
<h2>A. Stock-based Compensation Plans. Stock-based compensation consists of the following:</h2>
<p>The Company's share-based compensation consists of stock options, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock, and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan for eligible employees. Beginning in September 2022, the Company discontinued granting stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock. Any such future awards will be grants of time-based restricted stock units and/or performance-based restricted stock units, depending on employee eligibility. Time-based restricted stock unit awards and performancebased restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are settled in stock, and for awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash.</p>
<h2>· Restricted Stock.</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. Time-based restricted stock units generally vest ratably over3 years. Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are settled in stock and cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash and cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of share-settled units</p>
<ul>
<li>is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of cash-settled units is recorded over the vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price. Dividend cash equivalents are paid on share-settled units, and dividend cash equivalents are not paid on cash-settled units.</li>
<li>· Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over aone to three year performance period and a subsequent service period of up to 38 months. Under these programs, the Company communicates "target awards" at the beginning of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from 0% to 200% of the "target awards." Awards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.</li>
<li>Performance-based restricted stock units cannot be transferred and are settled in either cash or stock, depending on the employee's home country. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash is recognized over the vesting period initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded during the performance period based on probable and actual performance against targets. In addition, compensation expense is remeasured at each reporting period during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded based on the probable and actual performance against targets. Dividend equivalents are paid on awards under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.</li>
<li>· Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value for the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period. This plan has been deemed noncompensatory and, therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Companyrepur chased 1.4 million and 1.0 million shares in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.</p>

<h2>Note 12. Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was22.6% and 21.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance release in the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies</h2>
<p>In May 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed against ADP, TotalSource and related defendants in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The complaint asserts violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") in connection with the ADP TotalSource Retirement Savings Plan's fiduciary administrative and investment decision-making. The complaint seeks statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney's fees. The Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter. The Company is vigorously defending against this lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the ultimate loss. Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters against us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.</p>
<p>It is not the Company's business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company's services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.</p>

Statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words like "outlook", "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates," "estimates," "we believe," "could," "is designed to" and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements or that could contribute to such difference include: ADP's success in obtaining and retaining clients, and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; the success of our new solutions; our ability to respond successfully to changes in technology, including artificial intelligence; compliance with existing or new legislation or regulations; changes in, or interpretations of, existing legislation or regulations; overall market, political and economic conditions, including interest rate and foreign currency trends and inflation; competitive conditions; our ability to maintain our current credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and profitability; security or cyber breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures; employment and wage levels; availability of skilled associates; the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures; the adequacy, effectiveness and success of our business transformation initiatives and the impact of any uncertainties related to major natural disasters or catastrophic events; and supply-chain disruptions. ADP disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under "Item 1A. - Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.</p>
<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</h2>
<p>In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.</p>
<h2>EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>We are a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") technology solutions to employers around the world. Our HCM solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We continuously seek to enhance our leading HCM solutions to further support our clients. We see tremendous opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: Leading with Best-in-Class HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients. Executing on our Strategic Priorities will be critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.</p>
<p>During the first quarter we continued to make meaningful progress on our strategic priorities. We continuously aim to offer solutions that solve our clients' complex business challenges. As part of this approach, in October 2024, we acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider that specializes in supporting large, global enterprises. Additionally, in September, we introduced ADP Lyric HCM, our flexible, intelligent and human-centric Global HCM platform. This is a unique offering, combining global HR, global payroll, and global service to adapt to a variety of structures and workflows and offer employers a human-centric approach to managing their people. Finally, we continued to invest in generative AI capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients and empower our associates. During the first quarter, we expanded access to our robust generative AI-based service tools which are designed to bring speed to our service interactions and improve the client experience.</p>
<p>Highlights from the three months ended September 30, 2024 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Revenue growth of 7% to $4,832.7 million; 7% organic constant currency</li>
<li>· Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 140 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 130 bps</li>
<li>· Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth of 13%, to $2.34 and 12%, to $2.33, respectively.</li>
<li>· Cash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $940M, including $570M of dividends and $370M of share repurchases</li>
<li>· Acquired WorkForce Software for approximately $1.2 billion in cash</li>
</ul>
<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered solid revenue growth of 7%, on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. PEO average worksite employees increased 3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients' HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our re-investments, longer term strategy, and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at September 30, 2024 and we remain well positioned to support our clients and our associates.</p>

<p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased due to higher PEO Services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs of $976.7 million to $1,049.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 operating expenses increased by $24.6 million due to higher service and implementation costs in support of our growing revenue.</p>
<p>Research and development expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to efficiencies from workforce optimization efforts initiated in the prior year, and an increase in the capitalizable spend related to the integration of GenAI into our products as compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower amortization of customer contracts and lists, partially offset by amortization of new investments in purchased software and internally developed software primarily for our next-gen products.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in selling and marketing expenses of $31.1 million as a result of investments in our sales organization, and an increase from acquisition and debt issuance related costs.</p>
<p>Interest expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a higher volume of average commercial paper borrowings of $4.8 billion and reverse repurchase borrowings of $3.8 billion, as compared to $4.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Provision for Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.6% and 21.4%, respectively.

<p>PEO Services' earnings before income taxes increased 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in selling expenses, and zero-margin benefits pass-through costs as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Margin</h2>
<p>PEO Services' margin decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increases in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, operating costs related to workers' compensation and less favorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves in ADP Indemnity.</p>
<p>ADP Indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.</p>
<p>Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a whollyowned subsidiary of Chubb Limited ("Chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. ADP I ndemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily a result of less favorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves. In July 2024, ADP In demnity paid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for thefiscal 2025 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2024 reinsurance policy.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>The primary components of "Other" are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest income and expense.</p>
<h2>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h2>
<p>In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:</p>
<table>

<p>We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.</p>

<p>(a) In Adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."</p>
<p>The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.</p>

<h2>FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.</p>
<p>For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our$10.3 billion of co mmitted credit facilities and our ability to access both lo ng-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, ac quisitions and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.O ur financial condition remains solid at September 30, 2024 and we have sufficient liquidity.</p>
<p>For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements ($7.3 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S.), together with our $10.3 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.</p>
<h2>Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows</h2>

<p>Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to favorable changes in the components of working capital and an increase in growth in our business, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases and proceeds of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,426.7 million.</p>
<p>Net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $9,495.6 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, along with a net decrease in cash received from the Internal Revenue Service as of September 30, 2024, to be refunded to our clients, offset by proceeds from commercial paper borrowing and issuance of debt.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions. We purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of o ur common stock at an average price per share o f $259.47 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to purchases of 1.0 million shares at an average price per share of $242.26 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Capital Resources and Client Funds Obligations</h2>
<p>We have $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, 2030 and 2034. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing.</p>
<p>Our U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.3 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standar d &amp; Poor's, Prime-1 ("P-1") by Moody's and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $ 4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was repaid in early October 2024.At J une 30, 2024, the Compan y had no comm ercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:</p>

<p>Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than l iquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligatio ns. We have $7.3 billion available to us on a committed basis under the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had $679.1 million and $385.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements which were fully paid in early October 2024 and early July 2024, respectively. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:</p>

<p>We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.55 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2025 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2028 and June 2029, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through September 30, 2024 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $10.3 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing, including credit facilities.</p>
<p>Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and equipment lease receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities has performed as expected through September 30, 2024. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $55.6 million,as c ompared to $42.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to be between $200 million and $225 million, as compared to $211.7 million in fiscal 2024.</p>
<h2>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<p>Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).</p>
<p>Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.</p>
<p>Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.</p>
<p>We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.</p>
<p>There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $10.3 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor's, P-1 by Moody's, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions ($7.3 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S.) and available borrowings under our $10.3 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.</p>
<p>We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for Corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, and for single A rated securities, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.</p>

<p>We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualiz ed interest rate earned on our entire po rtfolio increased from 2.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related shortterm borrowings would result in approximately a $15 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $7 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025.</p>
<p>We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.</p>
<p>We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.</p>
<h2>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<p>Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for changes to our accounting policies effective for the fiscal 2025.</p>

<p>See Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<p>The information called for by this item is provided under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" under Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "evaluation"). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.</p>
<p>There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II. OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Except as noted below, all other items are either inapplicable or would result in negative responses and, therefore, have been omitted.</p>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.</p>
<p>With respect to the disclosure of administrative or judicial proceedings arising under any Federal, State, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or that are primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, the Company has determined that the following threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to its business or financial condition: any proceeding when the potential monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes in our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.</p>

<p>(1) Securities reported in this column reflect options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based stock units ("PSUs") and shares of common stock, as appropriate. In the case of RSUs, quantities included in this column reflect the full amount of RSUs as reported in an officer's respective plan and do not reflect the impact of tax withholding which will not be determined until the RSUs vest. In the case of PSUs (which have a three-year performance period), quantities included in this column reflect the application of the actual performance factor for tranches where performance has been certified, application at target for tranches where performance is not yet complete, and inclusion of accrued dividend equivalents through the date of adoption of the trading arrangement. The PSU amounts do not reflect the impact of tax withholding which will not be determined until the PSUs vest. In addition, securities reported in this column include securities subject to limit orders and such orders may not fill if limit order conditions are not met.</p>
