# PART I
## Item 1. Business
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "CleanSpark, Inc." and "CleanSpark" mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Dollar amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in thousands, except per share
amounts, bitcoin price, and information set forth under the heading "Bitcoin Mining Operations".

### Overview
CleanSpark is a bitcoin mining company. We independently own and operate a large portfolio of data centers across the United States with locations in Georgia,
Tennessee, Mississippi and Wyoming. As of October 31, 2024, we have with 676 megawatts ("MW") of developed capacity and has 50 MWs of hosted machines in
New York, which supports approximately 31.5 exahash per second ("EH/s") of bitcoin mining computational power. We are currently developing an additional 211.5
MW across the portfolio, which is expected to support approximately 50 EH/s of mining capacity. We do not host miners for any other companies. A partner in
Massena, NY, hosts 1.5 EH/s for us. However, following a non-renewal, the agreement governing such hosting of our miners is scheduled do expire on January 1, 2025
and we plan to move all operational capacity to wholly owned sites to maximize operational efficiency. We design our proprietary data center infrastructure to operate at
high uptime and efficiency in support of bitcoin, the world's most important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion.
Through CleanSpark and our wholly owned subsidiaries, we have operated in the bitcoin mining sector since December 2020.

### Business Activity
Bitcoin mining is our principal revenue generating business activity. As of September 30, 2024, we operated approximately 188,500 bitcoin mining machines, with a
hashrate capacity of approximately 27.6 EH/s and a fleetwide efficiency of 21.94 joules per terahash ("J/TH"). In fiscal year 2024, we mined 7,092 bitcoins, net of
mining pool fees, a 3% increase over the 6,903 bitcoins we mined in fiscal year 2023. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2024 and beyond
as we expand our infrastructure at our portfolio of data centers across the United States with locations in Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Wyoming. We intend to
continue growing our capacity and plan to pursue additional capacity through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin depends on a consensus-based network and a public
ledger called a "blockchain," which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment
network powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or intermediaries, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of
each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over
remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to
confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is broadcast across the network and validated by nodes. Miners then
compete, using a proof-of-work consensus method, to find a target hash value, or output of a cryptographic function, and thereby add a new block and its transactions to
the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, in the form of newly-created bitcoins from the block subsidy and transaction fees
included in that block.
Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important
roles in mining. In bitcoin mining, "hashrate" is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes
transactions on the bitcoin network. A company's hashrate when compared to global hashrate determines its market share and is therefore generally considered one of
the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies.

# Page 6 of 134

We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations by contributing all of our computing power (both owned locations and hosted locations) to one mining pool
operator who is our sole customer. The contract with our mining pool operator is terminable at any time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to
the mining pool, we are entitled to bitcoin rewards from the mining pool operator, which is a variable consideration calculated based on a predetermined formula agreed
to by us and the mining pool operator as a part of the arrangement. The variable consideration is constrained until we can reasonably estimate the amount of mining
rewards by the end of a given day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operator. By then, we consider it a high probability that a
significant reversal in the amount of revenue will not occur and include such variable consideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of
our ordinary activities and the only performance obligation in our contracts with our mining pool operator. We recognize the revenue when the variable consideration is
no longer constrained and the performance obligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. As a result, we do not present disaggregated revenue
information on block rewards and transaction verification fees.
We have historically and may in the future sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. Our decisions to engage in hedging, lending,
borrowing activities, to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically subject to significant volatility.
Decisions to hedge, lend, borrow, hold or sell bitcoins are determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time.
Through our wholly owned subsidiaries CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Properties
Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC, CSRE Properties Mississippi, LLC, CSRE Properties Wyoming, LLC, CSRE
Properties Tennessee, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC, we maintain real property holdings.

**Markets, Geography and Major Customers**

Bitcoin is a global store of value and a medium of exchange used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining bitcoin supports the
global bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining
bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operator a customer because it compensates us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see Part I, Item 1A., "Risk
Factors" "Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us."). We own and operate
our own facilities and do not lease mining space to other mining companies or private individuals that mine. Our wholly-owned mining operations are located in the
State of Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Wyoming in the United States. We also have a relationship with a facility located in New York State that hosts a portion of
our miners. However, on October 1, 2024, we and our hosting partner, Coinmint, LLC, agreed to a non-renewal of the agreement governing the hosting of our miners,
which is scheduled to expire January 1, 2025. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events.

**Georgia Operations**

As of September 30, 2024, our Georgia facilities have a developed data center infrastructure backed by approximately 483 MW, which supports an operational hashrate
of 20.6 EH/s. Our Georgia operations are geographically spread across eight cities.

**Mississippi Operations**

As of September 30, 2024, our Mississippi facilities have a developed data center infrastructure backed by approximately 44 MW, which supports an operational
hashrate of 2.0 EH/s. Our Mississippi operations are located in three cities and a fourth location is currently under construction.

Tennessee Operations

As of September 30, 2024, our Tennessee facilities have a developed data center infrastructure backed by 79 MW, which supports an operational hashrate of 3.5 EH/s.
We have five owned locations, two of which were operational as of September 30, 2024. Our Tennessee operations are located in six cities. Additionally, we had three
locations operating through a co-location hosting agreement with GRIID. Effective October 30, 2024, each of these co-locations became fully owned after completing
the acquisition of GRIID (see Note 5 - Acquisitions). The Company also closed on the acquisition two of additional Tennessee locations in October 2024.

Wyoming Operations

As of September 30, 2024, we have two separate mining locations in Wyoming that are under construction and are expected to be operational between the first and
second quarter of fiscal year 2025. These locations will include miners that are cooled through immersion technology, a method of submerging mining hardware in a
non-conductive fluid to cool the equipment and improve its efficiency, and are expected to have approximately 75 MW of data center infrastructure power under
contract.

The table below summarizes our portfolio of operating locations as of September 30, 2024.

<sup>(1)</sup> One of Mississippi locations is currently under construction and is expected to begin operation in December 2024.
<sup>(2)</sup> The New York location is a hosted location subject to the Coinmint co-location agreement (discussed below).
<sup>(3)</sup> Three of the Tennessee locations were previously hosted locations subject to the GRIID co-location agreement which became fully owned effective October 30,
2024 after the completion of the GRIID acquisition. Two of the five owned Tennessee locations were operational as of September 30, 2024.

Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships

We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas, including utilities, traditional and renewable energy, infrastructure,
construction, and bitcoin mining equipment procurement. In addition to operating our own mining facilities, we may engage with third-parties to host and operate mining
equipment on our behalf.

Coinmint

On July 8, 2021, our subsidiary CleanBlok, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a services agreement with Coinmint, LLC ("Coinmint").
Pursuant to the agreement, Coinmint has agreed to house and power certain of our bitcoin mining equipment in its facilities, and to use commercially reasonable efforts
to mine bitcoin on our behalf. All bitcoin mining services performed by Coinmint are conducted using our own mining equipment. All computing power generated by
our ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is contributed to our mining pool operator, Foundry Digital. As of the date of this filing, we have deployed
approximately 16,400 total miners pursuant to the co-location mining services agreement at Coinmint's facility in New York.

Pursuant to the agreement, as consideration for its services, we pay Coinmint certain services fees, which are based on the operating costs incurred by Coinmint in
performing its services, and a variable fee calculated based on the profitability of the bitcoin mined during the relevant payment period, subject to uptime performance
commitments. The agreement had an initial term of one year, after which it renews automatically for three-month periods until terminated in accordance with its terms.
On October 1, 2024, we agreed to a non-renewal of the agreement, which is scheduled to expire January 1, 2025.

Materials and Suppliers
We engage in high efficiency bitcoin mining by using ASICs. These specialized computers, often called miners, have few manufacturers. Most of the machines we
purchased this year were manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Delaware Limited ("Bitmain"), one of the top three preeminent manufacturers of bitcoin miners.
Bitmain manufactures ASICs throughout Asia with subsidiaries in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and other locations.
In addition to ASICs, mining equipment includes networking equipment, power cords, racking, other specialized equipment, transformers and energy equipment. We
rely on utility providers for our power needs. These utilities buy into local energy mixes to source power. We make every effort to establish our facilities in locations
serviced by utilities that source a substantial portion of their energy from clean and renewable sources.
We have exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices through our power providers. We actively manage these risks through activities such as the deployment of
advanced software solutions to increase unit efficiency and energy curtailment when appropriate. These energy market prices may be significantly impacted by market
conditions and geopolitical events. Historically, our methodology and operations have been efficient and resilient enough to withstand market pressures and global
events, but there can be no certainty that we will not be negatively affected in the future.
Inflationary pressures impact virtually all aspects of our materials and suppliers, including power prices, and could impact our fiscal year ending September 30, 2025.
Environmental Issues
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our direct operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by
federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not historically
been material.
Some local, state and federal policymakers have expressed concerns over the high energy consumption of data centers, including bitcoin miners, and the ancillary effects
on the environment from that energy consumption. Many media reports focus exclusively on the energy requirements of bitcoin mining and cite it as an environmental
concern. We carefully monitor existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties or accords for any material effect on our business or
markets that we serve, our operational results, our capital expenditures or our financial position.
We purchase energy from the electrical grid, and as a result our energy mix will vary from period to period based on a variety of factors including weather, temperature,
demand, and how the grid operator ultimately procures and utilizes energy resources. Historically, one of our strategies had been to prioritize sustainable and
environmentally friendly sources of energy, including nuclear energy sources. However, as we have accelerated our expansion efforts, including through multiple
acquisitions of companies and assets, where we have focused on reliability and cost of the power, our overall energy source mix has changed, subject to the factors
mentioned above. As a result, our current sources of energy include a significant portion of both non-carbon sources (including hydro, nuclear, wind and solar) and
carbon sources (including coal and natural gas). We do not, however, currently have sufficient data to quantify the current energy mix at each of our sites, and any such
data we receive is subject to the timing and details of the energy source mix information disclosed by our energy providers, including portions of the energy mix which
is not disclosed by the energy providers.

# Competition
Bitcoin mining is a global activity. During fiscal year 2021, a majority of bitcoin mining occurred in China. After China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, the center
of mining moved to North America. Bitcoin mining by its nature is a competitive business; all miners compete for the same number of bitcoin rewards. Our competitors
include large, publicly listed mining companies, large private mining companies, and, in some cases, independent, individual miners who pool resources. We define our
principal competitors as other publicly traded bitcoin miners because there is widely available information about their operations. We believe our principal competitive
advantages include our energy background, and the efficiency of our mining fleet and our operational expertise in managing uptime of our owned and operated
facilities. We strategically use bitcoin we mine as a store of value, to fund operational growth and the use of bitcoin as collateral for borrowing activities. We are
dedicated to working with communities to help stabilize energy usage to capture stranded power that can assist with reducing power rates for residential purchasers of
power. Within North America, our major competitors include:
*   MARA Holdings, Inc.;
*   Riot Platforms, Inc.;
*   Core Scientific, Inc.;
*   Bitfarms Ltd.;
*   Iris Energy Limited;
*   Cipher Mining Inc.; and,
*   Terawulf Inc.

In addition to the foregoing, we compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition
in certain operational aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining low-cost electricity, obtaining access to energy sites
with reliable sources of power and evaluating new technology developments in the industry.

# Intellectual Property
We do not currently own any patents in connection with our existing and planned bitcoin mining-related operations. We do rely, and expect to continue relying, upon
trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights.

# Government Regulation
Bitcoin mining is largely an unregulated activity at both the state and federal level. We anticipate that bitcoin mining will be a focus for increased regulation in the near-
and long-term, and we cannot predict how future regulations may affect our business or operations.

State regulation of bitcoin mining is important with respect to where we conduct our mining operations. The majority of our mining facilities are located in Georgia,
Mississippi and Tennessee, which have favorable regulatory environments for bitcoin miners. However, we also have co-location operations in New York, which has
generally been more aggressive in its regulation of bitcoin mining. We have terminated our agreement with our hosting facility in New York and effective after January
1, 2025, we will no longer have co-location activities in the state.

In addition, federal regulators have increased their enforcement activity in the digital asset industry. Federal agencies such as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ("CFTC") have brought a number of enforcement actions, including actions against significant players in the industry. In fiscal year 2023, for example, the
CFTC brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital asset commodities, representing more than 49 percent of all actions filed by the CFTC during that time
period. Increased enforcement by agencies like the SEC and CFTC has resulted in part from the failure of FTX Trading Ltd. ("FTX") in November 2022 and the
resulting market turmoil that such failure caused.

While these statements tend to focus more on digital asset exchanges and other players in the digital asset space and less on bitcoin miners, the failure of large exchanges
may impact the adoption and value of bitcoin. Additionally, because we sell our bitcoin on exchanges, we may also be impacted by exchange failures in that respect. For
those reasons, we carefully vet the exchanges we use for adequate compliance with U.S. laws as well as liquidity, using the information available to us, but we cannot be
certain that we will be able to avoid the negative effects of a large exchange failure.
As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws and regulations, including by the SEC, CFTC and other agencies, which may
affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part
I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Protection of Bitcoin Assets
Our share of bitcoins mined from our pool is initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc. ("Coinbase"), a U.S.-based digital
assets exchange. We sell portions of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold
any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoin held in cold storage is reconciled monthly and associated with unique blockchain addresses, with their activity
recorded on the blockchain. For security reasons, Coinbase does not disclose the geographic location of its cold storage wallets to its customers. Our custody agreement
with Coinbase provides that Coinbase will obtain and maintain at its sole expense insurance coverage in such types and amounts as are commercially reasonable for the
custodial services provided under the custody agreement. We do not carry additional insurance coverage on our bitcoin holdings. Further we are not aware of any
insurance providers or other third parties (e.g. auditors) having inspection or other verification rights associated with digital assets held in storage.
Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise
or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or
software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target
of hackers, malware, cyberattacks or other security threats.
See Part I, Item 1C. "Cybersecurity" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Insurance
We have property insurance coverage for our bitcoin miners under a multi-tiered insurance program with 21 different underwriters for a total of $200,000 in limits. This
insurance coverage covers all of our bitcoin miners and includes earthquake and flood insurance with a $5,000 limit. Storm, wind, and hail coverage is also included
within the $200,000 policy limit. We do not maintain Business Interruption Coverage, which is currently not commercially available for bitcoin mining companies. The
policies also exclude coverage of our bitcoin holdings and cybersecurity coverage. We engage our insurance broker annually to solicit underwriters to provide proposals
to renew our current coverage or update our policies to meet our needs, prior to the policies' expiration on November 1st of each year.
Human Resources
We believe that our future success depends, in no small part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of September 30, 2024, we had
270 staff members, all located in the United States, of which 256 were full time. We believe that we have adequate personnel and resources with the specialized skills
required to carry out our operations successfully. Employees participate in equity incentive plans and receive generous compensation in the form of salary and benefits.
We continually seek to hire and retain talented professionals, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are
represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have a strong and engaging relationship with our employees.
We cultivate trust and transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on bitcoin as we jointly strive to
build the infrastructure of the future.

# Discontinued Operations
As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on bitcoin mining operations and to
divest or dispose of the remaining energy assets. Through our discontinued operations segment, we previously provided energy solutions and we have since sold or
disposed of the related assets.

# Other Business Activities
Through our wholly owned subsidiary ATL Data Centers LLC ("ATL"), we previously provided traditional data center services to a small number of remaining clients,
such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offered several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup
services. As of September 30, 2023, ATL no longer provided data center services to external customers and all capacity of the location is now dedicated to bitcoin
mining activities.

# Risks Related to Our Business

**Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on the price of bitcoin, which has historically been volatile.**
Our primary focus on our bitcoin mining operations and our associated expansion efforts is largely based on our assumptions regarding the future value of bitcoin, which
has been subject to significant historical volatility and may be subject to influence from malicious actors, real or perceived scarcity, political, economic, and regulatory
conditions, and speculation making its price more volatile.
It is difficult to accurately predict the future market price of bitcoin, which may inhibit consumer trust in and market acceptance of bitcoin as a means of exchange,
thereby potentially limiting the future adoption of bitcoin and resulting in our assumptions proving to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect and the future
price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high, our income from our bitcoin mining operations may not exceed our costs, and our operations may never achieve profitability.

**We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never achieve consistent profitability.**
Our limited operating history, in particular our recent entry into the bitcoin mining business, makes it difficult to evaluate our business and predict our future results of
operations. Although we have achieved profitable quarters in the past, to date, we have not maintained consistent profitability from period to period, and no assurances
can be made that we will achieve consistent profitability in the near future, if ever. From the Company's inception through September 30, 2024, we sustained $479,218
in cumulative net losses, and we had a net loss from our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 of $145,777. We have generated these losses
as we execute our business plan and expand on our bitcoin mining activities as bitcoin prices have at times been in a bear market. The extent to which we will continue
to recognize losses in our continuing operations is dependent on bitcoin prices, among other factors.

**Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving industries that are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles.**
The bitcoin mining and related industries are emerging and evolving, which may lead to period-to-period variability in our operating results and may make it difficult to
evaluate our future prospects. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned
within a business cycle, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

**The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to successfully compete.**
We compete in the highly competitive market for certain operational aspects of our bitcoin mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners,
obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power and evaluating new technology
developments in the industry. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence impact the market and its various participants, including us.
Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we
do, which may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. The success of our bitcoin mining business will be dependent upon our ability to purchase additional
miners, adapt to changes in technology in the industry, and to obtain sufficient energy at reasonable prices, amongst other things.

A significant part of our success will depend on our reliance on and ability to manage our construction contractors and suppliers, including mining equipment
suppliers, in order to meet our expansion efforts in keeping with planned timelines and cost estimates, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect
our results of operations and relations with our customers.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the purchase and delivery of our miners to support our bitcoin mining operations. There can be no assurance that such key
suppliers and manufacturers will provide components, products or miners in a timely and cost-efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Any
disruption in the operations of such key suppliers or manufacturers could delay our ability to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Our ability to manage such
relationships and timely replace suppliers and manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our manufacturers and suppliers, should
that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we depend on Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan Crypt Solutions and
Sunnyside Digital for our miners and any change in their ability to manufacture or distribute and deliver these products could have a significant impact on our results of
operations. Supply chain disruptions resulting from factors such as inflation, labor supply and shipping container shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted,
and may continue to impact, us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. We are reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction
contractors and suppliers of infrastructure, to provide accurate estimates and timelines. If those parties experience delays, cannot access adequate capital, or are exposed
to inflation pressures or supply chain disruptions, our expansion efforts will be similarly impacted.
We rely heavily on our management team, whose continued service and performance is critical to our future success. Any failure by management to properly
manage growth, including hiring and retaining competent and skilled management and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition.
We currently have six executive officers - our Chief Executive Officer and President, Zachary Bradford, our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Vecchiarelli, our Executive
Chairman, S. Matthew Schultz, our Chief Operating Officer, Scott Garrison, our Chief Technology Officer, Taylor Monnig, and our Chief Accounting Officer, Brian
Carson who are responsible for our management functions and are responsible for strategic development, financing and other critical functions. Our future success
depends significantly on the continued service and performance of our existing management team. The departure, death, disability or other extended loss of services of
any member of our management team, particularly with little or no notice, could cause delays on projects, frustrate our growth prospects and could have an adverse
impact on our industry relationships, our project exploration and development programs, other aspects of our business and our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flow and prospects.
Our success, growth prospects and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain
qualified managerial personnel, including additional senior members of management. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and
customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for professionals familiar with bitcoin mining and other skilled workers is currently
high. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or
become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. If we are unable to attract
and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our company and maintain or expand our mining
operations may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our planned expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we
experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to
manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our
stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results.
We have regularly engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, technologies and personnel, such as our recent asset and business acquisitions
related to our Georgia, Mississippi, Wyoming and Tennessee properties, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we expect to seek additional opportunities to
grow our mining operations, including through purchases of miners and facilities from other operating companies, including companies in financial distress. Our ability
to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost,
our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Previous acquisitions have required, and future
acquisitions will likely require, us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders' percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities
of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic
impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring
and other related expenses and/or become subject to litigation.
The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a
timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of an acquired company or be
subjected to liability for the target's pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management's attention from normal
daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or
limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we
incur in connection with an acquisition and the potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses.
We may not be able to timely complete our future strategic growth initiatives or within our anticipated cost estimates, if at all.
As part of our efforts to grow our hashrate and remain competitive in the market, we have acquired facilities, entered into new and re-negotiated purchased power
agreements and invested in additional new and used mining equipment. We are also reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction contractors
and providers of infrastructure equipment, who may be burdened by delays in manufacturing, supply chain problems, less access to capital due to macro-economic
conditions, or inflation. This could increase our costs and/or delay our expansion and acquisition efforts. If we are unable to complete our planned expansions or
acquisitions on schedule and within our anticipated cost estimates, our deployment of newly purchased miners may be delayed, which could affect our competitiveness
and our results of operation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price for our securities.
We may experience increased compliance costs as a result of future strategic acquisitions.
Future strategic acquisitions could carry substantial compliance burdens, which may limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and which
may require our management and personnel to shift their focus to such compliance burdens and away from their other functions. Such increased costs and compliance
burdens could affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such strategic acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer
as a result.

In the future, we may require additional financing to sustain and expand our operations, and we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.
Our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business is dependent upon, among other things, generating sufficient revenue from our operations and, when and if
needed, obtaining financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate and/or expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund
operating deficits (if applicable) and the growth of our business, pursue our business plans and to finance our operating activities, including through equity or debt
financings, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain capital through sales of bitcoin may also be impacted by the volatility in
the price of bitcoin.
We have previously raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our at-the-market
offering program, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives.
Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to
obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholder ownership interest in the Company may be diluted, and
the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may
involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares of common stock, making
investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits.
We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in
accounts at banking institutions in the United States that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in these accounts often exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of the amounts held in excess of such insurance
limitations. The FDIC took control of three such banking institutions, Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023, Signature Bank on March 12, 2023 and First Republic
Bank on May 1, 2023. While we did not have an account at any of these three banks, in the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our
cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in
accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. Our ability to open accounts at certain financial institutions is limited by the policies of
such financial institutions to not accept clients that are in the digital asset industry.
The impact of geopolitical and economic events on the demand for bitcoin is uncertain.
Geopolitical crises may trigger large-scale purchases of bitcoin, which could rapidly increase the price of bitcoin. This may, however, also increase the likelihood of a
subsequent price swing in the opposite direction as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, ultimately decreasing the value of bitcoin or any other digital asset in our
possession. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in generally uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold.
Alternatively, global crises and economic downturns may discourage investment in bitcoin and digital assets in general as investors shift their investments towards less
volatile asset classes. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin we mine or otherwise
acquire or hold for our own account.

The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the
foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin's price volatility and surrounding risks.
The market price of one bitcoin in our principal market ranged from approximately $26,500 to $73,800 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, $15,500 to
$31,900 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and ranged from approximately $17,600 to $69,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. While
bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and
are impacted by a variety of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin, the maintenance and
development of the software protocol of the bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived
scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future
appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more volatile.
Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell.
Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Such decisions,
however well-informed, may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging
activities related to our holding of bitcoin; this would expose us to substantial decreases in the price of bitcoin.
The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other
alternatives.
The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to abandon bitcoin. As we exclusively mine bitcoin, and
expect to exclusively mine bitcoin in the future, we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains or alternatives thereto. This could prevent us
from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and
potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and therefore harm investors.
Bitcoin is subject to halving; the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the
reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.
Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event
referred to as bitcoin "halving," the bitcoin reward for mining any block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin on
April 19, 2024. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks. It is estimated that bitcoin will next halve in April 2028 and then approximately every four
years thereafter until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21 million bitcoin are generated, the
network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 19 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around
halving events, there is no guarantee that any such price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and
proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not
have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in us.
Furthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hashrate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for
miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for
transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on the
blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in us.

Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us.
We currently rely on Foundry Digital's open access mining pool ("pool") that supports bitcoin to receive our mining rewards and fees from the network. Our pool has
the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with our pool may change. In general, mining
pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting rewarded by the bitcoin network. The
rewards, distributed proportionally to our contribution to the pool's overall mining power, are distributed by the pool operator. Should our pool's operator systems suffer
downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, our ability to mine and receive revenue will be negatively impacted. Furthermore, while we
receive daily reports from our pool detailing the total processing power provided to the pool and the proportion of that total processing power we provided to determine
the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of our pool's record keeping. Therefore, we have little means of recourse against our pool's operator
if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pools. If we are unable to consistently obtain
accurate proportionate rewards from our pool, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.

Forks in the bitcoin network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of bitcoins held by us.
A small group of contributors can propose refinements or improvements to the bitcoin network's source code that alter the protocols and software that govern the bitcoin
network and the properties of bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin. This is known as a "fork." In the event a
developer or group of developers proposes modifications to the bitcoin network that are not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that are nonetheless accepted
by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a "hard fork."
The value of bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of
the fork product and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, existing forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and future forks may have a negative effect on
bitcoin's value and may adversely affect an investment in us.

The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions
in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us.
As an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the
bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to
adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors
may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially
the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.

Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities.
A number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to
provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and
may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or
hold for our own account.

# Bitcoins held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.

We do not hold our bitcoins with a banking institution or a member of the FDIC or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC"), and, therefore, our bitcoins
are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. As a result, we may suffer a loss with respect to our bitcoins that are not
covered by insurance, and we may not be able to recover any of our carried value in these bitcoins if they are lost or stolen or suffer significant and sustained reduction in
conversion spot price. If we are not otherwise able to recover damages in connection with these losses, our business and results of operations may suffer, which may
have a material negative impact on our stock price.

# Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.

There is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Bitcoins are stored in and accessed by cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as "wallets." A
hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they
are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold
storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 99% of our bitcoin
in cold storage and 1% in hot wallets. Due to our usage of in cold storage, we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our
cryptocurrency assets.

We currently mine bitcoin by contributing to and benefiting from our pool's processing power. Our share of bitcoins mined from our pool is initially received by us in
wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase. We currently sell the majority of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this bitcoin immediately prior
to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft
or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code,
exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of
substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats.

In addition, our borrowings under the Master Loan (as defined below) are collateralized by approximately $78,125 of bitcoin as of September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the
terms of the Master Loan and related security agreement, Coinbase has the right to sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, use or otherwise dispose of the bitcoin
collateralizing our borrowings under the Master Loan. This could increase our exposure to the risk of a counterparty default since, under such circumstances, we may be
unable to recover the posted collateral promptly or may be unable to recover all of the posted collateral Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and,
consequently, our investments and profitability.

# If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the network
to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us.

If a malicious actor or botnet, a collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers, obtains over 50% of the processing
power dedicated to mining bitcoin, such actor or botnet may be able to construct fraudulent blocks or prevent certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or
at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the order of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control.
The malicious actor or botnet could also "double-spend," or spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction, or it could prevent transactions from being validated. In
certain instances, reversing any fraudulent or malicious changes made to the bitcoin blockchain may not be possible.

Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin
network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded, and could exceed, the 50% threshold on the bitcoin network. This possibility creates a greater risk
that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, and the administrators of mining
pools, do not have adequate controls and responses in place, the risk of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power may increase. If such an event were
to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for
our own account and harm investors.

The loss or destruction of private keys required to access our bitcoins may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss
relating to our bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in us.
Bitcoins may only be controlled by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held. We
publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt or transfers of bitcoins to and from our wallets and disseminate such information into
the network on an anonymous basis, but we safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. Digital asset exchanges, such as Coinbase, where we hold our
bitcoin, engage in similar practices. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoins and such
private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our bitcoins whether by us or digital
asset exchanges where we hold our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine
or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.
The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and
failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us.
Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public
with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose
confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital
asset trading.
A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or
malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These
potential consequences of a digital asset exchange's failure could adversely affect an investment in us.
We may face several risks due to disruptions in the digital asset markets, including but not limited to the risk from depreciation in our stock price, financing risk,
risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments or other assets, risks of legal proceedings and government investigations, and risks from price declines or
price volatility of digital assets.
In the second half of 2022 and beginning of 2023, some of the well-known digital asset market participants, including Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., Three
Arrows Capital and Genesis Global Holdco LLC, declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative
publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX, the third-largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals,
and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy.
In response to these and other similar events (including significant activity by various regulators regarding digital asset activities, such as enforcement actions, against a
variety of digital asset entities, including Coinbase, Kraken and Binance), the digital asset markets, including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced
extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in
the digital asset markets and in bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital asset markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX and
platforms such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance have engaged, or may continue to engage, in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital asset markets
continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital asset prices (including the price of bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence
in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. These events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may
pose to us, our service providers or on the digital asset industry as a whole.

Although we had no direct exposure to FTX or any of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency companies (with the exception of Coinbase, which is discussed in "-
Potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be
considered a general unsecured creditor thereof"), nor any material assets that may not be recovered or may otherwise be lost or misappropriated due to the above-
mentioned bankruptcies, the failure or insolvency of large exchanges like FTX or other significant players in the digital asset space may cause the price of bitcoin to fall
and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could adversely affect an investment in us. Such market volatility has had a material and adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by bitcoin's price as the results of our operations are significantly
tied to the price of bitcoin. If we do not continue adjusting our short-term strategy to optimize our operating efficiency in the current dynamic market conditions, such
market conditions could have a further negative result on our business, prospects or operations.

We may not have adequate sources of recovery if our bitcoin holdings are lost, stolen or destroyed.

We rely on Coinbase to facilitate the custody of our bitcoins. If our bitcoin holdings are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party, including
Coinbase, liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only
source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial
resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of ours. While Coinbase maintains insurance coverage of such types and amounts as Coinbase
asserts to be commercially reasonable for its custodial services provided under the Company's custody agreement with Coinbase, including certain commercial crime
insurance of limited aggregate principal amount which covers losses stemming from fraud, security breach, hack and asset theft, such insurance coverage may be
insufficient to protect the Company against all losses of its bitcoin holdings held in custody with Coinbase, whether or not stemming from security breaches,
cyberattacks or other types of unlawful activity. See "-Our limited insurance protection exposes us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our bitcoin for which no
person is liable."
Our ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends and reliance on a third party, Coinbase, for custody pose a challenge to the
safekeeping of our bitcoin holdings.

The history of digital asset exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard
their digital assets. All of the bitcoin we hold is held in either cold or hot storage by Coinbase. We rely on Coinbase's security systems, derived from established,
industry-best practices, to safeguard our bitcoin holdings from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. We believe that we
may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of our bitcoin holdings grow. To the extent that either Coinbase or we are unable to identify and
mitigate or stop new security threats, our bitcoin holdings may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could adversely affect an investment in us. To
the extent that Coinbase is no longer able to safeguard our assets, we would be at risk of loss if safeguarding protocols fail.

Any potential use of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and generative artificial intelligence could lead to unintended consequences
and result in reputational harm and litigation.

We continue to evaluate emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and generative artificial intelligence for incorporation into our business.
State and federal regulations relating to these emerging technologies are quickly evolving, and, should we adopt such technologies, we may require significant resources
to maintain our business practices while seeking to comply with U.S. laws. Any failure to accurately identify and address our responsibilities and liabilities in this new
environment could negatively affect any solutions we develop incorporating such technologies and could subject us to reputational harm, regulatory action or litigation,
any of which may harm our financial condition and operating results. These same risks apply to our use of third-party service providers who are implementing these
tools into the products or services they provide to us.

Security threats to us could result in a loss of our bitcoin holdings or damage to our reputation and brand, each of which could adversely affect an investment in us.
Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the digital asset exchange markets, for example since the launch of
the bitcoin network. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional
malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm our
business operations or result in loss of our bitcoin holdings. Any breach of our infrastructure could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect an
investment in us. Furthermore, we believe that, as our assets grow, we may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware.

We rely on Coinbase's security systems, derived from established, industry-best practices, to safeguard our bitcoin holdings from theft, loss, destruction or other issues
relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, Coinbase's security systems may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of
God, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God may be borne by us.
Our security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of ours, or otherwise, and,
as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our private keys, data or bitcoin. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of
ours to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or
sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we
may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security systems occurs, the market
perception of the effectiveness of our security systems could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment in us.
In the event of a security breach, we may be forced to cease operations, or suffer a reduction in assets, the occurrence of each of which could adversely affect an
investment in us.

A loss of confidence in our security systems, or a breach of our security systems, may adversely affect us and the value of an investment in us.
We will take measures to protect us and our bitcoin from unauthorized access, damage or theft; however, it is possible that our security systems may not prevent the
improper access to, or damage or theft of, our bitcoin holdings. A security breach could harm our reputation or result in the loss of some or all of our bitcoin. A resulting
perception that our measures do not adequately protect our bitcoin holdings could result in a loss of current or potential stockholders, reducing demand for our common
stock and causing our shares to decrease in value.

Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions
could adversely affect an investment in us.
Bitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory,
control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the bitcoin network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the
blockchain, an incorrect transfer of bitcoin or a theft of bitcoin generally will not be reversible, and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer
or theft. While we exchange our bitcoin directly for U.S. dollars on Coinbase and do not presently use, or expect to use, our bitcoin for any other transactions other than
limited payroll-related payments, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin could be transferred from us in
incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that we are unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or are incapable of identifying
the third party which has received our bitcoin through error or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred bitcoin. To the extent that
we are unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect an investment in us.

We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on not only the price of bitcoin but also our ability to mine bitcoin.
A disruption of the Internet may adversely affect the mining and use of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining
bitcoin are dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt bitcoin's network operations until the disruption is resolved and
have an adverse effect on the price of bitcoin and our ability to mine bitcoin.
The limited rights of legal recourse available to us expose us and our investors to the risk of loss of our bitcoins for which no person is liable.
At this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring
an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency; though law enforcement agencies like the FBI have recovered stolen bitcoin, that recovery has
required significant amounts of time. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.
The sale of our bitcoins to pay for expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect an investment in us.
We sell our bitcoins to pay for operating expenses and growth on an as-needed basis. Consequently, we may sell our bitcoins at a time when bitcoin prices are low, which
could adversely affect an investment in us. At this time, we do not engage in contractual or financial hedging activities related to our bitcoin holdings to mitigate
potential decreases in the price of bitcoin. See the above risk factor entitled, "The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not
currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin's price volatility and surrounding risks.
Demand for bitcoin is driven, in part, by its status as a prominent and secure cryptocurrency. It is possible that a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin could have
features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoin.
Bitcoin holds a "first-to-market" advantage over other cryptocurrencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more
importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Nonetheless, another form of cryptocurrency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or
exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market
share, this could reduce the interest in, and value of, bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin operations.
Our mining costs may be in excess of our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business and adversely impact an investment in us.
Mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. Increases in mining expenses may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue (i.е.,
the value of bitcoin mined). Our expenses may become greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more cost-efficient may not succeed.
Further, even if our expenses remain the same or decline, our revenues may not exceed our expenses to the extent the price of bitcoin decreases without a corresponding
decrease in bitcoin network difficulty. Increases in our costs without corresponding increases in our revenue would adversely affect our profitability and could seriously
harm our business and an investment in us.

The properties included in our mining operations may experience damages, including damages that may not be covered by insurance.
Our current mining locations and any future sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including but not limited
to:
⚫construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;
⚫any noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;
⚫any damage resulting from natural disasters and climate change, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms; and
⚫claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our properties.
Although our mining sites are equipped with standard security measures normally associated with a traditional data center, and insured by tier one insurance providers,
our mining sites could still be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other events outside of our
control. For a summary of our insurance coverage, see "Business Insurance." The measures we have taken, and may take in the future, to prevent and insure against
these risks may prove to not be sufficient or effective.
We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power.
The operation of a bitcoin mining facility requires significant amounts of electrical power. Any mining site we currently operate or establish in the future can only be
successful if we can continue to obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis. Our mining operations are conducted across a mix of fully-owned
campuses, leased properties, and active hosting agreements, each of which have unique power agreements. Geopolitical events including the war in Ukraine and
inflationary impacts have caused power prices to increase worldwide; if power prices continue to increase while bitcoin prices decrease, our ability to profitability mine
bitcoin would be negatively impacted.
We may curtail the energy used by our mining operations in times of heightened energy prices or in the case of a grid-wide electricity shortage either voluntarily or by
agreement with utility providers. We may also encounter other situations where utilities or government entities restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining
operations. In these cases, our ability to produce bitcoin may be negatively affected.
Because we also expect to expand to additional sites, there may be significant competition for suitable locations with access to affordable power.
Additionally, our facilities could be adversely affected by a power outage. Although we maintain limited backup power at certain sites, it would not be feasible to run
miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. To the extent we are unable to receive adequate power
supply and are forced to reduce or cease our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, our business would be adversely affected.

Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices and the impacts of climate change may result in additional costs
or risks.

Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices. Investor advocacy groups,
certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing
importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. In May 2021, the SEC proposed rule changes that would require public companies to include certain
climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their
business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements noting that
such rule changes were proposed in response to investor demands for consistent and comparable data on climate change. Furthermore, increased public awareness and
concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management
team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny and reassuring our employees. The implementation of
the SEC's proposed rule changes was stayed in April 2024 in response to consolidated legal challenges. However, should the rule changes ultimately become effective,
in either their current or a revised form, we, as a public company, may also face increased oversight from the SEC with respect to our climate-related disclosures.

The physical risks of climate change may also impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supplies of energy, and demand for bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather
events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or
adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of
climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.

Our operations and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies.

We compete with other users and/or companies that are mining bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to bitcoin. Market
and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies
directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have increased
scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, and such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully establish or maintain a public market for our securities.
Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire
or hold for our own account, and harm investors.

From time to time, as market conditions change, large holders of bitcoin may sell large amounts all at once into the market, thereby constraining the growth of the
price of bitcoin.

There are very large holders of bitcoin, including other miners, that may choose or be forced to sell large quantities of bitcoin all at once or over a short period of time.
Such an increase in selling volume could create downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin.

Potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be
considered a general unsecured creditor thereof.

All of the bitcoin we hold is held in either cold or hot storage by Coinbase. The treatment of bitcoins held by custodians that file for bankruptcy protection is uncharted
territory in U.S. Bankruptcy law. We cannot say with certainty whether our bitcoin held in custody by Coinbase, should it declare bankruptcy, would be treated as
property of the bankruptcy estate and, accordingly, whether we would be treated as a general unsecured creditor with respect of our bitcoin held in custody by Coinbase.
If we are treated as a general unsecured creditor, we may not be able to recover our bitcoin in the event of a Coinbase bankruptcy or a bankruptcy of any other custodian
we may use in the future.

There are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware disruption and difficulty in obtaining
new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.
As our mining facilities operate, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear and may face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors
beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will also require us, over time, to repair or replace miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as technology
evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and
we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis.
Further, the global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers headquartered in China, with manufacturing in Asia, which was
severely affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently utilize several types of ASIC miners as part of our mining operation, including Bitmain
Antminers, Canaan Avalon miners and MicroBT WhatsMiners, all of which are produced in China, Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand. Geopolitical matters, including the
relationship of the U.S. with China, may impact our ability to import ASIC miners. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing
miners or obtain additional miners from manufacturers on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and
potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.
*Since there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, including bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for
transactions involving digital assets.*
Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been
provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC as to bitcoin miners, it is unclear how bitcoin miners may in the future be required to account for
cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretations by the SEC,
particularly as they relate to the Company and the financial accounting of our bitcoin-related operations, could result in changes in our accounting treatment and the
necessity to restate our financial statements. In addition, the accounting policies of many companies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the
public, and we have received comments from the staff of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance Office of Crypto Assets (the "Staff") during fiscal year 2023 related
to the accounting of our bitcoin-related operations, which have been resolved. Such continued uncertainty with regard to financial accounting matters, particularly as
they relate to the Company, the financial accounting of our bitcoin-related operations and the SEC comments we have received in respect of such matters, could
negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to raise capital.
*If we fail to grow our hashrate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.*
Generally, a bitcoin miner's chance of solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain and earning a bitcoin reward is a function of the miner's hashrate (i.e., the amount of
computing power devoted to supporting the bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hashrate. As demand for bitcoin has increased, the global network
hashrate has increased, and to the extent more adoption of bitcoin occurs, we would expect the demand for bitcoin would increase, drawing more mining companies into
the industry and further increasing the global network hashrate. As new and more powerful and energy-efficient mining servers are deployed, the global network
hashrate will continue to increase, meaning a miner's respective percentage of the total daily rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hashrate at pace with the
growth of global hashrate. Accordingly, to compete in this highly competitive industry, we believe we will need to continue to acquire new miners, both to replace those
lost to ordinary wear and tear and other damage, and to increase our hashrate to keep up with a growing global network hashrate.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we grew our hashrate, in part, by acquiring newer, more powerful and energy-efficient miners through sales and
purchase agreements with suppliers, and we plan to continue to acquire new miners to compete effectively in the market. These new miners are highly specialized servers
that are very difficult to produce at scale. As a result, there are limited producers capable of producing large numbers of sufficiently effective miners. The cost of these
miners is directly correlated to bitcoin prices and the profitability of bitcoin mining. Demand for new miners increased in response to increased bitcoin prices in 2021
followed by a decreased in demand due to falling bitcoin prices in 2022. We observed the price of these new miners followed changes in demand, resulting in elevated
machine prices when bitcoin mining economics are high and significantly lower prices when these economics are strained. As a result, positive bitcoin economics may
negatively impact our future equipment costs and increase the competition to secure mining equipment. If we are unable to acquire sufficient numbers of new miners or
access sufficient capital to fund our acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect investments in
our securities.
Global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy and potential economic recession,
and geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the subsequent imposition of sanctions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
General economic and political conditions such as economic recessions, interest rates, rising inflation, commodity prices, foreign currency fluctuations, international
tariffs, social, political and economic risks, hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, military conflict and acts of war, including further escalation of
the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the related response, including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and/or other countries, as well as the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, could adversely impact our business, supply chain or partners. The U.S. inflation rate steadily increased since 2021 and into 2022 and 2023. These
inflationary pressures, as well as disruptions in our supply chain, have increased the costs of most other goods, services and personnel, which have in turn caused our
capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates,
which have raised the cost of acquiring capital and reduced economic growth, either of which-or the combination thereof could hurt the financial and operating
results of our business. In addition, the extent and duration of the situation in Ukraine, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions are impossible to
predict, but could be significant.
The effects of such global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy or potential economic
recession, and geopolitical events could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets, and if so, we may need to consider alternative
sources of funding for some of our growth and operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital.
Divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our
financial results.
In connection with the execution of our strategy to focus entirely on bitcoin mining, we have completed several divestitures, including the divestiture of a part of our
former energy business. We intend to make further dispositions in connection with our non-bitcoin mining related businesses, which we may not be able to complete on
favorable terms or at all. If we do not realize the expected benefits of these divestitures or our post-completion liabilities and continuing obligations are substantial and
exceed our expectations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
As a result of such dispositions, bitcoin mining is now the sole driver of our business and revenues and is expected to continue to be the source of substantially all of our
revenues for the foreseeable future, which has the effect of increasing our exposure to the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Further, in the course of our discontinued operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our legacy energy products are or were defective in
workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We may also be subject to lawsuits and other claims in the future if our legacy products or installed systems
malfunction, including, for example, if any of our energy system offerings (such as installed racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other
products) causes injuries. Because energy systems and many of our other products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that customers or their property could
be injured or damaged by our products, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, since our products are used in
systems that are made up of components sourced from third-party manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction.
Additionally, any of our products could be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects.

The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant
payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, thereby damaging our reputation and competitive position. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties
provided by our manufacturing partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance.
Such warranties and insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if such warranties and insurance coverage are sufficient, any
successful claim could significantly harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

*Our limited insurance protection exposes us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our bitcoin for which no person is liable.*

We do not currently maintain our own insurance coverage for our bitcoin holdings, which are held in custody by Coinbase. In addition, while Coinbase maintains
insurance coverage of such types and amounts as Coinbase asserts to be commercially reasonable for its custodial services provided under the Company's custody
agreement with Coinbase, including certain commercial crime insurance of limited aggregate principal amount which covers losses stemming from fraud, security
breach, hack and asset theft, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect the Company against all losses of its bitcoin holdings held in custody with Coinbase,
whether or not stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks or other types of unlawful activity. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to our bitcoin that is not
covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages, which could adversely affect our operations and, consequently, an investment in us.

*Noise Pollution and Community Opposition*

The Company's Mining operations involve the use of a large numbers of high-powered Miners and cooling systems that generate significant noise. This noise can pose
several risks to the Company's business including community complaints, reputational damage, litigation risk, regulatory risk, operational constraints, increased costs
and opposition to expansion. These risks could lead to fines or penalties imposed by local governments, requirements to implement costly noise mitigation measures,
restrictions on the Company's operating hours, reduction of scale of the Company's operations, stricter noise controls regulations on the Company's operations, potential
shutdown of data centers that cannot meet local noise regulations, damages resulting from lawsuits and difficulty obtaining necessary permits and approvals for
expanding existing data centers or establishing new site operations. While the Company strives to be a good corporate citizen and mitigate noise impacts where possible,
the inherently noisy nature of large-scale cryptocurrency Mining operations presents ongoing risks to the Company's business that may negatively affect its financial
condition and results of operations.

# Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement Operations
If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of
the BSA, or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these
regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations.

To the extent our bitcoin mining activities cause us to be deemed a money services business (an "MSB") under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the "BSA"), we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including
those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.

To the extent that our cryptocurrency activities cause us to be deemed a "money transmitter" (an "MT") or be given an equivalent designation under state law in any
state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the
implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of
Financial Services maintains a comprehensive "BitLicense" framework for businesses that conduct "virtual currency business activity." Effective August 2020,
Louisiana enacted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act. The implementing regulations were formally adopted in late 2022. In October 2023, California enacted the
Digital Financial Assets Law, which requires registration for certain digital financial asset business activities. We will continue to monitor for developments in state-level
legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to us.

Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations in the United States or obligations that could arise under the regulatory frameworks of other countries may cause
us to incur significant expenses, possibly affecting our business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers
may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs or similar obligations in other countries. If we are
deemed to be subject to such additional regulatory oversight and registration or licensing requirements, we may be required to substantially alter our bitcoin mining
activities and possibly cease engaging in such activities. Any such action may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and an investment in our
company.

Current regulation regarding the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation by the CFTC in
connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant.

The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the "CEA"), does not currently impose any direct obligations on us related to the mining or exchange of bitcoins.
Generally, the CFTC, the federal agency that administers the CEA, regards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities. This position has been supported by
decisions of federal courts.

However, the CEA imposes requirements relative to certain transactions involving bitcoin and other digital assets that constitute a contract of sale of a commodity for
future delivery (or an option on such a contract), a swap or a transaction involving margin, financing or leverage that does not result in actual delivery of the commodity
within 28 days to persons not defined as "eligible contract participants" or "eligible commercial entities" under the CEA (e.g., retail persons). Changes in the CEA or the
regulations promulgated by the CFTC thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the CFTC, may impact the classification of bitcoin
and, therefore, may subject bitcoin to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or
non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the
CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive
practices).

We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoin under the law. Any requirements imposed by the CFTC related to
our mining activities or our transactions in bitcoin could cause us to incur additional extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely
impacting an investment in the Company.
30

# Page 31 of 134

Moreover, if our mining activities or transactions in bitcoin were deemed by the CFTC to constitute a collective investment in derivatives for our stockholders, we may
be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary,
non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If we determine not to comply with such additional
regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in the Company.
While no provision of the CEA or CFTC rules, orders or rulings (except as noted herein) appear to be currently applicable to our business, this is subject to change.

*If the SEC or another regulatory body considers bitcoin to be a security under U.S. securities laws, we may be required to comply with significant SEC registration
and/or other requirements.*

In general, novel or unique assets such as bitcoin and other digital assets may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S.
law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc.'s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc.'s TON tokens, have
been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. While we believe that bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the
investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that digital assets that we may mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, including
bitcoin, will never be classified as securities under U.S. law. This would obligate us to comply with registration and other requirements by the SEC and, therefore, cause
us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company.

*It may be illegal now, or in the future, to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar
cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect us.*

Although currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, several countries, such as China, India and Russia, may
continue taking regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrency assets or to exchange any
such cryptocurrency assets for local currency. For example, in China and Russia (India is currently proposing new legislation), it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. In addition, in March 2021, the
governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia banned bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry's intense electrical power demands and
its negative environmental impacts. If other countries, including the U.S., implement similar restrictions, such restrictions may adversely affect us. For example, in New
York State, a moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources was signed into law on November 22, 2022. Such circumstances
could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or
other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and thus harm investors.

*Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks.*

Our bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for electricity,
are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that
mine on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. For instance, our plans and strategic initiatives for
expansion are based, in part, on our understanding of current environmental and energy regulations, policies and initiatives enacted by federal and state regulators. If
new regulations are imposed, or if existing regulations are modified, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we
may incur additional costs to adapt our planned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations.

In addition, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the bitcoin mining
industry, with its high energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate
change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased renewable energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental
monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to
compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. For example, the recently passed legislation in the state of New York imposing a moratorium
on certain bitcoin mining operations that run carbon-based power.
Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation
will affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global
marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a
material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
*If we fail to qualify for certain state government tax incentives or to comply with local tax regulations, we may suffer financial losses.*
We expect to negotiate for certain sale and use tax incentives from U.S. state governments in exchange for encouraging investment and employment. Our interpretations
and conclusions regarding these potential tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority. If our assumptions about, or interpretation or implementation of, tax and
other laws are incorrect; if tax laws or regulations are substantially modified or rescinded; if the tax incentives from which we benefit in the jurisdictions in which we
operate are substantially modified or rescinded; if we fail to meet the conditions of any of the tax incentives; or if we do not prevail in disputes with tax authorities, we
could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, including owing significant amounts of taxes and penalties that would increase our expenses, reduce
our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
*Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes could adversely impact
our business.*
Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital assets and related transactions, many
significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax treatment of transactions involving digital assets, such as the purchase and sale
of bitcoin and the receipt of staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the
future with respect to the tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions.
Current Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") guidance indicates that for U.S. federal income tax purposes digital assets such as bitcoins should be treated and taxed as
property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoins for goods and services should be treated in effect as barter transactions. The IRS has also released
guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to taxable income and guidance with respect to the
determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, current IRS guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of
digital assets and related transactions. Moreover, although current IRS guidance addresses the treatment of certain forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to
the timing and amount of income inclusions for various digital asset transactions, including, but not limited to, staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and
rewards products. While current IRS guidance creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one
person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions, which is generally favorable for investors in bitcoin.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its existing position with respect to digital assets in the future or that other state, local and non-U.S. taxing
authorities or courts will follow the approach of the IRS with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as bitcoin for income tax and sales tax purposes. Any such
alteration of existing guidance or issuance of new or different guidance may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in
bitcoin or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin, generally, and potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of bitcoin or
otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase
the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes.

Our interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed
ledger technology.
The Office of Financial Assets Control ("OFAC") of the Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its
specially designated nationals ("SDN") list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge
engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC's SDN list. We also may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the persons with whom
we transact.
Risks Related to Our Securities
The price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,
including, without limitation:
⚫technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors;
⚫government regulation;
⚫the establishment of partnerships with other technology companies;
⚫intellectual property disputes;
⚫additions or departures of key personnel;
⚫sales of our common stock;
⚫our ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services;
⚫our ability to execute our business plan;
⚫operating results below expectations;
•loss of any strategic relationship;
⚫industry developments;
⚫economic and other external factors; and
•period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.
In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of
particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Specifically, the trading price of our common stock has already been correlated, and, in the future, as we continue to expand our bitcoin mining business, may be
increasingly correlated, to the trading prices of bitcoin. The stocks of bitcoin mining companies have shown volatility relative to bitcoin. Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed herein), are determined primarily
by using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. As noted elsewhere herein, while we had no direct exposure to FTX, the
failure or insolvency of large exchanges like FTX may cause the price of bitcoin to fall and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could negatively impact our
stock price. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to
additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result
of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more. For
example, the closing sales price of our common stock on September 30, 2023 was $3.81 and the closing price of bitcoin was $26,961 and, as of September 30, 2024, the
closing sales price of our common stock was $9.34, and the closing price (per Coinbase) of bitcoin was $63,301.

In addition, the stock markets in general have often experienced volatility, including in the wake of COVID-19, that has sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to
the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations have caused, and may continue to cause, the trading price of our common stock to
decline. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital,
on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects, and on the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of
volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this
type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management's attention and resources from the operation of our
business.
We have the right to designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock. If we were to designate and/or issue additional preferred stock, it is likely to have
rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.
We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of blank-check preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our
Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the
dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred
stock. For example, on August 30, 2024, we filed a certificate of designation (the "Certificate of Designation") with the Nevada Secretary of State, effective as of the
time of filing, designating the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of our Series X Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Series X Preferred Stock"),
in connection with a vote to increase the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance from 300,000,000 shares to 600,000,000 shares (the "Authorized
Share Increase") at our special meeting of stockholders held on October 25, 2024. The Certificate of Designation provided that each share of Series X Preferred Stock
would have 1,000 votes and vote together with the outstanding shares of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on the Authorized Share Increase. Each
outstanding share of Series X Preferred Stock was redeemed automatically and effective immediately after we published the final results of the stockholder vote on the
Authorized Share Increase.
Currently, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares are outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are
entitled to have the Company redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for three shares of our common stock only if a change of control event (as defined in the
certificate of designation) occurs, and they are entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to stockholders at a rate of forty-
five (45) votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held.
The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and
powers of our common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in
the book value per share of our common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or
discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in our common stock. We cannot assure that we will not,
under certain circumstances, issue additional shares of our preferred stock.
We are currently the subject of a shareholder class action, and may be subject to shareholder litigation in the future; our costs of defending such litigation,
arbitration and other proceedings and any adverse outcome of such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding may have a material adverse effect on our business
and the results of our operations.
We are currently, and may from time to time in the future be, involved in and subject to material litigation and other legal proceedings. In particular, on January 20,
2021, a purported stockholder of the Company, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint (the "Class Complaint")
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain members of our executive management team. The Class Complaint
alleges that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, we and certain members of our executive management team failed to disclose certain material
information to investors and that, as a result of the foregoing, our positive statements about our business, operations and prospects were materially misleading and/or
lacked a reasonable basis. The claims made in the Class Complaint appear to be derived from a short seller report that was published about us.

We have financed our strategic growth primarily by issuing new shares of our common stock in public offerings, which dilutes the ownership interests of our
current stockholders, and which may adversely affect the market price of our securities.

We have raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our current and former at-the-
market offering programs, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of our expansion initiatives and
any expansion initiatives we may undertake in the future. Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where
trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and
adversely impact our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and
the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of any debt we issue would likely have priority over the
holders of shares of our common stock in terms of order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional
indebtedness or take other actions, including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our
stockholders.
We have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock in the past and have no immediate plans to do so in the future.
We have not paid, and do not plan to pay in the immediate future, any cash dividends with respect to our common stock. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the
extent we have earnings, in order to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We cannot assure stockholders that we will, at any time,
generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, stockholders should not expect to
receive cash dividends on our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading
opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the
analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease
coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading
volume to decline.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.
In April 2022, we entered into a Master Equipment Financing Agreement with Trinity Capital Inc., as the lender (the "Financing Agreement"). The Financing Agreement
provided for up to $35,000 of borrowings to finance finance our acquisition of blockchain computing equipment. We received a loan of $20,000 at close, with the remaining
$15,000 not requested for funding and cancelled. As of September 30, 2024, $5,171 in principal was outstanding and due to Trinity Capital Inc.
The borrowings under the Financing Agreement are collateralized by 3,336 S19j Pro miners, which are located at our College Park, GA and Norcross, GA sites. The
value of the miners collateralizing the borrowings under the Financing Agreement may be negatively impacted by adverse events affecting the digital asset markets
and/or volatility in the price of bitcoin. Should we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and should Trinity Capital Inc. foreclose on the miners
collateralizing our indebtedness, we could potentially lose up to 0.33 EH/s of computing power, or 1% of our current computing power. In addition, to the extent the
value of the miners securing our borrowings under the Financing Agreement decreases and falls the below the aggregate amount of our obligations under the Financing
Agreement, the lender thereunder would be our unsecured creditor in respect of the difference in the value of the the collateral and our obligations.
In August 2024, we entered into a Master Loan Agreement (the "Master Loan") with Coinbase Credit, Inc., as the lender (the "Lender"). The Master Loan provides for a
line of credit under which the Lender may lend us digital assets or cash. We received $50,000 in financing under the Master Loan during the year ended September 30,
2024, and, as of September 30, 2024, $50,000 in principal was outstanding and due to the Lender. The borrowings under the Master Loan are collateralized by
approximately $78,125 of bitcoin as of September 30, 2024.

Our indebtedness could:
*   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
*   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;
*   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
*   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
*   result in greater interest rate risk and volatility;
*   limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and
*   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our Financing Agreement under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all.

In addition, if the value of bitcoin declines precipitously, the value of our collateral under the Master Loan would also decline. In such case, we could be required to provide Coinbase with additional collateral in the form of bitcoin. If we are unable to do so, we could default under the Master Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

We incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; any failure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and/or disclosure controls or to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements and otherwise make timely and accurate public disclosure.

As a public company, we incur significant administrative, legal, accounting and other burdens and expenses beyond those of a private company, including public company reporting obligations and Nasdaq listing requirements. In particular, we have needed, and continue to need, to enhance and supplement our internal accounting resources with additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite technical and public company experience and expertise to enable us to satisfy such reporting obligations. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls (including internal control over financial reporting) could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and stockholders claims.

Furthermore, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and prepare annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our assessments must include disclosure of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting involves significant costs and could divert management's attention from other matters that are important to our business. Additionally, we may not be successful in remediating any deficiencies that may be identified.

Our management has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future.
If we fail to remediate the material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately
and timely report our financial results may be affected, and such failure may adversely affect investor confidence and business operations.
In the course of preparing our fiscal year 2024 financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
To address our material weaknesses, we need to make changes to our program and controls as set forth in Part II, Item 9A "Controls and Procedures." We will not be
able to remediate these material weaknesses unless and until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We
cannot assure you that the measures we plan to take will in fact be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting or that such measures will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses, and our current controls and any new controls that we
develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be
discovered in the future.
If we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses and otherwise implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to record,
process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements and satisfy our public reporting obligations within required time periods, could
be adversely affected. We could also be required to restate financial statements for prior periods. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial
reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be
adversely affected and we could become subject to private litigation or to investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, all of which
could require our expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Those adverse consequences could be more severe if we are forced to effect any financial statement restatements.
*Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for
violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.*
Members of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited
circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its stockholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act
or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director's or officer's act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her
fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is
intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of
care by a director or officer.
Accordingly, stockholders may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition,
our bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with
us. This means that if one were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses our directors or
officers incur in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could
divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the prevailing market prices for our
common stock.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity risk may adversely impact our business. The impact could include weakened financial condition, litigation risk, degrading mining operations, loss of
competitiveness, fraud, extortion, harm to employees, violation of applicable privacy or other regulations that could result in regulatory action and fines.
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity program to manage the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and information systems that support
our business. The program is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and is integrated into our overall risk
management program. It is designed to develop appropriate strategies for preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and information systems
that can evolve with the changing cybersecurity threat landscape. We have implemented policies, procedures and technological tools to prevent, detect and mitigate
cybersecurity risks posed by third parties.
We use third party providers to help us consistently monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity program and performance through actions that include hiring a contract
Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO") with decades of cybersecurity experience to help manage our program. We also use industry standard technology tools
including vulnerability scans, penetration tests, firewalls, endpoint detection and threat intelligence. A written cybersecurity incident response plan that we tabletop
yearly and cybersecurity insurance are also important pillars in our approach to managing the risk of a cyber event. Our incident response plan contains a materiality
analysis framework based on Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199. This materiality framework allows us to identify and classify cybersecurity
events based on their impact to our data or information systems. This framework will assist us in expediting review of cyber events for materiality purposes that could
require disclosure to the SEC.
We have implemented a third party risk management policy that categorizes the cybersecurity risk posed by third party vendors along with the type of cybersecurity
controls we may require of those vendors. These may include employee training, cybersecurity tools like multi-factor authentication, and contractual requirements that
vendors maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical cybersecurity controls. This is in addition to the policies and practices we maintain to monitor access
of our information systems and data using our internal staff and third party vendors. As part of communicating the importance of cybersecurity at an enterprise wide
level, we require that all company employees participate in annual cybersecurity training.
Governance
Our IT Steering and Risk Committee ("ITSRC") has been delegated the responsibility for managing cybersecurity risk for the company. This committee is chaired by
our Chief Technology Officer and includes a diverse cross section of company stakeholders including the Senior IT Manager, General Counsel, VP of Organizational
Development and a member of our Third Party Audit team. As of July 1, 2024, we added an outsourced virtual CISO who is a key advisor to the ITSRC, specifically for
his decades of expertise in managing and maturing a cybersecurity program that includes mitigation, incident prevention, detection and remediation disciplines. The
ITSRC meets at least semi-annually to assess our approach to evolving cybersecurity threats and its impact on our cybersecurity program. The ITSRC is also responsible
for maintaining and monitoring legal and regulatory requirements and compliance as well as oversight of the adequacy of company cyber insurance. Our third party
security vendors, in collaboration with our Senior IT Manager, keep the ITSRC apprised of efforts surrounding the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of
any cyber threats or cybersecurity incidents.
The Board of Directors (the "Board") is entrusted with the oversight of the management of cybersecurity risk and our cybersecurity program. The Board administers this
oversight through its audit committee and the ITSRC. The ITSRC committee chair is responsible for reporting to the Board's audit committee with respect to
cybersecurity at least twice per calendar year. The audit committee, as necessary, reports any findings and recommendations to the Board. As cyber threats evolve and as
our cybersecurity program matures, the Board will consider further developing specific cybersecurity oversight functions and protocols.
For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters is located in Henderson, Nevada and is owned by us. In addition, we own and lease air-cooled bitcoin mining facilities in Georgia,
Mississippi and Tennessee. We own a property in College Park, Georgia that mines bitcoin through immersion technology and we own two parcels of land in Cheyenne,
Wyoming that are currently under construction to develop immersion, bitcoin mining facilities. The leases have expiration dates between July 2026 through June 2039.
We believe our existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business. Please refer to the discussions
contained in our Item 1. - "Business" for additional information.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
We are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We routinely are subject to
and resolve matters that do not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, our financial condition
and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.

Business Overview
We are a bitcoin mining company. We have no intention to mine, purchase or hold any other cryptocurrency at this time or in the foreseeable future, and we did not hold
any other cryptocurrency as of September 30, 2024. We independently own and operate a large portfolio of data centers across the United States with locations in
Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee for a total developed power capacity of approximately 552 MW as of September 30, 2024. We are currently finalizing the
developments of 75 MW in Wyoming and 16.5 MW in Mississippi. We have also had a hosting arrangement with GRIID Infrastructure, Inc. to host up to 54 MW of our
bitcoin miners in Tennessee, which hosting arrangement terminated when we closed on our acquisition of GRIID Infrastructure, Inc. on October 30, 2024, and the 54
MW continued as our owned and operated facilities. We have an independent data center operation in Massena, NY that hosts 50 MW for us, which agreement will
terminate on January 1, 2025.
We design our infrastructure to responsibly secure and support bitcoin, the world's most recognized digital commodity. We cultivate trust and transparency among our
employees, the communities we operate in and the people around the world who depend on bitcoin.

Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a
consensus-based network and a public ledger called a "blockchain," which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first
decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network
participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin.
Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the
appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work
consensus method, which entails solving cryptographic functions to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are
rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving for the cryptographic function and providing computing
power to the network.

Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important
roles in mining. As of September 30, 2024, our operating mining units were capable of producing over 27.6 EH/s of computing power. In bitcoin mining, "hashrate" is a
measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a computer processes transactions on the bitcoin network. We expect to continue increasing our
computing power through the end of 2024 and beyond as we expand our infrastructure at our owned sites in Wyoming, Tennessee, and Mississippi, seek strategic
acquisition targets, and through strategic co-location agreements. As of October 31, 2024, we are capable of producing 31.5 EH/s of computing power. A company's
computing power measured in hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies.

We owned approximately 235,000 miners as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 189,000 were in service and the remainder mainly pertains to new
machines ready to install in the expansion in Wyoming, Mississippi and Tennessee. These miners range in age from 1-45 months and have an average age of
approximately 12 months. Effective, May 2024, we estimate the useful lives of our miners to be 3-years (see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). We
do not have scheduled downtime for our miners. We periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, but such downtime has not historically been
significant. When performing unscheduled maintenance, we will typically replace the miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. The miners owned as of
September 30, 2024 have a range of energy efficiency (watts per terahash - "w/th") of 15.0 to 34 w/th with an average energy efficiency of 21.9 w/th.
We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell bitcoin from time to time to support our operations and strategic growth. We also will utilize our
bitcoin as collateral for lending arrangements. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin into U.S.
dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the
bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or
when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by
analyzing the need for working capital, forecasts and monitoring the market in real time.
The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. The following table provides a range of intraday low and intraday high bitcoin prices between October
1, 2021 through September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 6,819 bitcoins and had a receivable for 1,229 bitcoin that was posted as collateral and recorded on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as "Receivable for bitcoin collateral". The fair value of our bitcoin as of September 30, 2024 was $431,661 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
fair value of our Receivable for bitcoin collateral was $77,827. Effective October 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350-60 - Accounting
for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which requires bitcoin to be measured at fair value. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more details on
the impact of implementation to the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the carrying value of each bitcoin we held at October 1, 2023 and each subsequent
reporting period reflects the price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange, Coinbase, at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, decreases in the market price of
bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our bitcoin.

As of September 30, 2023, we held $0.05 in USD Coin ("USDC"), which is a digital currency that is fully backed by U.S. dollar assets, with the value of one USDC
coin pegged 1:1 to the value of one U.S. dollar. As of September 30, 2024, we did not hold any other cryptocurrency of value other than bitcoin.
We maintain real property holdings through our wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries.

Results of Operations
($ presented in 000's, except for per share amounts, bitcoin price and information set forth under the heading "Bitcoin Mining Operations")
Bitcoin Mining Operations
Overview
We operate a fleet of servers commonly known as miners or ASICS (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are computer chips customized for a specific use.
In the case of bitcoin mining, ASICs calculate the SHA-256 algorithm as efficiently and quickly as possible in order to compete with other miners to solve blocks. Each
calculation is a hash, and each machine's computational power is measured in terahash processed per second ("th/s"). One terahash is equal to 1 trillion hashes. The
more terahash we produce and contribute into the mining pool, the higher our percentage of the blockchain reward.
There are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitability. Our ability to mine profitability is dependent on successfully navigating these
fluctuating variables, which include bitcoin's value in USD (the volatility of which is described above), mining difficulty, block rewards and halving, global hashrate,
power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency and other factors.
The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the most significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We measure efficiency by the
watts of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners.
The table below describes our fleet as of September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing
power.

As of September 30, 2024, our operating hashrate was approximately 4.40% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the
global blockchain rewards, which as of that date equaled approximately 19-21 bitcoin per day, excluding the bitcoin earned from network transaction fees. Ultimately, in
order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining rewards cover our direct operating costs.

for valuing bitcoin transactions and use the closing price of bitcoin at 23:59:59 UTC as the source of recording revenue. See the table "Range of intraday bitcoin prices" for information on the range of
intraday bitcoin prices for quarterly periods between October 1, 2022 and September 30, 2024.
Power prices are the most significant cost driver for our wholly owned locations, and energy costs represented 39.7%, 51.5% and 19.6% as expressed as a percentage of
bitcoin mining revenues for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Energy prices can be highly volatile and global events (including the war in Ukraine and the resulting natural gas shortage) caused power prices to increase nationwide
in 2022. All of our wholly owned and operated sites in Georgia and Mississippi and our hosted miners in New York State are currently subject to variable prices and
market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power costs. Such prices are governed by power purchase agreements which vary by location, and said prices can
change hour to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with a
goal of increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather events, such as winter storms, polar vortices and hurricanes,
which increase the demand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates. The average power
prices we paid in our owned facilities for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $0.046, $0.048 and $0.041 per KWH, respectively.
The management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail our operations. We curtail when power prices exceed the
value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin's value decreases or energy prices increase, our curtailment will increase;
likewise, when bitcoin's value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this decision on an hour-by-hour
basis across all our sites, both wholly owned and hosted. The Company did not have significant curtailment greater than 20% during the years ended September 30,
2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company records depreciation expense (a non-cash expense) on its miners on a straight-line basis over the miners' expected useful life. Such non-cash depreciation
amounts are recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as "Depreciation and Amortization". Although the Company
recognizes depreciation with respect to its mining assets, it does not consider depreciation in determining whether it is economical to operate its mining equipment since
depreciation expense is not an avoidable operating cost, such as energy costs. The table above presents the non-cash miner depreciation expense on a "per bitcoin" basis,
calculated by dividing miner depreciation expense in our owned facilities by the number of bitcoin mined in the owned facilities. On a "cost per bitcoin" ratio, miner
depreciation expense was $17,156, $8,208 and $11,630 for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recorded accelerated
depreciation on certain of its miners based on the reduction of the estimated useful life from 5 years to 3 years, which equaled $1,170 on a cost per bitcoin ratio for the
year ended September 30, 2024. In fiscal 2023, the accelerated depreciation was applicable to certain miners removed from service prior to the conclusion of their
originally estimated useful life. The number of bitcoin received by the Company was reduced by approximately 50% effective April 19, 2024 when the bitcoin algorithm
halved the rewards from 6.25 per block to 3.125 per block.
We have financing costs for a limited number of miners in our miner fleet and such costs are recorded within Interest Expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The table above presents financing costs per bitcoin calculated by dividing direct interest expense on our miner financing
agreement by the number of bitcoin mined in our owned facilities. On a cost per bitcoin ratio, financing costs were $209, $411 and $508 for the years ended September
30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(1) Average revenue of each bitcoin mined is calculated I by dividing the sum of bitcoin mining revenue for hosted facilities by the total number of bitcoin mined within the hosted facilities during the
respective periods. We have determined that Coinbase is the principal market for valuing bitcoin transactions and use the closing prices as of 23:59:59 UTC as the source of recording revenue. See the
table "Range of intraday bitcoin prices" for information on the range of intraday bitcoin prices for quarterly periods between October 1, 2022 and September 30, 2024.

For our hosted facilities, hosting fees (which comprise direct operating costs of the third-party operator with energy as the largest cost) and profit sharing were a
combined 71.5%, 66.9% and 42.4% as a percentage of bitcoin mining revenues for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

At our hosted facilities, the hosting fee as compared to KWHs utilized in the hosted facilities was $0.067, $0.064 and $0.098 per KWH for the years ended September
30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We did not have significant curtailment greater than 20% during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

On a "cost per bitcoin" ratio, miner depreciation expense was $22,374, $14,872 and $8,958 for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The
increase for the fiscal year 2024 period was mainly due to the decrease of bitcoin production as a result of the bitcoin halving on April 19, 2024 when the bitcoin
algorithm halved rewards from 6.25 per block to 3.125 per block. The Company did not have any S19 XP or S21 miners at the hosted facilities during the periods
presented and accordingly, there was no accelerated depreciation in the hosted facilities in fiscal 2024 following the reduction in the estimated useful life of our miners
from 5 years to 3 years. In fiscal 2023, the accelerated depreciation was applicable to certain miners removed from service prior to the conclusion of their originally
estimated useful life.

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
Bitcoin mining revenue
We earned $378,968 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2024, which was an increase of $210,847, or 125%, as compared with $168,121 in revenues for
the year ended September 30, 2023. Bitcoin mining revenues are recorded net of bitcoin mining fees charged by our sole mining pool operator that equaled
approximately 0.16% and 0.09% of gross bitcoin mining revenues for the year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are determined by two main
drivers: quantity of bitcoin mined and the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we mined 7,092 bitcoins, net of mining pool fees, with an average bitcoin price of $53,435 as compared to 6,903
bitcoins with an average bitcoin price of $24,355 during the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in bitcoin mining revenue was primarily due to increase in the
average bitcoin price and the increase in bitcoin mined year over year. The increase in the quantity of bitcoin mined was primarily driven by the increased number of
miners in operation which more than doubled to approximately 188,500 as of September 30, 2024 from 88,000 as of September 30, 2023. This increase in miners in
operation increased our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin
we are able to mine.
Other services revenues
Other services revenues pertain to our data center operations which ceased operations as of September 30, 2023 due to management's decision to divert all capacity
within its operations to bitcoin mining. The Company earned $287 from its data center operations during the year ended September 30, 2023.
Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)
Our cost of revenues were $165,516 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $71,936, or 77%, as compared with cost of revenues of $93,580 for the year
ended September 30, 2023. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate miners within our owned facilities, which was $132,192 for the year ended
September 30, 2024, an increase of $69,763 as compared to $65,824 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increases in energy costs was primarily due to the
increase in the volume of miners operating in our owned locations partially offset by the reduction in the average cost per KWHs, which approximated $0.046/KWH for
the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an average cost of $0.048/KWH for the year ended September 30, 2023. We continually evaluate energy and bitcoin
prices and periodically will curtail our mining operations when it is advantageous to do so.
We also incurred hosting fees of $27,961 and profit sharing fees of $4,784 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $4,987 and $793, respectively, as
compared to $22,974 and $3,991, respectively for the year ended September 30, 2023. The hosting fees and profit-sharing fees were primarily the result of our co-
location agreements with Coinmint and GRIID. The hosting fees increased primarily due to increases in utility rates partially offset by a slight reduction in KWHs
utilized.
Professional fees
Professional fees, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $13,806 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2,937, or 27%,
from $10,869 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Legal expenses were $5,707 for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $7,676 in the prior year. This
decrease was primarily attributable to no legal settlements during the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3,800 of legal settlements in the prior year. Other
professional fees, namely accounting, audit and consulting, were $8,099 for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $3,193 for the year ended September 30,
2023, representing an increase of $4,906.

Payroll expenses

Payroll expenses increased to $74,095 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from $45,714 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our payroll expenses
include all compensation related expenses for our employees, primarily consisting of salaries, wages, payroll-related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based
compensation. Payroll expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, were $44,540 the year ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 106%
from $21,572 in the prior year ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the significant growth in locations, increase in employee headcount along
with employee bonuses during the year.
We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll-related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was
$29,555 for the year ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $5,413, or 22%, from $24,142 the prior year ended September 30, 2023. Such increase was primarily due
to the vesting of market-based restricted stock awards in March due to achieving the market-based targets.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative fees increased to $30,185 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from $20,823 for the same period ended September 30, 2023, representing
an increase of $9,362. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate overhead, including, but not limited to, taxes and licenses, insurance premiums,
travel expenses and rent expenses.
Gain (loss) on fair value of bitcoin, net

Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $113,423. As discussed in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6
- Bitcoin, the Company adopted the amendments per ASC 350-60 in the current period; accordingly, we measured crypto assets within the scope of ASC Topic 350-60 -
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement and included the gains and losses from
remeasurement in net income (loss). The gain pertains to the change in bitcoin's fair value from $26,961 per bitcoin on October 1, 2023 to $63,301 per bitcoin on
September 30, 2024.

Prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60 - Crypto Assets, bitcoin was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and was measured at cost less impairment. Additionally,
in the previous guidance, subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is
recognized. Accordingly, gains (losses) recognized on fair value of bitcoin in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin)

Impairment expense in the amount of $7,163 was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2023. There was no impairment expense related to bitcoin for the year
ended September 30, 2024 due to the adoption of ASC 350-60 (as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Bitcoin) which
resulted in measuring bitcoin at fair value and recognizing gains or losses from remeasurement of the assets rather than at cost less impairment. The prior year
impairment expense consisted of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year. Decreases in bitcoin prices for periods subsequent to
the mining date were recorded as impairment expense. Under ASC Topic 350 - Goodwill and Other (prior guidance), subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not
allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized.

Realized gain on sale of bitcoin

Realized gain on sale of bitcoin was $1,357 for the year ended September 30, 2023. As described under the heading "Gain (loss) on fair value of bitcoin, net" above,
gains (losses) recognized on bitcoin transactions in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

Impairment Expense - Fixed Assets
Effective April 30, 2024, we concluded that various miner models (S19J, S19 J Pro and S19 J Pro+) would begin to be phased out and removed from service and
replaced with newer, more efficient miner models. We began removing these miners in the periods subsequent to April 30,2024 and expect to have these miners
removed from service by December 2024. Based on this operational change we recorded an impairment charge of $189,235 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The
impairment charge was calculated by comparing the carrying amount as of April 30, 2024 to the fair value, which included the residual value of the miners. Due to
subsequent reductions in salvage value between June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we further reduced the estimated salvage value of these miners removed from
service and recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $7,806.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $154,609 for the year ended September 30, 2024 from $120,728 for the same period ended September 30, 2023, an
increase of $33,881.
Depreciation expense increased by $33,854, or 29%, during the year ended September 30, 2024, to $152,469 from $118,615 for the year ended September 30, 2023, due
to an increase in miners and mining-related equipment being placed in service during the comparative period and due to accelerated depreciation expense on miners
beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Additionally, the Company reduced the expected useful life for miners from 5 years for new miners to 3 years, effective
May 1, 2024.
Amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $2,140, an increase of $27, or 1%, from $2,113 for the prior year ended September 30, 2023.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other Income was $6,610 for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared with other expenses of $260 for the year ended September 30, 2023, which is a change of
$6,870. The fluctuation was primarily related to the interest income earned in the year ended September 30, 2024 of $8,555 as compared to $481 in the prior year ended
September 30, 2023 due to a higher balance of cash retained in short term interest bearing accounts and the interest earned on the note receivable from GRIID (See Note
7 - Note Receivable from GRIID).
Interest expense in the year ended September 30, 2024 was $2,455 a decrease of $523 from $2,977 in the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily
related to overall reduction in loan balances. Additionally, we recognized a gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2,484 for the year ended
September 30, 2023 relating to the Mawson acquisition. Unrealized loss on derivative security of $965 was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to loss for the same prior year period of $259, this change between the periods was the result of a change in fair value of the underlying instrument.
Net Loss from Continuing Operations
Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $145,777 as compared to net loss of $133,719 for the year ended September 30, 2023 for
the reasons discussed above.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $145,777, an increase of $7,628 compared to a net loss of $138,148 for the year ended September 30, 2023.

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022
Bitcoin mining revenue
We earned $168,121 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of $37,121, or 28%, as compared with $131,000 in revenues for the
year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to increase in revenues from our bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin mining revenues are determined by two main drivers:
quantity of bitcoin mined and the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we mined 6,903 bitcoins with an
average bitcoin price of $24,355 as compared to 3,752 bitcoins with an average bitcoin price of $34,916 during the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in the
quantity of bitcoin mined was primarily driven by the increased number of miners in operation which almost doubled to approximately 88,000 as of September 30, 2023
from 47,000 as of September 30, 2022. This increase in miners in operation increased our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood
in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin we are able to mine.
Other services revenues
Other services revenues pertain to our data center operations for which we earned $287 in revenue from our data center operation for the year ended September 30, 2023,
which is a decrease of $238, or 45%, as compared to $525 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was due to management's decision to divert all capacity
within its operations to bitcoin mining. As of September 30, 2023, we no longer recognize revenues from data center operations.
Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)
Our cost of revenues were $93,580 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $52,346, or 127%, as compared with cost of revenues of $41,234 for the year
ended September 30, 2022. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate the mining equipment within our owned facilities, which was $65,824 for the
year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $52,490 as compared to $13,334 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in energy costs within our owned
facilities relates to the full-year or approximate full-year, as applicable, of mining operations in fiscal year 2023 in our Washington and Sandersville locations which
were acquired in August 2022 and October 2022, respectively.
We also incurred hosting fees of $22,974 and profit-sharing fees of $3,991 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $266 and a decrease of $37,
respectively, as compared to $22,708 and $4,028, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2022. The hosting fees and profit-sharing fees were primarily the result
of our co-location agreement with Coinmint. The hosting fees remained consistent for both fiscal years since the increase in KWHs utilized was offset by the decrease in
the rate charged per KWH.
Professional fees
Professional fees, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $10,869 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $4,400, or 68%,
from $6,469 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Legal expenses were $7,676 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $2,714 in the prior year. This
increase was primarily attributable to $3,800 in litigation settlement with Darfon America Corp. and additional activity in litigation and transactional costs. Other
professional fees, namely accounting, audit and consulting, were $3,193 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $3,755 for the year ended September 30,
2022, a decrease of $562.

Payroll expenses

Payroll expenses increased to $45,714 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $40,920 for the same period ended September 30, 2022. Our payroll expenses
include all compensation related expenses for our employees, consisting primarily of salaries, wages, payroll-related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based
compensation. Payroll expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, were $21,572 the year ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 127%
from $9,493 in the prior year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Company's acquisition of both WAHA and Mawson in August 2022 and
October 2022, respectively.
We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll-related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was
$24,142 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $7,324, or 23%, from $31,466 the prior year ended September 30, 2022.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative fees increased to $20,823 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $10,423 for the same period ended September 30, 2022, representing
an increase of $10,400. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate overhead, including, but not limited to, taxes and licenses, insurance premiums,
travel expenses and rent expenses.
Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin)
Impairment expense in the amount of $7,163 was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $5,047 as compared to $12,210 for the year ended
September 30, 2022. The impairment expense consists of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year, for which there was a larger
general decrease in bitcoin prices during fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Decreases in bitcoin prices for
periods subsequent to the mining date are recorded as impairment expense. Impairment expense was measured utilizing the intraday low bitcoin price during the holding
period of bitcoin. ASC Topic 350-Goodwill and Other that requires subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the
bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. As described above, the Company adopted ASC 350-60 - Crypto Assets on October 1, 2023.
Realized gain on sale of bitcoin
Realized gain on sale of bitcoin decreased to $1,357 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from a realized gain of $2,567 for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Realized gain on sale of bitcoin is the difference between the sales proceeds of bitcoin and the carrying amount. Typically, gains are higher when bitcoin prices are
increasing over a holding period.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $120,728 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $49,045 for the same period ended September 30, 2022, an
increase of $71,683.
Depreciation expense increased by $71,533, or 152%, during the year ended September 30, 2023, to $118,615 from $47,082, due to an increase in miners and mining-
related equipment being placed in service during the comparative period. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company purchased Antminer XPs
(140 th/s with 21.5 J/TH), and replaced certain less efficient miners with these newly acquired miners. As a result, the Company recognized an additional $32,721 in
accelerated depreciation expense on the replaced miners.
Amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $2,113, an increase of $150, or 8%, from $1,963 for the prior year ended September 30, 2022.

Other Income (Expenses)
Other expense was $260 for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with other expense of $2,225 for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is a variance of
$1,965. We recognized a gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2,484 for the year ended September 30, 2023 relating to the Mawson
acquisition. Unrealized loss on derivative security of $259 was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to loss for the same prior year period of
$1,950.
Interest expense in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 increased by $1,899 to $2,977 from $1,078 in the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily
related to the Financing Agreement, which was entered into in April 2022 and was outstanding for approximately five months in the fiscal year ended September 30,
2022 as compared to being outstanding during the entire fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.
Net Loss from Continuing Operations
Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $133,719 as compared to net loss of $40,089 for the year ended September 30, 2022 for
the reasons discussed above.
Results of Discontinued Operations
Revenues from our former energy segment decreased year over year as expected to $158 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $9,667 for the year ended
September 30, 2022. The total costs and expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased to $6,071 from $26,901 for the year ended September 30, 2022
primarily due to impairment expenses related to the energy business and severance-related payroll expenses recognized in the prior year. As a result, the net loss from
discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased to $4,429 from $17,237 in the prior year ended September 30, 2022. The Company does not
expect any substantial activity to be recorded to discontinued operations in subsequent periods.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $138,148, an increase of $80,822 compared to a net loss of $57,326 for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Non-GAAP Measure
We present adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Our
non-GAAP "Adjusted EBITDA" excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on
securities, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration with respect to previously completed acquisitions, all of which are non-cash items that we believe are
not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in
comparison to other companies; (iii) non-cash impairment losses related to long-lived assets; (iv) realized gains and losses on sales of equity securities, the amounts of
which are directly related to the unrealized gains and losses that are also excluded; (v) legal fees related to litigation and various transactions, which fees management
does not believe are reflective of our ongoing operating activities; (vi) gains and losses on disposal of assets, the majority of which are related to obsolete or unrepairable
machines that are no longer deployed; (vii) gains and losses related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities; and (viii)
severance expenses.
We previously excluded non-cash impairment losses related to bitcoin and realized gains and losses on sales of bitcoin from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA but
have determined such items are part of our normal ongoing operations and will no longer be excluding them from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA.

Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these items allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core
business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for
evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management
believes that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management
believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management
does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate our bitcoin related revenues). For example, we expect that share-based
compensation expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of
the compensation provided to certain employees, officers and directors. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary
to generate our bitcoin-related revenue.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our
industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and
should not be considered as an alternative to operating (loss) income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management
utilizes internally and presents adjusted EBITDA, we only utilize that measure supplementally and do not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the
information provided by GAAP financial results.
Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our Consolidated
Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net (loss) income) for the periods indicated:

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, loan payments, public company costs and general corporate needs. We
expect these needs to continue as we further develop and grow our business. For the year ended September 30, 2024, our primary sources of liquidity came from
existing cash and cash equivalents, bitcoin and proceeds from our at-the-market ("ATM") equity offering program.

Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin, together with cash generated from operations, will be
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future until we reach profitability, and we are not aware
of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the liquidity of our assets. We may continue utilizing
the ATM program to strategically issue shares of common stock to support our liquidity needs, and we may amend or replace the program as necessary to maintain this
funding flexibility. We are likely to require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, business opportunities,
challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit
facilities for other reasons. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or
support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In particular, rising inflation and changes in interest rates, and the conflict
between Russia and Ukraine, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing our ability to
access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

As of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of $705,430, primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents, bitcoin, receivable from bitcoin collateral, the note
receivable from GRIID, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $1,962,662. Our total current liabilities and total liabilities as of
September 30, 2024 were $187,887 and $201,821, respectively. We had a working capital of $517,543 as of September 30, 2024. The Company had issued all of the
ATM's remaining capacity through the date of these consolidated financial statements. Consistent with past activity, management maintains various sources of funding
available for the Company's future needs.

## Material Cash Requirements

We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term
liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are
considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services,
primarily miners and equipment, entered into in the normal course of business, loans and both finance and operating leases.

We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business, including through potential acquisitions of businesses or assets. We will evaluate a variety of sources of
capital in connection with financing any future possible acquisitions, including the incurrence of debt, sales of stock or bitcoin, or using cash on hand. We may also use
the Company's stock as transaction consideration, as we have done in the past.

For information regarding our contractual obligations, refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies included elsewhere in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

## Operating Activities from Continuing Operations

The Company generates non-cash revenue through mining Bitcoin, which it retains based on its long-term value strategy, while funding all operating expenses with
cash. As a result, net cash used in operating activities was $233,154 for the year ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to net loss of $145,777, adjusted by adding
non-cash adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash of impairment of goodwill, fixed assets and other of $197,757, depreciation and amortization of $154,609, stock
based compensation of $29,555 and loss on disposal of assets of $5,466 and subtracting non-cash bitcoin mining revenues of $378,968, gain on fair value of bitcoin, net
of $113,423 and gain on fair value of receivable for bitcoin collateral of $1,384. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generated a net total of $16,529 of cash.

Net cash used in operating activities was $18,573 for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to net loss of $138,148, adjusted by adding non-cash adjustment
to reconcile net loss to net cash of depreciation and amortization of $120,728, stock based compensation of $24,142, impairment of bitcoin of $7,163 and loss on disposal
of assets of $1,931 and subtracting non-cash bitcoin mining revenues of $168,121. We also generated cash proceeds from selling bitcoin of $116,271. Changes in
operating assets and liabilities generated a net total of $15,232 of cash.

## Investing Activities from Continuing Operations

Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2024 was $920,398 as compared with $334,179 for the year ended September 30, 2023. Our
payments on miner equipment purchase and deposits of $740,296, purchase of fixed assets of $66,100, the combined asset purchases of land and locations of $97,647,
and the note receivable from GRIID in the amount of $60,919 were the main cash outflows. The Company generated $43,126 of cash flows from the sales of bitcoin
during the year ended September 30, 2024.

Our purchase of fixed assets of $61,460, payments on mining equipment (including deposits) of $239,416 and purchase of Mawson for $22,518, and the acquisition of
Coinmaker LLC for $9,389 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2023.

## Financing Activities from Continuing Operations

Cash flows generated by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $1,249,123, as compared with $357,928 for the year ended
September 30, 2023. Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from our at-the-market offering
facility of $1,231,834 (106,969,819 shares at a weighted average price of $11.43 per share and $9,590 collections from receivable from equity offerings) and
borrowings under our credit facility with Coinbase of $50,000. Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 consisted of $376,200 in
proceeds from offerings (98,829,525 shares at a weighted average price of $3.88 per share less 7,576 net collections on receivable for equity offerings) partially offset
by payments on loans of $14,466.

## Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations

Cash used in discontinued operations of $508 for the year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily based on the winding down of operations, which includes payments
on warranty service. In the year ended September 30, 2023, operating cash flows generated was $1,326 mainly due to payments received from accounts receivable,
payments made on accounts payable and cash generated from the sale of assets during the fiscal year.

Compensation Recovery Analysis

As a result of our correction of errors in the prior year financial statements, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, consisting entirely of independent
directors, conducted a recovery analysis of incentive-based compensation received by our executive officers during the relevant period, as contemplated by Rule 10D-1
under the Exchange Act and in accordance with our Executive Officer Incentive Compensation Recoupment (Clawback) Policy. Based on this analysis, no recovery of
incentive-based compensation is required, as the financial statement adjustments did not impact the metrics used to determine incentive compensation during the relevant
recovery period, and thus there was no erroneously awarded compensation.

Recently Issued and Proposed Accounting Pronouncements

For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2 - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We
have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our
financial condition and results of operations. These policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period
due to the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments,
assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments
required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions.

The most significant accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.

Revenue Recognition

We participate in a third-party operated mining pool. As a participant in this mining pool, we provide a service to perform hash calculations which is an output of our
ordinary activities. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (ASC 606). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We receive non-cash
consideration in the form of bitcoin, fair value of which we measure at 23:59:59 UTC on the date of contract inception using our principal market for bitcoin. The
contract renews continuously throughout the day, and thus the value of the consideration should be assessed continuously throughout the day. Our critical policy is that
we have concluded to use the 23:59:59 UTC bitcoin price each day. The market price of bitcoin fluctuates throughout the day, and the revenue recognized on a daily
basis could be impacted if we utilized a different point in time or average price to recognize revenue. The Company assesses whether measuring the fair value of bitcoin
received at 23:59:59 on the date of contract inception materially differs from assessing the fair value of bitcoin received continuously throughout the day at contract
inception.

Impairment of long-lived assets

We evaluate impairment of long-lived assets when events or circumstance indicates there is a potential for impairment. The evaluation of impairment involves the
conclusion that an indicator of impairment has occurred, the determination of the recoverability of long-lived assets from the results of operations and, if necessary, the
fair value of the potentially impaired long-lived assets. The determination of fair value, specifically for our miners, includes estimates such as future bitcoin prices,
transaction fees, and the future global hashrate. Actual future outcomes could result in different conclusions that could materially affect the consolidated financial
statements.

58

# Page 59 of 134

The most significant accounting estimates in the preparation of our financial statements include estimate of useful lives of our miners, and impairment of long-lived
assets and the valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets.

*Useful lives of miners*

We establish the useful lives of miners based upon the period over which they provide economic benefit to the Company in the form of bitcoin mining revenue and the
duration of miner technological capability. Changes in the profitability of mining operations or miner technological capability could affect the determination of useful
lives and have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

*Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets*

Accounting for income taxes requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on
the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. The guidance requires the reduction of deferred
tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. To fully utilize the net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward, we will need to generate sufficient
future taxable income in each respective jurisdiction. Due primarily to our history of losses, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets as of
September 30, 2024 will not be realized. Future estimates of taxable income could have a material impact our utilization of our NOL's.

**Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

The following discussion about the Company's market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in
the forward-looking statements.

*Market Price Risk of Bitcoin.* The Company holds a significant amount of bitcoin; therefore, we are exposed to the impact of market price changes in bitcoin on its
bitcoin holdings. This exposure would generally manifest itself in the following areas:

•The Company accounts for its bitcoin holdings at fair value and records changes in fair value throughout the periods being reported.

•Declines in the fair market value of bitcoin will impact the cash value that would be realized if the Company were to sell its bitcoin for cash, therefore having a
negative impact on its liquidity.

At September 30, 2024, the Company held 6,819 bitcoins and the fair value of a single bitcoin was approximately $63,301, meaning that the fair value of its bitcoin
holdings on that date was approximately $432,000. A 10% increase or decrease in the fair value of bitcoin as of September 30, 2024, would have increased or decreased
the total cash value that could be realized if the Company were to sell its bitcoin for cash by approximately $43,200.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Shareholders and Board of Directors
CleanSpark, Inc.
Las Vegas, Nevada
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CleanSpark, Inc. (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index. (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended
September 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and our report dated December 3, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB")
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PСАОВ.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit
matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

# Bitcoin Mining Revenue
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company participates in a third-party operated mining pool (the "mining pool") by providing
hashrate to the mining pool operator. The Company recognizes bitcoin mining revenue as it fulfills its performance obligation over time by providing hashrate. Once the
hashrate is provided, the Company earns non-cash consideration in the form of bitcoin based on the Full-Pay-Per-Share ("FPPS") payout method set forth by the mining
pool operator. Bitcoin mining revenue is comprised of the block reward and transaction fees earned by the Company net of the mining pool fees charged by the mining
pool operator. For the year ended September 30, 2024, bitcoin mining revenue, net ("mining revenue") was approximately $379 million.

We identified the auditing of mining revenue as a critical audit matter due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to perform audit procedures over the
Company's hashrate provided to the mining pool operator and the associated contractual payouts based on the blockchain contractual inputs.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

• With the assistance of our Information Technology ("IT") professionals, we identified the key system used to monitor hashrate and tested the IT general controls
over the system.
• We confirmed with the mining pool operator (i) the contractual terms used in the determination of mining revenue, (ii) hashrate provided to the mining pool
operator by the Company, (iii) total mining revenue earned by the Company, and (iv) the Company's digital asset wallet addresses in which the mining revenue is
deposited.
• Using the Company's digital asset wallet addresses confirmed by the mining pool operator, we reconciled the mining revenue earned from and paid by the
mining pool operator against on-chain transactions independently obtained from the blockchain.
• Using data analytics, we recalculated the Company's recorded mining revenue per the calculation prescribed in the FPPS payout method using independently
obtained blockchain contractual inputs, the hashrate confirmed by the mining pool operator, and independent bitcoin prices.
• For the mining revenue generated through the Company's owned facilities, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the hashrate provided to the mining pool
operator by comparing it against the system used by the Company to monitor hashrate.
• For the mining revenue generated through colocation facilities, we performed analytical procedures to predict the hashrate provided to the mining pool operator
and the mining revenue earned and recorded by the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Shareholders and Board of Directors
CleanSpark, Inc.
Las Vegas, Nevada
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited CleanSpark, Inc.'s (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO criteria"). In our opinion, the
Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of
management's assessment.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year
ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as "the financial
statements") and our report dated December 3, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Item 9A, Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting". Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses regarding
management's failure to design and maintain controls over (1) program change management, logical access and maintaining appropriate segregation of duties within the
general ledger system, and as a result, the internal controls related to various assertions in certain financial statement line items were not effective, (2) the accounting for
property plant and equipment, and deposits on miners, (3) controls over payroll, including controls over the use of information from its third-party payroll service
provider, maintaining appropriate segregation of duties and processing of payroll, (4) the safeguarding of cash have been identified and described in management's
assessment. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated December 3, 2024 on those consolidated financial statements.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used to review
the Company's goodwill impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-
for-sale investments, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Revenue from Bitcoin Mining
The Company participates in a third-party operated mining pool. As a participant in the third-party operated mining pool, the Company provides a service to perform
hash calculations for the third-party operated mining pool, which is an output of our ordinary activities. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a
company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
1.Identify the contract with the customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation
Step 1: The Company has identified the third-party mining pool operator as its customer (the "Customer"). The Company enters into a contract with the Customer to
provide its hash calculations to the Customer's mining pool. The contracts are terminable without penalty at any time by either party, and thus the contract term is shorter
than a 24-hour period and the contracts are continuously renewed.
Applying the criteria per ASC 606-10-25-1, the contract arises at the point that the Company provides hash calculations to the Customer's mining pool, which is
considered contract inception, because Customer consumption is in tandem with delivery of the hash calculations.
Step 2: In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify
each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a "distinct" good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if
both of the following criteria are met:
•The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or
service is capable of being distinct); and
•The entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the
good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
Based on these criteria, the Company has identified a single performance obligation of providing hash calculations for the mining pool operator. The continuous renewal
options do not represent material rights because they do not provide the Customer with the right to purchase additional goods or services at a discount. Specifically, the
contract is renewed at the same terms, conditions, and rate as the current contract which is consistent with market rates, and there are no up front or incremental fees in
the initial contract. The Company has full control of the mining equipment used in the mining pool, and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the
hashrate calculations of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive), the hashrate provided to the Customer will correspondingly
increase or decrease.

Step 3: The Company receives non-cash consideration in the form of bitcoin, fair value of which the Company measures at 23:59:59 UTC on the date of contract
inception using the Company's principal market for bitcoin, Coinbase. The contract renews continuously throughout the day, and thus the value of the consideration
should be assessed continuously throughout the day, and the Company has concluded to use the 23:59:59 UTC bitcoin price each day. According to the Customer
contract, daily settlements are made to the Company by the Customer based on the hash calculations provided over the contract periods occurring over a 24 hour period
and the payout is made the following day. There are no other forms of variable considerations, such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives,
performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items.
The Company earns non-cash consideration based on the Full-Pay-Per-Share ("FPPS") payout method set forth by the Customer in the form of bitcoin. The amount of
bitcoin the Company is entitled to for providing hash calculations to the Customer's mining pool under the FPPS payout method is made up of block rewards and
transaction fees less mining pool fees determined as follows:
•The non-cash consideration calculated as a block reward over the continuously renewed contract periods is based on the total blocks expected to be generated on
the Bitcoin Network for the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: the hash
calculations that the Company provides to the Customer as a percent of the Bitcoin Network's implied hash calculations as determined by the network difficulty,
multiplied by the total Bitcoin Network block rewards expected to be generated for the same period.
•The non-cash consideration calculated as transaction fees paid by transaction requestors is based on the share of total actual fees paid over the continuously
renewed contract periods beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: total actual transaction fees generated on
the Bitcoin Network during the contract period as a percent of total block rewards the Bitcoin Network actually generated during the same period, multiplied by
the block rewards the Company earned for the same period noted above.
• The sum of the block reward and transaction fees earned by the Company is reduced by mining pool fees charged by the Customer for operating the mining pool
based on a rate schedule per the mining pool contract. The mining pool fee is only incurred to the extent the Company performs hash calculations and generates
revenue in accordance with the Customer's payout formula during the continuously renewed contract periods beginning mid-night UTC and ending 23:59:59
UTC daily. The Customer provides services solely for bitcoin mining and the fees charged during the most recent fiscal year end were 0.16% of the total daily
bitcoin mined. This amount represents consideration paid to the Customer and is thus reported as a reduction in revenue as the Company does not receive a
distinct good or service from the mining pool operator in exchange.
Step 4: There is a single performance obligation (i.e., to provide hash calculations or hashrate to the customer) for the contract; therefore, all consideration from the
Customer is allocated to this single performance obligation.
Step 5: The Company's performance is completed over time as the customer obtains control of the contributed hashrate. The performance obligation of hash calculations
is fulfilled over time, as opposed to a point in time, because the Company provides the hash calculations throughout the contract period and the customer simultaneously
obtains control of the service and uses it to produce bitcoin.
There are no deferred revenues or other liability obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance, and there are no
remaining performance obligations after providing hash calculations.
Revenues from Data Center Services
Effective as of September 30, 2023, data center services are no longer provided to external customers. The Company formerly provided data services, such as providing
its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services, such as virtual services, virtual storage and data backup services, generally based on monthly
services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations were the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract.
The transaction price was the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered
for the month.
F-18

# Page 79 of 134

The total revenue recognized from data center services included as *Other services revenue* in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the
years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $0, $287 and $525, respectively.

**Cost of Revenues**
The Company includes energy costs and external co-location mining hosting fees in cost of revenues.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. These investments may include
money market funds, certificates of deposit, and other short-term instruments. Temporary cash investments are made with high credit quality financial institutions. At
times, such investments in U.S. accounts may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limits.

**Restricted cash**
The Company considers cash to be restricted when held in a separate bank account and withdrawal and general use is restricted legally or to restrict a portion cash as
collateral for insurance carriers. The Company had restricted cash of $3,056 and $0 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and held in a deposit account that
accrues interest. Amounts included in restricted cash represent those required to be set aside by contractual agreements with insurance carriers in relation to utility bonds
for various utility companies.

**Prepaid expense and other current assets**
The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term pre-
paid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long-term assets.

**Bitcoin**
Bitcoin are included in current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the Company's ability to sell bitcoin in a highly liquid marketplace, and such bitcoin
holdings are expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Company.

As a result of adopting ASC 350-60, *Intangibles — Goodwill and Other*, ("ASC 350-60") on October 1, 2023, bitcoin is measured at fair value as of each reporting
period (see "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below"). The fair value of bitcoin is measured using the period-end closing bitcoin price from its principal
market, Coinbase, in accordance with ASC 820, *Fair Value Measurement* ("ASC 820"). Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of
23:59:59 UTC, which aligns with the Company's revenue recognition cut-off. The changes in bitcoin valuation due to remeasurement in fair value within each reporting
period are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as *"Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net"*. In accordance with ASC 350-60, the
Company discloses realized gains and losses from the sale of bitcoin and such gains and losses are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the cost
basis of bitcoin as determined on a First In-First Out basis.

# Page 80 of 134

Prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60, bitcoin was recorded at cost less impairment and was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350,
*Intangibles — Goodwill and Other* ("ASC 350"). Bitcoin was accounted for in connection with the Company's revenue recognition policy detailed above. An intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life was not amortized but was assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occurred
indicating that it was more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset was impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for
impairment for periods under the prior accounting guidance, the Company had the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more
likely than not that an impairment exists. If it was determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test was not
necessary. If the Company concluded otherwise, it was required to perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company elected to perform the quantitative impairment
test each period rather than first performing the qualitative assessment. Quantitative impairment was measured using the intraday low bitcoin price from its principal
market for bitcoin in accordance with ASC 820. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal
of impairment losses was not permitted as per ASC 350.

Bitcoin, which is non-cash consideration earned by the Company through its mining activities, is included as a reconciling item as a cash outflow within operating
activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The cash proceeds from the sales of bitcoin are classified based on the holding period in which
the bitcoin is held. ASC 350-60 provides guidance on classifying proceeds from bitcoin and concludes that bitcoin converted nearly immediately into cash would qualify
as cash flows from operating activities. All other sales would qualify as investing activities. The Company did not hold its bitcoin for extended periods of time, and such
sales proceeds prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60 were reported as cash flows from operating activities. Upon adoption of ASC 350-60, the Company evaluates its
sales of bitcoin and records bitcoin sold nearly immediately as operating cash flows and the remainder is recorded as investing activities. During fiscal year 2024, all
proceeds from bitcoin sales were classified as investing activities.

**Receivable for bitcoin collateral**

The Receivable for bitcoin collateral represents the bitcoin posted as collateral to lenders who have rights to sell, pledge and re-hypothecate such bitcoin at their sole
discretion and for which the lenders have an obligation to return to the Company at the maturity of the loan. The receivable is recorded at fair value and changes in fair
value are recorded as "Change in fair value of bitcoin collateral". The receivable for bitcoin collateral is classified as current. Realized gains on fair value of bitcoin
collateral represent the difference between the fair value on the date the bitcoin was posted as collateral and the fair value on the date the bitcoin is returned to the
Company. The value and activity involving this asset is discussed in detail alongside the Coinbase line of credit in Note 12 - Loans.

At commencement and throughout the term of the arrangement, the Company considers and accounts for the credit risk associated with the bitcoin receivable collateral
in accordance with the principles outlined in ASC 326, *Financial Instruments - Credit Losses* ("ASC 326"). The Receivable for bitcoin collateral is presented net of any
allowance for credit losses.

In estimating the allowance for credit losses, the Company applies the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model, which requires the measurement of lifetime
expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. As the Company has no historical experience with similar assets, the allowance is determined
using a combination of industry data, peer analysis, and forward-looking information about economic conditions and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The
Company incorporates relevant qualitative factors, such as the nature of the receivable, the characteristics of the counterparty, and any observable market indicators, to
assess the expected collectability of the Receivable for bitcoin collateral. The estimation process also includes reasonable and supportable forecasts to account for future
economic conditions and any anticipated impact on the receivable. For the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, no amount of allowances for credit
losses was deemed necessary.

Investment securities
Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale ("AFS") and are reported as an asset in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of
other comprehensive income ("OCI"). When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities
classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security
classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company's assets and
liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations.
Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the
contractual life of the security.
For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost basis, a credit loss
allowance is established, with the credit portion of the impairment recognized in earnings. The allowance is measured as the difference between the security's amortized
cost and the present value of expected cash flows, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value at the balance sheet date. Interest accruals, as
well as amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts, are suspended if it becomes unlikely that the full amount due will be collected Interest received after
accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis.
The Company held investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. However, as described in Note 1, the Company is primarily doing business of
in the bitcoin mining sector, and not in the business of investing in securities.
Privately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement
alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Publicly held equity securities are based on fair value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity
securities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Concentration Risk
At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. The cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits
was $2,907 and $28,965 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The accounts offered by the custodian of the Company's
bitcoin, which totaled $431,661 and $56,241 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, are not insured by the FDIC. The Company has not
experienced any losses in such accounts.
The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company's revenue or capital expenditures. In the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2024, revenue is concentrated with one mining pool operator and all bitcoins reside with one custodian. Refer to Note 17 - Major Customers and
Vendors.

# Leases

In accordance with ASC 842-Leases, the Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception. When an arrangement contains a lease, the
Company categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow the
Company to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in "Fixed Assets, net." All other
leases are categorized as operating leases.

The Company records right-of use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted
future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental
borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.

Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will
exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term
of 12 months or less.

Some leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company's decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs
and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has certain leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain, and therefore, options to
renew were factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of September 30, 2024.

For all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components.

# Stock-based compensation

The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of
employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based
compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services
including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company
determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For equity awards granted by the Company that are contingent upon
market-based conditions, the Company fair values these awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model. For discussion of accounting for restricted stock units
("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs"), please refer Note 16 - Stock-Based Compensation.

Loss per share
The Company reports loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 "Earnings Per Share," which provides for calculation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per
share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of
diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. Provided below is the
loss per share calculation for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

($ in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Continuing Operations

Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is the construction or development of assets that have not yet been
placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for machinery and equipment, mining equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements
commences once they are ready for their intended use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the terms of the related leases. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

<sup>(1)</sup> Effective May 1, 2024, the Company reduced the useful life for miners from five years to three years.

In accordance with the FASB ASC 360-10, "Property, Plant and Equipment," the carrying value of property and equipment, and other long-lived assets, is reviewed on a
regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its
estimated fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment expense of approximately $197,000 due to the reduction of the
useful life of miners that were removed from service prior to the originally estimated life and due to the subsequent change in salvage value (see Note 9 - Property and
Equipment). In connection with property and equipment in the Company's discontinued operations, an impairment expense in the approximate amount of $32 was
recognized in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and included in loss from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss.

Business Combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total
purchase price is allocated to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the
information currently available and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset
valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The difference between the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair
value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration transferred is initially recognized at fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a
liability or an asset is remeasured to fair value each period until settlement, with changes recognized in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not
remeasured. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.

The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and
goodwill for the year end September 30, 2024.

| Strategic contract | 5                  |

During the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred the following impairment losses related to bitcoin and goodwill:

($ in thousands)

|                       | 2024 | 2023   | 2022   |

| Impairment of goodwill | \$ - | \$ -   | \$ 12,048 |
| Total impairment loss | \$ - | \$ 7,163 | \$ 24,258 |

Goodwill Impairment Analysis

In accordance with ASC 350-30-35-18A, an entity may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative
impairment test, and has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative analysis. In
completing the 2024 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment for its goodwill. For the qualitative assessment, the
Company considered the most recent quantitative analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, including assumptions used, such as
discount rates, indicated fair values, and the amounts by which those fair values exceeded their carrying amounts. Further, the Company compared actual performance in
fiscal year 2024 to the internal financial projections used in the prior quantitative analyses.

Additionally, the Company considered various other factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, and factors specific to the
Company that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of the reporting units. Lastly, the Company evaluated whether any events have occurred or any
circumstances have changed since that time that would indicate that goodwill may have become impaired since the last quantitative tests.

In completing the 2023 and 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment for its goodwill. The assessments
involved comparing the carrying value of the entity, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04: *Intangibles - Goodwill and Other:
Simplifying the test for Goodwill Impairment*, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value unit exceeds the fair value of the
reporting unit. In determining the fair value for which the quantitative assessment was performed, the Company engaged a valuation specialist to perform the
quantitative impairment analysis. The valuation report included a combination of the market and income approach to test for goodwill impairment. The income approach
is a valuation technique under which the Company estimates future cash flows using the financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using
historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, revenue is projected and applied to fixed and variable cost experience rates to arrive at the future cash flows. A
terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair
value. The discount rate used was the value-weighted average of the Company's estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market
metrics. In determining the estimated fair value, several factors were estimated, including projected operating results, growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated
future cash flows and the discount rate. The market valuation approach evaluated the Company's market value as compared to the net asset balance.

The fiscal year 2024 and 2023 assessments indicated that no impairment of goodwill was necessary.

In completing the 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, there was a \$12,048 impairment recognized. In fiscal 2022, there was a sustained downturn in the price of
bitcoin which caused the carrying value of the Company's goodwill to exceed the fair value.

Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and liability, and contingent consideration

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two
are considered observable and the last unobservable.

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active
exchange markets involving identical assets.

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are
typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments.

Level 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity's own beliefs about
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. Due
to the use of significant unobservable inputs, a change in those inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value
measurement.

The following table presents the Company's financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets on a
recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis
The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is
recognized. The Company's impairment related to its miners held in property and equipment in the year ended September 30, 2024 utilized Level 3 inputs including
future bitcoin prices, transaction fees, and the future global hashrate. The Company's strategic investments are also measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Such
fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. The carrying value of the Company's strategic investments is predominantly adjusted based on
internal discounted cash flow models that use available market data of comparable companies and other unobservable inputs including expected volatility, expected time
to liquidity, and adjustments for other company-specific developments.
Assets and liabilities not measured and recorded at fair value
The Company's financial instruments, including certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, the GRIID note receivable, and loans payable
are not measured at fair value. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair values due to their liquid or short term nature. The fair value of these
financial instruments are based on Level 1 inputs, except for short-term borrowings and loans receivable which would be based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs,
respectively.
Income taxes
The Company's calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions.
The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management's estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be
required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in
depreciation methods of archived images and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, other accrued expenses, and the tax treatment of gains or
losses on the value of digital currency. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.
The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to
change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various
state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse
previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense.
The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in
the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Income tax expense from operations for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $3,344, $2,416 and $0, respectively, which resulted primarily from
maintaining a full valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets.
Segment Reporting
The Company determines its operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, views and evaluates operations,
performance and allocates resources. Since June 30, 2022, the Company's only operating segment is the bitcoin mining business.
Discontinued Operations
The Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of the
majority of its energy assets.

# Page 88 of 134

Through its discontinued operations segment, the Company previously provided energy solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark
II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consisted of engineering, design and software
solutions, custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response, solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems. The Company has since
sold the majority of its assets related to the energy segment, which included software and intellectual property, and inventory. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business. The
Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company's ability to reasonably estimate the amount
of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available with its external and internal counsel to determine
whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.

Reclassifications
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. This includes the grouping of certain balance sheet and statement of cash
flow items into new or revised categories to improve clarity and consistency with current-year classifications.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On March 21, 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2024-01, *Scope Application of Profits
Interest and Similar Awards* ("ASU 2024-01"), which clarifies how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is (1) within the scope of ASC 718 -
*Compensation - Stock Compensation* or (2) not a share-based payment arrangement and therefore within the scope of other guidance. The guidance in ASU 2024-01
applies to all entities that issue profits interest awards as compensation to employees or nonemployees in exchange for goods or services. ASU 2024-01 is effective for
public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-01 on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASC 350-60 which requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in
fair value recorded in net income (loss) in each reporting period. Crypto assets that meet all the following criteria are within the scope of ASC 350-60:

(1)meet the definition of intangible assets as defined in the Codification;

(2)do not provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to or claims on underlying goods, services, or other assets;

(3)are created or reside on a distributed ledger based on blockchain or similar technology;

(4)are secured through cryptography;

(5)are fungible; and

(6)are not created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties. In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of
certain crypto assets.

Bitcoin, which is the sole crypto asset mined by the Company, meets each of these criteria. For all entities, the ASC 350-60 amendments are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual consolidated financial
statements that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning
of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company has elected to early adopt the new guidance effective October 1, 2023, resulting in a $4,183
cumulative-effect change to adjust the Company's bitcoin held on October 1, 2023 with the corresponding entry to accumulated deficit as of October 1, 2023. The tax
effect of the adjustment to record the adoption of ASU 2023-08 was to both decrease the deferred tax asset related to cumulative losses from the fair value adjustments of
bitcoin held by the company and decrease the valuation allowance for gross deferred tax assets by the same amount as the adjustment to record the adoption of the ASU.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, *Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures* ("ASU 2023-09"), which established a new income tax disclosure
requirement in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. Under the new guidance, entities must consistently categorize and provide greater
disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. Companies must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. Companies are required to apply the guidance to
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not intend to early adopt this standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, *Improvements to Disclosures About Reportable Segments* ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires enhanced disclosures
about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple
segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure
requirements. The new guidance is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial
statements and expects to implement the provision for fiscal year ending September 30, 2025.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, *Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers*, which requires contract
assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, as if
it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition
date. The Company adopted the provisions of the accounting pronouncement as of October 1, 2023 and the new standard did not have a material impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2024-03, *Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses*. This ASU requires public business entities to provide additional disclosures in the notes
to financial statements, disaggregating specific expense categories within relevant income statement captions. The prescribed categories include purchases of inventory,
employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization related to oil-and-gas producing activities. The ASU
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statement disclosures.

**3. REVISIONS TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

In connection with the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified
errors in relation to the accounting for income taxes, primarily due to the application of Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") section 162(m) excess executive compensation
and the ability to utilize federal and state net operating loss carryforwards under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The errors had an impact on net
deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The error did not impact total revenues or loss before income tax expense
for any of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

# Page 90 of 134

The Company also reclassified transactions in the September 30, 2023 and 2022 consolidated statements of cash flows from cash used in operating activities to cash used
in financing activities. One of the transactions related to the impact of cash receipts from shares issued under equity offerings but for which the Company has recorded
receivables, which resulted an understatement of cash flows from operating activities in the amounts of $7,576 and $2,014, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively, but should have been reflected as decreases in cash flows from financing activities. The second transaction relates to $5,571 of taxes paid on behalf of
employees on shares withheld for net settlement of restricted stock awards at vesting date and was incorrectly recorded as cash used in operating activities, when it
represented cash used in financing activities.
The Company assessed the materiality of the errors, including the presentation on prior periods consolidated financial statements, on a qualitative and quantitative basis
in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 99, Materiality and SAB No. 108 on Quantifying Financial Statement Errors, codified in Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The Company concluded that these errors and the related impacts did not result in a
material misstatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and our previously issued
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31,
2023, June 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024
The Company has corrected the relevant prior periods of our consolidated financial statements and adjusted the disclosures included within Note 13 - Income Taxes,
including our significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.
A summary of the corrections to the impacted financial statement line items from our previously issued financial statements are presented below:

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In June 2022, the Company determined to make available for sale the asset groups related to its energy segment due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin
mining operations. As a result, the energy segment's results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods
presented. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this segment are separately reported as "assets and liabilities held for sale" as of September 30, 2023 in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Through September 2023, the Company sold the majority of its software and intellectual property assets related to the energy segment and
is in the process of winding-down the remaining assets and liabilities.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company has impaired the assets held for sale and reclassified the remaining warranty liability of $546 to continuing operations as it
winds down the former energy segment, and such liabilities are recorded within accrued liabilities. The results of operations of this segment, for all periods, are
separately reported as "discontinued operations" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Provided below are the key areas of the
financials that constitute the discontinued operations:

## 5. ACQUISITIONS
Pending Acquisitions
### GRIID Infrastructure Inc.
On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "GRIID Agreement") with GRIID Infrastructure Inc., Nasdaq ticker "GRDI", a
Delaware corporation ("GRIID"), and Tron Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction
closed on October 30, 2024 (the "Effective Time" of the merger).

Concurrent with the GRIID Agreement, the Company and GRIID entered into a senior secured term loan credit agreement (the "GRIID Credit Agreement") and a co-
location mining service agreement (the "Hosting Agreement") on June 26, 2024. See Note 7 - Note Receivable from GRIID for more information on the GRIID Credit
Agreement. Pursuant to the Hosting Agreement, GRIID hosted certain of the Company's bitcoin mining equipment at GRIID facilities for a fee defined in the Hosting
Agreement. The Hosting Agreement had an initial service term of one year with seven additional renewal terms, each for six months.

The GRIID Agreement provided that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the GRIID Agreement, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into
GRIID (the "Merger"), with GRIID surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and, (2) at the Effective Time of the Merger, holders of each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of GRIID ("GRIID Common Stock") would receive, in exchange for each share of GRIID Common
Stock held immediately prior to the Merger (other than certain excluded shares), that number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company's
common stock ("Company Common Stock") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as defined in the GRIID Agreement) by the
total number of shares of GRIID Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the closing date of the Merger (the "Exchange Ratio").

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time:

*   each GRIID restricted stock unit award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time immediately vested with respect to 100% of the shares of
    GRIID Common Stock subject to such GRIID restricted stock unit award, which shares of GRIID Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
    merger consideration with respect to each share of GRIID Common Stock. Further, each outstanding vested compensatory option to purchase shares of GRIID
    Common Stock was canceled and converted into the right to receive approximately 0.01 of a share of Company Common Stock, which is the number of shares
    equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value (as defined in the GRIID Agreement) over the per share
    exercise price of the applicable option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of GRIID Common Stock subject to such option immediately prior to the
    Effective Time, divided by (ii) $16.587, which represents the volume-weighted average price of Company Common Stock for the two consecutive trading days
    prior to the date of the GRIID Agreement. Any GRIID options that had an exercise price per share of GRIID Common Stock that was equal to or greater than the
    Merger Consideration Value were canceled for no consideration; and

*   each outstanding and unexercised warrant (each, a "GRIID Warrant") to purchase shares of GRIID Common Stock was converted into a warrant to purchase a
    number of shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Warrant"), rounded down to the nearest whole share, that is equal to the product of (A) the
    number of shares of GRIID Common Stock subject to such GRIID Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio.
    The exercise price per share of Company Common Stock underlying such converted Company Warrant is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per
    share exercise price applicable to such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each
    such Company Warrant is on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such GRIID Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
    such terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Merger or as otherwise set forth in the GRIID Agreement.

Upon closing, the Company issued 5,031,254 shares of Company Common Stock on October 30, 2024 with a $12.06 per common share value for a total approximate
value of $60,600.

GRIID RSUS were converted, vested GRIID options were converted or cancelled, and the GRIID Warrants outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time were automatically converted into warrants to purchase 960,395 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock"), at an exercise price of
$165.24 per share of Common Stock (the "Company Public Warrants"), and the GRIID private warrants were converted or assumed.

Due to the timing of the transaction closing on October 30, 2024, the Company is evaluating the impact of this acquisition on its consolidated financial statements; it is
impracticable to disclose the preliminary purchase price allocation. Therefore, disclosures related to the acquisition, including the pro forma consolidated results and
adjustments, amounts of major assets acquired and liabilities assumed, valuation method used to determine the fair value of the consideration transferred, qualitative
factors about the goodwill recognized, and goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes are not yet available. Disclosures regarding the impact of the acquisition
will be provided in subsequent filings as the evaluation is finalized. The primary purpose of the acquisition is to expand its mining capacity geographically. The
acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination.

Mawson Infrastructure Group - Sandersville, GA
On October 8, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a lease for approximately 16.35 acres of real property located in Sandersville, Washington County,
Georgia (the "Mawson Property"), all personal property located on the Mawson Property, and 6,349 application-specific integrated circuit miners (the "ASICs") from
subsidiaries of Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Mawson"), all pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 8, 2022 and an
Equipment Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 8, 2022 (the "Mawson Transaction").
The Company paid the following consideration to Mawson for the Mawson Property: (i) $13,500 in cash; (ii) 1,590,175 shares (the "Closing Shares") of the Company's
common stock (which had a value of $4,803 based upon the closing price of the common stock on October 7, 2022), and (iii) $6,500 in seller financing in the form of a
promissory note. The Company also paid $9,018 in cash within 15 days of the closing for the ASICs.
The following additional contingent consideration was included in the purchase price:
⚫up to 1,100,890 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Earn-out Shares") (which have a value of approximately $3,325 based upon the closing price of
the Company's common stock on October 7, 2022), based upon the number of modular data centers on the Mawson Property occupied by Mawson being emptied
and made available for the Company's use. These Earn-out Shares had been classified as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with ASC
480, and accordingly, were reported at fair value at the end of each reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of this contingent liability was
reduced to $2,840 from $3,325, resulting in a change in fair value of contingent consideration of $484 in Other Income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The shares associated with the earn-out were issued to Mawson in January 2023 (see Note 14 - Stockholders' Equity).
⚫up to an additional $2,000 in a seller-financed earn-out payable at least 60 days post-closing if the Company receives written confirmation that it will be able to
utilize at least an additional 150 MW of power on the Mawson Property by the six-month anniversary of the closing, April 8, 2023. Such written confirmation
was not received by April 8, 2023, and accordingly, the Company determined this contingency criteria was not met by April 8, 2023 and has not paid the
additional consideration. The Company adjusted the contingency liability to $0 as of June 30, 2023 and recognized $2,000 gain in Change in Fair Value of
Contingent Consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
The Company accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of a business. The fair value of the consideration given to Mawson and the other sellers in connection with
the transaction and the allocation of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 820 were as follows:

7. NOTE RECEIVABLE FROM GRIID
On June 26, 2024, concurrent with the GRIID Agreement (see Note 5 - Acquisitions), the Company entered into the GRIID Credit Agreement, which is a senior secured
term loan under which the Company provided a term loan of $55,919 to GRIID, which GRIID is permitted to use solely for certain purposes as set forth in the GRIID
Credit Agreement.
On August 2, 2024, the Company and GRIID amended and restated the GRIID Credit Agreement (as amended and restated, the "A&R GRIID Credit Agreement") to
include, in addition to the term loan amount, a new delayed draw term loan facility of $40,000, which amounts GRIID is permitted to request pursuant to the terms of the
A&R GRIID Credit Agreement and use solely for certain purposes as set forth in the A&R GRIID Credit Agreement. The Company may make one or more delayed
draw term loans (each, a "Draw Loan") to GRIID from August 2, 2024 until the earlier of June 26, 2025 or the termination of the merger transaction defined in Note 5 -
Acquisitions. Each borrowing shall be in a principal amount of $250 or a whole multiple of $100 in excess thereof. The outstanding amount of Draw Loans shall bear an
interest of 8.5% per annum from the date any such Draw Loan is made to the day it is paid in full. Pursuant to the A&R GRIID Credit Agreement, any amounts
borrowed and repaid prior to the maturity date cannot be reborrowed.
Nearing the end of fiscal year 2024, the Company continued to assess the credit risk associated with a note receivable from GRIID. This note primarily financed
infrastructure improvements expected to provide long-term utility and strategic benefit to the Company, which significantly reduces the likelihood of credit loss. Based
on this evaluation, the Company has determined that the risk of credit loss is immaterial and, accordingly, has not recognized a material allowance for credit losses
related to this note. The Company monitored this exposure, but has acquired GRIID prior to the report date as discussed in the Note 5 - Acquisitions and Note 19 -
Subsequent Events.
The maturity date of the term loan is deemed to be the earlier of (i) June 26, 2025, or (ii) 90 days after the termination of the merger transaction between the Company
and GRIID under the GRIID Agreement (other than a termination resulting solely from the breach of the Company). On the maturity date, the principal and any accrued
but unpaid interest will be due and payable. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum. This note matured as part of the acquisition of GRIID, subsequent
to the balance sheet date, as noted above. The GRIID Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default for a term loan
of this type.
As of September 30, 2024, the Note receivable from GRIID balance was $60,919 and interest receivable balance included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets
was $1,286, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

8. INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVES
As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total investments of $2,750 and $3,423, respectively, comprised of the following:

Interest Rate Swap Derivative
In relation to the Company's Western Alliance Bank Credit Agreement entered into in August 2024, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement (see Note 12 -
Loans) for which the interest rate swap is not a designated hedge. As of September 30, 2024, the Interest Rate Swap Derivative was fair valued at a $100 unrealized loss
which is included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

International Land Alliance, Inc.
On November 5, 2019, the Company entered in a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") with International Land Alliance, Inc. ("ILAL"), a Wyoming

ILAL Series B Preferred Stock (Investment in Debt Securities) and Embedded ILAL Derivative Asset
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the "Series B Preferred Stock") for an aggregate
purchase price of $500 (the "Stock Transaction"), less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends in-kind at a rate of 12% per
annum and was redeemable on August 6, 2020. The Series B Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer the discussion on embedded
derivative assets below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August
6, 2020, they are now redeemable at the Company's option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The Series B Preferred Stock is recorded as an
AFS debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. Any change in the fair values of AFS debt securities are reported net of income
tax as an element of Other Comprehensive income.
The Company accrued no interest (net of allowance) on its available-for-sale debt securities, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of the
Company's investment in the Series B Preferred Stock was $918 and $726 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has included gain on fair
value of Series B Preferred Stock amounting to $192 and $116 for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as part of other comprehensive income in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
The Company has deemed the variable conversion feature (the "ILAL Derivative Asset") of Series B Preferred Stock an embedded derivative instrument in accordance
with ASC 815, *Derivatives and Hedging*. This topic requires the Company to account for the ILAL Derivative Asset on its balance sheet at fair value and account for
changes in fair value as a derivative gain or loss. Changes in fair value of the ILAL Derivative Asset are presented as Other income (expense) in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Total fair value of investment in ILAL Derivative Asset as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,832 and $2,697, respectively and as included in Derivative assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company fair values the debt security as a straight debt instrument based on liquidation value, accrued interest to date, and an
estimated 60% recovery rate for first-lien debt, which is an unobservable input. The fair value of the ILAL Derivative Asset is based on the difference in the fair value of
the Series B Preferred Stock determined as a straight debt instrument and the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock if converted as of the reporting date.

Commitment shares - Common stock of ILAL
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company received 350,000 shares (commitment shares) of ILAL's common stock. The commitment shares were fully
earned at the time of execution of the agreement. The Company sold 334,611 shares at various prices and fair valued the remaining 15,389 shares at the closing stock
price of ILAL as of September 30, 2021. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company sold 15,389 commitment shares, and recorded realized gain on sale
of shares for $1.

Investment in Equity Securities - LawClerk
In February 2020, the Company made a $250 strategic relationship investment in LawClerk for 200,000 Series A Preferred Shares of LawClerk. This investment is
recorded on a cost basis and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.
The Company annually performs impairment analysis on this investment and concluded that the investment was not recoverable and accordingly recorded an
impairment of $250 for the year ended September 30, 2022.

In April 2024, a bitcoin halving event took place. A bitcoin halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the block reward for bitcoin miners by
50%. This directly impacts the Company's revenue generation from mining activities. As a result of the bitcoin halving event and the execution of the 100,000 miner
purchase option for new Bitmain Antminer S21 Pro models (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies), the Company concluded that various miner models (S19J,
S19 J Pro and S19 J Pro+) would be removed from service and replaced with newer, more efficient miner models. The planned replacement is expected to be completed
by December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company performed an impairment test on the miners planned for replacement, resulting in an impairment charge of
approximately $189,000. The fair value less residual value of the impaired miners will depreciated over the remaining period in which they are operating. Significant
inputs in the fair value calculation was future bitcoin prices, forecasted global hashrate and estimated future power prices.

Effective May 1, 2024, as a result of new information about actual lives of its bitcoin miners based on historical experience and advancements in overall miner
efficiency, the Company has reduced the useful lives of miners from five years to three years. The impact of the change in useful lives of miners from five to three years
increased depreciation expense and loss before income tax expense by approximately $7,261 for the year ended September 30, 2024, and decreased basic and diluted
earnings per share by $0.03 for the year ended September 30, 2024.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company began to engage in transactions to sell off certain miners that had been removed from service. The Company noted that
the prevailing re-sell market rates decreased between June 2024 to September 2024, and as a result, the Company further changed its estimated salvage value of all of its
out of service miners and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $7,800 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The combined impairment charges for the
year ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately $197,000, which is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as
"Impairment expense - fixed assets".

The Company placed in service property and equipment of $570,931 during the year ended September 30, 2024, which included $7,190 in machinery and equipment
acquired in equipment loan transactions. This increase in fixed assets primarily consisted of miners and mining equipment amounting to $472,670. Assets acquired
through acquisition transactions (see Note 5 - Acquisitions) resulted in an additional $87,239 in total assets placed in service. Additionally, in January 2024, the
Company purchased raw land next to the Sandersville, GA location for approximately $1,038.

On April 7, 2023, CleanSpark HQ, LLC ("HQLLC"), a single member limited liability company and subsidiary wholly owned by the Company, purchased certain real
property located in Henderson, Nevada (the "Eastern Property") for $4,100. The property consists of office space. The Company utilizes this office space as its new
corporate headquarters. The real property is recorded in building and building improvements and was placed in service in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

On May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale agreement with the Development Authority of Washington County to purchase 16.35 acres of land that
was previously leased by the Company and an additional 10 acres of parcels in Sandersville, GA for a purchase price of $1,300 (the agreement was subsequently
amended in June 2023 to increase the purchase price to $1,400). The leased land had been subject to an operating lease which was acquired by the Company under the
Mawson Transaction. In accordance with ASC 842-Leases, the Company reassessed the lease classification as a finance lease and recorded land at the present value of
the lease term (net of the carrying amount of the operating lease at time of conversion) and the land was recorded at $1,167. The land was also reclassified from finance
lease right of use asset to land upon final payment being made on June 30, 2023.

*Construction in progress:* The Company is expanding its facilities in Georgia, Wyoming and Mississippi, including infrastructure, building, and land improvements to
expand its mining operations.

As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company has outstanding deposits for miners and mining equipment totaling $359,862 and $75,959,
respectively. Such deposits are recorded as long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Office Space Operating Lease and Sublease
The Company also has an operating lease for office space which was previously utilized as its corporate headquarters. In January 2024, the Company ceased usage of
the office space. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company wrote down the right of use asset as it considered the asset to be impaired since the space was not
utilized and the efforts to find a sub-lessee at the time were unsuccessful. The Company impaired the right of use asset in the amount of $396 and has recorded this as
"impairment expense - other" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
In July 2024, the Company entered into a sublease agreement in which it sublets the office space to the sublessee for the remainder of the original lease term expiring in
April 2027. Sublease income for the year ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $15. The sublease did not relieve the Company from its original lease

Description of Outstanding Loans

Coinbase Line of Credit and Receivable For Bitcoin Collateral

On August 7, 2024, the Company signed a Master Loan Agreement (the "Master Loan") with Coinbase Credit, Inc. (the "Lender") for a line of credit in which the
Lender will lend the Company certain digital assets or cash. The Master Loan provided has a credit limit of $50,000. On or prior to a drawdown, the Company is
required to pledge collateral, and the Company has opted to pledge bitcoin to be held in a segregated custody account, such that the loan-to-value ratio of principal
outstanding of the loan and the fair value of collateral is equal to or less than 64%. If the value of the collateral under the credit facility decreases past a specified margin,
the Company may be required to post additional bitcoin as collateral.

# Page 108 of 134

The Master Loan includes embedded redemption features, which allows the lender to redeem the security before its maturity date ("redemption feature"). The Master
Loan also includes a contingent interest feature that requires additional interest to be paid only if certain conditions are met. One such redemption feature and contingent
interest feature is in the event of default, including failure to maintain sufficient collateral, the Lender may liquidate the collateral to satisfy the outstanding loan balance
or charge incremental interest at the federal funds rate upon the under-collateralized portion of the loan. The Company assessed the embedded redemption features and
the contingent interest feature and determined the features are clearly and closely related to the line of credit and do not require bifurcation. Upon transfer of the bitcoin,
the Lender has the exclusive right to sell, pledge and rehypothecate the bitcoin without notice to the Company. Either party can terminate a loan with two days' notice to
the other party. As of the date of this report, no such termination has occurred.
The Company drew $50,000 from the line of credit in August 2024, and concurrently transferred bitcoin to the Lender as collateral at fair value of $78,130. Pursuant to
the terms, the line of credit initially bore interest of 9% per annum and has no defined maturity date but is terminable by either the Lender or the Company with notice.
During September 2024, the interest rate on the line of credit was adjusted to 8.5% per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the Coinbase line
of credit was $50,000 at a rate of 8.5% per annum.
Since the Lender has the rights to sell, pledge and rehypothecate the bitcoin during the term of the Master Loan, the Company derecognized the bitcoin transferred as
collateral. As the Company has the right to receive the bitcoin back from the Lender upon the repayment of the line of credit, the Company recorded a corresponding
Receivable for bitcoin collateral. The Receivable for bitcoin collateral is measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded as Change in fair value of bitcoin
collateral under the Other Income category. As of September 30, 2024, 1,229 bitcoin was posted as collateral for the line of credit at a total cost basis of $76,444 and a
fair value of $77,827.

*Western Alliance Bank Credit Agreement*

13. INCOME TAXES
The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently.
FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company's opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully
utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded.
Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, the Company has calculated its federal taxes using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21%. U.S. Tax codes and
laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.
For the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company's loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes were as follows:

Deferred income taxes are the result of timing differences between GAAP accounting and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, timing of income and expense
recognition of certain items, and tax attributes such at net operating loss carry-forwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded
in the balance sheet, net of valuation allowance. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an
ongoing basis. In evaluating its deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. This assessment requires
significant judgment.
The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

In accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company evaluates its deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required.
Pursuant to U.S. income tax accounting standards, companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the
consideration of all available evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities. To
fully utilize the net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward, the Company will need to generate sufficient future taxable income in each respective jurisdiction. Due
primarily to the Company's history of losses, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 will not be realized.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $332,586 of federal and $146,973 of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, of
which federal net operating loss carryforwards of $325,943 have an indefinite life. The federal net operating losses will begin to expire on September 30, 2025, while
state net operating losses will begin to expire in the year ending September 30, 2036.

The Company's ability to utilize its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and future
taxes, respectively, may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that may have resulted in a change in ownership as defined by Internal Revenue Code
Section 382 ("Section 382") or comparable provisions of state law. Tax attributes that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as
carryforwards until they expire and can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryover period subject to the limitation in each year. Given the
Company's significant U.S. tax attributes, we continuously monitor potential ownership changes under Section 382. During the year, the Company completed a detailed
study and determined an ownership change (as defined under Section 382) occurred during the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter of 2020, and second quarter of 2023,
triggering the application of Section 382. We do not currently expect any resulting Section 382 limitations on the use of our tax attributes to have a significant impact on
our financial statements.

The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are
measured at the largest amount that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the
change in judgment occurs.

The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, if applicable. The Company has no liability, interest or penalties
for unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not anticipate the need to record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the coming
year.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. The 2020-2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the IRS and
various state taxing authorities, although the Company is not currently under examination in any jurisdiction.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to recognize $8,503 of stock-based compensation for the non-vested outstanding options over a weighted-average
period of 2.39 years.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
The Company grants RSUs that contain either a) service conditions, b) performance conditions, or c) market performance conditions. RSUs containing service
conditions vest monthly, quarterly or annually. RSUs containing performance conditions generally vest over 1 year, and the number of shares earned depends on the
achievement of predetermined Company metrics and may also include a service condition. RSUs that contain market conditions will vest based on the terms of the
agreement and generally are either 1 year or over the employee's term of employment.
The Company recognizes the expense equal to the total fair value of the RSUs on the grant date. The time-based RSUs granted were valued equal to the stock price on
the grant date and the value of market-based and performance based RSUs were valued utilizing the Monte-Carlo valuation model. The expense is recognized ratably
over the requisite service period and forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

# Legal contingencies
In addition to the legal matters disclosed below, the Company may from time to time be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for
amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Hasthantra v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al.
On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins ("Bishins"), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the "Class"), filed a class action complaint in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its officers, including the Company's CEO and the Executive
Chair (such action, the "Class Action").

On December 2, 2021, the court appointed Bishins and Darshan Hasthantra as lead plaintiffs, and on February 1, 2024, the Court entered a voluntary dismissal on behalf
of Bishins.

The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on February 28, 2022 alleging that, between December 10, 2020 and August 16, 2021, defendants made material
misstatements and omissions in relation to disclosures surrounding the Company's acquisition of ATL and its anticipated expansion of bitcoin mining operations. The
plaintiffs seek certification of the Class, an award of compensatory damages and an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation.

To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action. Discovery is currently proceeding.

The Company believes that the claims asserted are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate
potential losses, if any, that may arise.

Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Actions

directors of the Company, including the Company's Executive Chair, CEO, former CFO, and certain other members of the Board of Directors. This and other related
filings were consolidated by the Court on June 29, 2021 (the "Consolidated Ciceri Action").

The claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Action include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of
corporate assets. The plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, monetary damages and the imposition of additional corporate governance and internal controls.

On June 27, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee ("SLC") comprised of independent directors to intervene in the case,
investigate, evaluate and prosecute as appropriate any and all claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Action as well as the Consolidated Smith Action (as defined
below). On October 23, 2023, the Consolidated Ciceri Action was stayed to allow the SLC to intervene, investigate and determine an appropriate course of action for the
claims alleged, which stay was later extended up to November 30, 2024. On October 16, 2024, the SLC filed a motion to defer to the SLC's determination that the claims
in the Consolidated Ciceri Action should be dismissed. On October 28, 2024, the court ordered the parties' stipulation wherein the parties agreed to submit a status
update to the court by November 30, 2024 and meet and confer regarding a proposed briefing schedule.

The Company believes that the claims raised in the Consolidated Ciceri Action are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. At this time, the Company is
unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Consolidated Ciceri Action.

Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions

District Court of the State of Nevada in Clark County against officers and directors of the Company, including the Company's Executive Chair, CEO, former CFO, and

was later extended to November 30, 2024. On October 16, 2024, the SLC filed a motion to defer to the SLC's determination that the claims in the Consolidated Smith
Action should be dismissed. On October 31, 2024, the court ordered the parties' stipulation, wherein the parties agreed to submit a status update to the court by
November 30, 2024, and meet and confer regarding a proposed briefing schedule.

Plan. Awards granted pursuant to the 2025 LTIP are in addition to cash annual bonus awards and annual time-based RSU awards, if any, and are a key element of the
Company's compensation program.
On October 2, 2024, the Committee granted 2025 LTIP Awards to the executive officers and other executives. The value of these awards is based on the Company's
achievement of pre-determined performance metrics, including total growth, uptime, efficiency, and stockholder return. The Company's performance on these metrics
will be evaluated relative to its peer group, expressed as a percentile. This relative performance determines the percentage of granted RSUs that recipients will earn,
ranging from 0% to 200% of the awarded amount. If the Company achieves 100% of the target performance, the total RSUs earned would be approximately 4,967,000.
Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock
On October 25, 2024, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation, which amendment increased the number of

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO")). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting, as described below. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance
because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with the authorization of our Board and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, management identified the
following material weaknesses:
•The Company did not design and maintain effective information systems general controls over program change management, logical access and segregation of
duties for our general ledger. Specifically, we did not maintain documentation to support the operation of our controls over change management for the
Company's general ledger, and the assignment or permissions to users which allowed certain users to create new users and assign those users existing predefined
roles in the general ledger, which could result in an override of existing internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of this material weakness
affected the design of internal controls related to various assertions in certain financial statement line items such that internal controls were not effective for cash
and cash equivalents, bitcoin, receivable from bitcoin collateral, note receivable from GRIID, property and equipment, deposits on miners, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, loans payable, deferred income taxes, stockholders' equity, bitcoin mining revenue, cost and expenses, share-based payments, and income tax
expense.
•The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to address the accounting for property plant and equipment, and deposits on miners.
•The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over payroll, including controls over the use of information from its third-party payroll service
provider, maintaining appropriate segregation of duties and processing of payroll.
• The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to safeguard cash that could result in the issuance of cashier's checks without any independent
oversight.

These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial
results. Based on these material weaknesses, management concluded that at September 30, 2024, internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our
independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, P.C., has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2024, which appears on page F-2.
Following identification of the material weaknesses and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended
September 30, 2024. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this
Form 10-K.

**MANAGEMENT'S PLAN FOR REMEDIATION**

The Company's Board of Directors and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of its consolidated financial statements seriously.
Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are
remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following:

*Material weakness over design of information systems general controls*
The planned remediation actions include the following:
* Removed users' access within the general ledger system that allowed a user to create users and also perform accounting transactions;
* Implemented quarterly reviews of user access logs by individuals who do not perform accounting transactions in the general ledger;
* Redesigned and implemented relevant complementary user entity controls identified in third-party service organization system organization and control reports;
* Expanded the management and governance over IT system controls, including the hiring of a Systems Analyst and an IT Analyst;
* Redesigned and implemented controls over the completeness and accuracy of information used in the operation of controls, including data used in the
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements; and
* Redesigned and implemented controls over logical access, including user access provisioning, termination, and periodic review for all financial reporting
systems.

*Material weakness design of property plant and equipment and deposits on miners.*
The planned remediation actions include the following:
* Redesign and implementation of controls related to the counting of received property, plant and equipment;
* Design and implement controls over the completeness and accuracy of information used in the operation of controls, including data used in the preparation of
condensed consolidation financial statements;
* Implement controls related to the miner receiving process to ensure adequate documentation is maintained to support the accounting for miners in transit and
period-end balances; and
* Conduct training related to documentation, policies and procedures for shipping, receiving and counting of property, plant and equipment.

Material weakness in the design of controls related to the Company's use of its third-party payroll service provider and payroll processing.
The planned remediation actions include the following:
•Redesign and implement controls to address segregation of duties issues when processing, approving and submitting payroll.
•Implement controls related to confirmation of payrolls processed are same as those approved.
•Restrict administrator access to individuals who do not have responsibility to process, approve or submit payroll.
Material weakness related to the design of internal controls to safeguard cash assets
The planned remediation actions include the following:
•Design and implement a control to require two approval signatures for cashier check requests; and
•Enhance the design of controls related to cash reconciliation procedures verifying cashier checks issued.
While these remedial actions are designed to correct the material weaknesses, changes to internal controls over financial reporting require operation for a sufficient
period of time in order for management to evaluate and test the operating effectiveness. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these
changes for a sufficient period of time prior to concluding that these controls are designed and operating effectively, and the material weaknesses can be considered
remediated.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Except for the material weaknesses and the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Item 9B. Other Information
None of the Company's directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024.
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections
None.
